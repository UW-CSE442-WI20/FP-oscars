    Can I help you in some way?
      I'll get you for that.

    Put this up
     your ass. 

      The name is Miller.    Peppy Miller!

     Fantastic! I've been given a lead role!
     Isn't it wonderful?!
     Gadgets!
     We have to talk, George.
     I'm unhappy, George.
I don't know, maybe it's because I talk. And
     people hear me.

     People are sick to death of those old actors who
     pull faces to make themselves understood.

     Anyway, it's normal for the young to take over
     from the old, that's life. Make way for youth!
I wanted to talk, I...

    I saw Tears of Love.
    About last night... 
OK! Well, we'll be off now.   I'll call you soon.
     Bye!

     Take me home. I'd like to be alone.

    If only he could talk!
     

Do you think he could come rest up at my place?

      
I've got to go. I have to be on set for nine
      o'clock.

     George is a silent movie actor. He belongs to the
      past. Today he's a nobody.

       
 I'm stopping work. It's him or me.

      What I mean is it's either him AND me! Or neither
      of us!

      I'm blackmailing you, get it?!
 
I feel so awful. I only wanted to help you. To
      take care of you...
You've got so much that no one else has...

       
I know what you have that no one else does.
