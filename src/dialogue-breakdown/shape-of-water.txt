	GILES / NARRATOR
	If I spoke about it- If I did- what
	would I tell you, I wonder? Would I
	tell you about the time...? It
	happened a long time ago- in the
	last days of a fair Prince’s
	reign... Or would I tell you about
	the place? A small city near the
	coast but far from everything
	else... Or would I tell you about
	her? The princess without voice...
	Or perhaps I would just warn you of
	the about the truth of these facts
	and the tale of love and loss and
	the monster that tried to destroy
	it all...
	Slowly, she gets up. An ambulance red light briefly
	illuminates the apartment, its siren fading rapidly.
	Barefoot, she heads to the bathroom: We see that light is
	emanating from her FLOORBOARDS.
	Music and dialogue leaks up through the floorboards too.
	She readies the bathtub
	DIALOGUE
	“... No God could be pleased with
	the death of a child at the
	altar...”
	DIALOGUE
	“...Who’s the man?”
	Mahlon, the Judean artisan...”
	GILES
	Did the sirens wake you up?
	It’s a fire. The chocolate factory.
	It rained a little - not enough to
	put it out... Rains are late this
	year... You smell that? Toasted
	cocoa. Tragedy and delight- hand in
	hand...
	Oh, Darling child. I’d waste away
	to nothing without you looking
	after me. I am the proverbial
	starving artist am I not?
	Oh- watch that- Bojangles- the
	stair dance.
	Will you look at that? Very hard to
	do. Cagney did it- different- but
	beautiful- we should watch that one
	day...
	Elisa: Wake me up when you come
	back. Breakfast’s on me, Child.
	MR. ARZOUMANIAN
	Elisa- when yoo bring the rentstay for the bible moovie, eh?
	Theatre’s empty...
	YOLANDA
	Hey- watch it, Dummy!!
	ZELDA
	Leave her alone, Woman. I was
	keeping her place.
	YOLANDA
	I get reported- I come looking for
	you and the mute...
	ZELDA
	You do that, Yolanda. You do that
	ZELDA
	My feet are killin’ me already- We
	ain’t started and my feet are
	already killin’ me
	I wear ‘em low-heeled shoes and it
	hurts just the same. My toes get
	all bunched up- and I feel like
	dyin’. Lord.
	ZELDA
	Made Brewster pigs in a blanket
	tonight before leavin’. Fresh doughthe good sausages- thick- and Boy,
	he just ate ‘em up.
	No thank-yous- no yum-yums- not a
	peep, tho- Man is silent as the
	grave. But if farts were flattery,
	honey- he would be Shakespeare8
	ZELDA
	Then I get home and I make him
	breakfast. Bacon and eggs and
	buttered toast. I butter the man’s
	toast, Elisa. Both sides- As if he
	were a child... And I don’t get a
	“Thank You”
	ZELDA
	Hey- Lou- Lou! You boys mind
	throwing the trash in the bin?
	That’s what it’s for...
	Yes. That’s what it’s for... Hard
	to believe, uh?
	LOU
	Alright. Alright. Sorry Zelda.
	ZELDA
	I don’t know Honey. I don’t know
	what they’re doing.
	Mostly making a Goddam mess is what
	I’d say...
	FLEMING
	Zelda, please- Watch the volume.
	And, there’s no call for the
	blaspheme, please
	ZELDA
	Yessir, sorry, Mr. Fleming, SirFLEMING
	A moment of your time- Today, we
	will be receiving a new team and
	asset here in T-4. This here is Dr.
	Robert Hoffstetler...
	I don’t want to bolster - or
	overstate the matter-
	-but this may be the most sensitive
	asset ever to be housed in this
	facility...
	HOFFSTETLER
	They have to leave10
	FLEMING
	Yes- yes
	HOFFSTETLER
	You: help me move the cylinder into
	the compressor! There!
	ZELDA
	Will you look at this?
	Look- Some of the best minds in our
	country- peeing all over the floor
	in this here facility.
	There's pee freckles on the
	ceiling!! How do they get it up
	there?
	Just how big a target do they need,
	you figure? They get enough
	practice that’s for sure. My
	Brewster, no one ever called him a
	great mind, even he hits the can
	seventy percent of the time.
	STRICKLAND
	No. No. That’s alright... Go on
	You ladies seem to be chatting
	enjoyably. Girl talk no doubt.
	Don't mind me.
	Look but don’t touch-
	That lovely dingus there is an
	Alabama Howdy-do...
	Molded grip handle. Low-current,
	High-voltage electric shock cattle
	prod- That's for you to know, not
	to tell.
	I’m Strickland. Security.
	ZELDA
	Fleming's security.
	STRICKLAND
	Not while I’m here.
	Saw you both at T-4.
	ZELDA
	We’re cleared, Sir.
	STRICKLAND
	I know. I checked.
	Doesn’t it get lonely? The
	graveyard shift?
	ZELDA
	Gets quiet. That’s for sure.
	She offers him a clean towel. “NO”
	STRICKLAND
	Man washes his hands before or
	after tending to his needs. That
	tells you a lot about that man.
	He does it both times? Points to a
	weakness of character...
	Ladies? Very pleasant chatting with
	you both.
	HOFFSTETLER
	May I help you?
	Oh! You're... not in uniform- Did
	you forget something-? Inside?
	Wait- Wait!
	GILES
	Yeah. I’m wearing the hair. Watch
	out for that car...
	Does it look good?
	GILES
	It was eternal, see? Tantalus never
	even achieved the escape of death.
	The fruit on the branches was
	always just out of reach...
	PIE GUY (O.S.)
	Thank yeew. Y’all come back,
	y’heah?
	GILES
	...the water in the stream always
	receded just when he stooped to
	drink. And that's why we say things
	like, look at those tantalizing
	pies—
	I don’t like the colors either, but
	they taste alright. Try it. My
	treat. You want cold milk?
	PIE GUY
	Welcome to Dixie Doug’s, folks.
	That’ll be all?
	GILES
	For the moment.
	PIE GUY
	Hey- I’ve seen you in here before,
	right?
	GILES
	Oh, well- I- yes- I’ve been here. A
	couple of times as a matter of
	fact.
	PIE GUY
	Partial to key lime pie?
	GILES
	A craving I indulge in. It cannot
	possibly be good for me. Nothing I
	like is...
	PIE GUY
	Oh, no- It’s a mighty fine pie, key
	lime.
	GILES
	And the color is so vivid!!
	PIE GUY
	Vivid! Now, there’s a word Ithere’s a word for ya...
	GILES
	A vivid word! It most certainly is.
	And would you be the famous “Dixie
	Doug” himself?
	PIE GUY
	Heck, no. Pies are trucked down
	throughout the country. It's called
	“franchising”, see?
	There’s thirty-two Dixie Doug’s all
	over the country.
	They give us the spinners, the
	signage- That there’s “Pie Boy” our
	mascot. They tell us what we gotta
	say— What to wear and such— there's
	a manual lays it all out. They
	figured out what people like,
	scientifically. I don't really talk
	that way, I'm from Ottawa.
	GILES
	You had me completely fooled.
	“That’s-a-great-a-pie...” The
	Little guy is Italian is he?!
	PIE GUY
	I guess so
	GILES
	How clever!
	PIE GUY
	Well, Thank yewww. Y'all come back
	now, y'heah?
	GILES
	“Y’all come back” Do you think he
	meant it? He had noticed me- you
	heard that yourself.
	Well, this pie is rather sordid,
	but- Don’t spit it out- We could
	try a different flavor next time.
	Well- you wanna save it- for later?
	Dear God- Change that awfulness- I
	don’t want to see all that
	There- Now- That’s better... Oh,
	would you look at Betty! To be
	young and beautiful. If I could
	take this brain of mine- this heartand put in it- If I could go back
	in time, when I was eighteen- I
	didn’t know anything about anythingI- would give myself a bit of
	advice, I tell you
	I’d say: Take better care of your
	teeth and fuck. A lot more.
	It’s very good advice
	ZELDA
	Short people are mean. Mean...
	ZELDA
	Short people are mean... mean...
	You listen to me- they have a
	grudge- a big chip on their tiny
	little shoulders. I’ve never met a
	short man that stays nice all the
	way through, no, Sir- mean little
	backstabbers, all of ‘em. Maybe
	it’s the air down there, not enough
	oxygen or something.
	My Brewster- he’s no Towering Titanand he never raises his chin. He
	gets angry- you get the eyes. But
	the chin stays down...
	HOFFSTETLER
	Help! He’s losing blood! Find
	something for a tourniquet.
	ZELDA
	Come on. Come on. Let them help
	them. Come on Elisa
	ZELDA
	Think the Russians broke in? I
	don’t think so. And If they did,
	Duane’s meatloaf will kill them
	all, honey.
	ZELDA
	It was two shots- you hear'em?
	Alright- Three- and that scream.
	Heavens. Whatever goes on in this
	place...
	FLEMING
	You two. Come with me.
	ZELDA
	Now, Mr Fleming, Sir? Any chance we
	might conclude our dinner?
	FLEMING
	Now. Grab your carts and bring your
	code cards.
	FLEMING
	Heavens to Betsy: we’re in a
	pickle. We’re in a real pickle
	now...
	FLEMING
	You will have exactly twenty
	minutes, to render this- this lab
	immaculate and so on and so forth.
	Do you understand? Twenty minutes.
	ZELDA
	Sweet dancing Jesus on the head of
	a pin- what went on in here? That’s
	blood, hon- I tell you- may be all
	gunked up- But that’s blood...
	Help me mop it, Hon. Sooner we get
	out of here the better...
	That a cigar?
	Aaagh!! Don’t touch that!! It’s a
	finger!! They’re all fingers!!
	I’m gonna call somebody. Stay here,
	Honey. Jesus Lord, fingers.
	She leaves- Elisa stays. She looks for the gold band.
	Where are the fingers?
	GILES
	I do believe you, darling, but are
	you sure it was alive? I once saw a
	mermaid- in a carnival tent. It was
	a monkey sewn to the tail of a
	fish. Looked real to me.
	I apologize. But I have a deadlineYou know the Corn Flakes- they were
	created as a cure for masturbation.
	It doesn’t work.
	Oh, Alice Faye just started...
	She was a huge star- And one dayone day she just couldn’t take the
	bullshit, the backstabbing, anymore
	and she just walked away from
	everything. Just walked away- To
	live the way she wanted to
	Ta-da! You like it? It’s not bad,
	is it? For being shit? Now, eat, go
	to bed. Rest- I get paid- we get
	pie! OK, not pie. I get pie. You
	get whatever you want. My treat.
	Wish me luck.
	BERNIE
	Green. They want the gelatin to be
	green now.
	GILES
	But I was told red.
	BERNIE
	New concept. All the new flavors
	are green: Celery, apple, Italian.
	That’s the future now. Green.
	And they want them happier- the
	family.
	GILES
	Happier? The Father looks like hehe just discovered the missionary
	position... And the kids look like
	the have electrodes up their- What
	are they happy about?
	BERNIE
	Giles.
	GILES
	What are they happy about?
	BERNIE
	The future, Giles.
	Sorry, you know how it is. You do
	what they say, then they change
	everything. Too bad— this is nice
	work.
	GILES
	It is nice work, isn’t it? One of
	my best.
	BERNIE
	How are you holding up? Are you
	drinking?
	GILES
	Not a drop.
	BERNIE
	Getting any work since you left
	Klein & Saunders?
	GILES
	Since I was asked to leave. By you.
	BERNIE
	We’re not gonna get into that now.
	I like you. You know I do.
	Are you painting? Your own art?
	GILES
	I want back, Bernie.
	BERNIE
	We’ll see. Now- do this. The client
	wanted photographs. Photographs’s
	what’s coming- I sold them on this
	Can you have it Monday? Green?
	ZELDA
	Elisa.
	What am I doing here? What are you
	doing here?
	Okay. Cleaning. Hey honey, Mr. “I
	pee with my hands on my hips” wants
	to see us both. I don’t know why.
	Lord it better be short, because it
	is late and my feet are killing me.
	STRICKLAND
	Zelda D. Fuller. How long have you
	two known each other, Zelda?
	ZELDA
	About Ten years, Sir.
	STRICKLAND
	No siblings, Zelda?
	ZELDA
	No, Sir...
	STRICKLAND
	That’s not common, is it? For your
	people?
	ZELDA
	Momma died after me- After I was
	born.
	STRICKLAND
	What does the “D” stand for?
	ZELDA
	My “D”? Delilah, Sir- on account of
	the bible.
	STRICKLAND
	Dee-Li-lah. . .
	ZELDA
	Beg your pardon?
	STRICKLAND
	Delilah- she betrays Samson- Lulls
	him to sleep, cuts his hairPhilistines torture him, humiliate
	him- burn his eyes out. Turned him
	into a thing26
	ZELDA
	Guess my momma didn’t read the good
	book close enough..
	STRICKLAND
	And you-
	Elisa... Elisa Esposito. Doesn’t
	Esposito means “Orphan”?
	Our Lady of Sorrows Orphanage in
	Putnam... Putnam?
	ZELDA
	They found her- by the river- in
	the water...
	STRICKLAND
	That what they told you, uh?
	It was you that found my fingers?
	Three hours in surgery - They
	rebuilt the first phalanx- heresutured the tendons. Don’t know if
	it’s going to take-
	There was mustard on them.
	A paper bag. Best you could do?
	ZELDA
	It’s all we had...
	I answer mostly, on account that
	she can’t talk.
	Long pause.
	STRICKLAND
	What do you mean she can’t talk?
	ZELDA
	She can’t.
	STRICKLAND
	She can’t? Is she deaf?
	ZELDA
	Mute, sir.
	STRICKLAND
	Mute.
	That what did it? Cut your voice
	box?
	ZELDA
	She sez: Since she was a baby...
	STRICKLAND
	Who would do that to a baby? This
	world is sinful. Wouldn't you say,
	Dee-li-lah
	Well- lemme say this upfront.
	You clean that lab. You get out.
	The thing we keep in there, is an
	affront. Do you know what an
	affront is, Zelda?
	ZELDA
	Something offensive, Sir.
	STRICKLAND
	That’s right- That’s right- And I
	should know.
	I’ve dragged that filthy thing- out
	of the river muck in South America
	and all the way here-
	And along the way we didn’t get to
	like each other much.
	You may think that thing looks
	human- Stands on two legs, but we’re created in the Lord’s image.
	And you don’t think that’s what the
	Lord looks like, do you?
	ZELDA
	I wouldn’t know, Sir. What the Lord
	looks like.
	STRICKLAND
	Well, human, Zelda. He looks like a
	human. Just like me... Or even you.
	A little more like me, I guess...
	General Hoyt. Thank you for calling
	me back.
	I am, Sir- much better. Pain pills,
	is all- Thank You. Two fingers, yesbut still got my thumb, my trigger
	and my pussy finger-
	Yes, Sir- That’s right- Looking
	forward to your visit, Sir.
	Decisions have to be made about the
	asset, Sir.
	From his window he watches as-
	STRICKLAND
	Pick me up tonight. Nine thirty.
	FLEMING
	Twenty one hundred and thirty hours yes, Sir.
	STRICKLAND
	I’ll take that.
	STRICKLAND
	No pancakes?
	TIMMY
	Dad? Guess what?
	ELAINE
	I’ve gone through half the boxes.
	Can’t find the griddle. But I made
	you cheese and broccoli omelette,
	Sweetie, your favorite.
	TIMMY
	Hey, Dad- Guess what? Guess what?
	ELAINE
	Are you feeling any better? Does it
	hurt?
	STRICKLAND
	Just a little. Pills help.
	TIMMY
	Guess what? We are burying a time
	capsule- at the new school.
	And I wanted to ask you- Do you
	think we’ll all have jet packs, in
	the future?
	STRICKLAND
	That’s right, Son. The future is
	bright. You gotta trust in that.
	This is America.
	ELAINE
	Wash your hands real good sweetie.
	And come upstairs...
	ELAINE
	I kinda like it here. The kids like
	the lawn. Plus- DC is just half an
	hour away, isn’t it?
	STRICKLAND
	It’s still Baltimore, Elaine
	ELAINE
	Oh
	Richard--
	STRICKLAND
	Shh- Silence. Don’t talk. I want
	you in silence.
	ELAINE
	Honey- your hand’s bleeding- ohSTRICKLAND
	Shh- Shh- in silence.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Good morning Mrs. Peabody, how is
	the gout?
	BURLY RUSSIAN
	The sparrow nests on the window
	sill.
	HOFFSTETLER
	What?
	BURLY RUSSIAN
	The sparrow nests on the window
	sill.
	HOFFSTETLER
	And the eagle takes the preyBURLY RUSSIAN
	Uhhh. What?
	HOFFSTETLER
	That’s the password: “And the Eagle
	takes the Prey” Let’s go.
	MIHALKOV
	“Bob.” How are you?
	HOFFSTETLER
	I was sitting like a moron on a
	concrete block in the middle of
	nowhere for an hour. I took three
	taxis to get there. Again.
	Why can’t we just meet here? It’s
	the same restaurant every time!!
	MIHALKOV
	I could change my mind.
	HOFFSTETLER
	But you don’t.
	MIHALKOV
	But I could-
	So- Tell us, “Bob”-
	HOFFSTETLER
	Dimitri, Comrade- Not “Bob.” Who
	names himself with one syllable?
	MIHALKOV
	What is this, Dimitri? Sit- Sit
	HOFFSTETLER
	Anatomical notes- and- Layout of
	the laboratory where the asset is
	being studied. Everything we need
	for the extraction.
	MIHALKOV
	I will pass it on to the
	directorate.
	Distilled four times- arrives by
	diplomatic valise. Minsk. Isn’t
	that your hometown?
	HOFFSTETLER
	We must do it as soon as possible-
	This creature, Mihalkov- I think it
	may be able to communicate.
	MIHALKOV
	Communicate.
	HOFFSTETLER
	With us. I have reason to believe
	it is intelligent. It- it responds
	to language- to music...
	Will you please pass that up also?
	MIHALKOV
	I will.
	Now- eat, Dimitri. They call this
	“Surf-”
	BURLY RUSSIAN
	“...and Turf”.
	MIHALKOV
	“Surf and Turf” A feast. They boil
	the lobsters right here. They
	squeak a little but they are so
	soft and sweet.
	DUANE
	Hey, Zelda, want a smoke?
	ZELDA
	That shit’s not good for you,
	Duane.
	DUANE
	Feels good.
	ZELDA
	It does, doesn’t it?
	C’mon Elisa, just one.
	DUANE
	They can’t see us, they push that
	camera up at break time. With the
	broom
	LOU
	This here’s a blind spot.
	DUANE
	Hey, Elisa, how come you always
	taking all them boiled eggs at the
	cafeteria? Can’t nobody eat seven
	eggs a day.
	ZELDA
	Mind your own, Duane. Leave her
	alone.
	DUANE
	Girl can’t speak but she sure can
	eat.
	STRICKLAND
	Miss me? I took a candy break.
	This? Is it this that scares you?
	You should be used to it by now...
	There you are again. Making that
	god-awful sound. Is that you
	crying? Is that what it is? You
	hurting? Huh? Or maybe you’re
	angry? Yeah. Maybe you’d like to
	get another bite at me.
	I can’t tell- Are you begging?
	‘Cause to me it’s just the worst
	fucking noise I’ve ever heard.
	ZELDA
	Elisa?
	STRICKLAND
	General Hoyt! Welcome, Sir!
	Everything’s ready. Good to have
	you here, Sir!
	GENERAL HOYT
	Good God. Is that it?
	Much bigger than I pictured.
	STRICKLAND
	Ain’t that something? Ugly as sin.
	The natives in the Amazon
	worshipped itGENERAL HOYT
	Well- It sure doesn’t look like
	much of a God right now, does it?
	STRICKLAND
	They were primitives, sir. Tossed
	offerings into the water; flowers,
	fruits, crap like that... Tried to
	stop the oil drill with bows and
	arrows. That didn’t end too well.
	HOFFSTETLER
	What happened? He's bleeding. You
	cannot keep doing thisSTRICKLAND
	It’s an animal, Hoffstetler. Just
	keeping it tame.
	GENERAL HOYT
	“Oxygen osmosis- dioxide exchange.”
	What are we lookin’ at here, Son?
	HOFFSTETLER
	This creature, Sir- I’ve never seen
	anything like like it. Ever. It can
	alternate between two entirely
	separate breathing mechanisms...
	STRICKLAND
	Mudskipper can do that.
	HOFFSTETLER
	You want to put a man in space for
	days, weeks even, he’s going to
	have to endure conditions the human
	body just wasn’t made for. But thisThis means long-term survivability
	in space. This gives us an edge
	against the Soviets.
	GENERAL HOYT
	How long can it breathe outside the
	water?
	STRICKLAND
	Really- Thirty minute intervals.
	It’s been out now, about... twenty
	eight- so we should start to see
	the effects.
	Reality, is, Sir- We don’t know
	jackshit about this thingGENERAL HOYT
	Soviets want it- We know that much.
	Those cockeyed bastards- They send
	a dog up into space- We get a
	laugh. But next thing we know- they
	send a human up -- a Ruskie,
	orbiting our planet, doing God
	knows what? And then who’s
	laughing? Krushchev. That’s who- We
	let him put a dog in space, he
	laughs, puts a commie in space, he
	laughs, puts missiles in Cuba. Have
	we learned nothing?
	STRICKLAND
	Give'm a dog, they take Cuba.
	GENERAL HOYT
	You got that right.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Sir. I would advise
	We need to get him back in the
	water--
	STRICKLAND
	Let us go over the mark for once,
	See where it takes us.
	Scientists- they are like artists:
	They fall in love with their
	playthings.
	Now- Over here, Sir- right hereyou see?
	The creature has a thick jointed
	cartilage separating the primary
	and secondary lungs- Am I
	explaining this correctly, Bob?
	HOFFSTETLER
	Yes- but we’ve been able to getSTRICKLAND
	It makes the X-rays inconclusive...
	HOFFSTETLER
	In principle, yes but, See? This43 
	STRICKLAND
	Sir- If we want to get the edge on
	the Soviets- and I know we can- we
	have to vivisect this thing. Take
	it apart. Learn how it works.
	HOFFSTETLER
	No- no- That would defeat the
	purpose
	Sir? He’s passed out- Please.
	Put him in the tank- The tank. Let
	him pressurize.
	General Hoyt, Sir: You cannotunder any circumstance- kill this
	creature. You cannotGENERAL HOYT
	Count these with me, Son- there’s
	five of them: That means I can do
	whatever the hell I want. You wanna
	plead your case? I’ll listen
	But, end of the day, it is my damn
	decision.
	ZELDA
	What were you doing in there?? What
	were you doing in there??
	Are you crazy? Are you out of your
	damn mind?
	I will not lose my job. God knows
	the last time Brewster brought home
	a dollar...
	If your involved- I’ll get blamed!
	I’ll get sacked!! Yes- i will be!!
	Just to be on the safe side. I’m
	black! They don’t need any other
	reason
	STRICKLAND
	That thing is untamed- Dangerous
	HOFFSTETLER 
	No. We cannot kill it- We cannot
	STRICKLAND
	Russian infiltration
	Every day we keep it here, we risk
	Russian infiltration. We should get
	it over with.
	HOFFSTETLER
	No- we must- please
	HOFFSTETLER
	No- we must wait- please.
	GENERAL HOYT
	Crack the damn thing open. Learn
	what you can and close shop here.
	Give yourself a good pat in the
	back, Strickland. You’ve done it.
	STRICKLAND
	Thank you, Sir.
	GILES
	Get him out???
	GILES
	What are you talking about? No- No
	Absolutely not.
	Because it is breaking the law!
	That’s why.
	We’re probably breaking the law
	right now, just- talking about it.
	Alone? What if he’s alone? What
	about it? We’re all alone! If I- If
	I took you to a Chinese restaurantwould you save every crab?
	“It’s the loneliest thing you’ve
	ever seen...” Well there you goyou just said it. It’s a thing- A
	freak
	I understand what you’re
	OK, OK, calm down- I’ll repeat it to you.
	“And what am I? I move my mouth -
	like him- and I make no sound- like
	him. What does that make me?“
	“All that I am, all that I’ve beenever- brought me here- to him.”
	“Him??” What are you talking about?
	That thing? It’s a “him” now?
	Hey! Watch it!
	“The way he looks at me. He doesn’t
	know what I lack... Or how I am
	incomplete. He just sees me for
	what I am. As I am. And he is happy
	to see me, every time. Every day.”
	“And now I can either save him now
	or let him die. Never see his eyes,
	see me again. I will not let that
	go...”
	I am leaving- stop talking. This is
	important for me, Elisa- Maybe a
	second chance for me- I have to go
	And when I come back I- We will not
	talk about this. Again. There’s
	nothing we can do. What are we,
	Elisa? You and I? Nothing. What can
	we do? Nothing.
	And- I am sorry. But it is not even
	human.
	BERNIE
	Giles!
	GILES
	Hey- I was waiting
	BERNIE
	I know, I’m sorry
	GILES
	We’re going in?
	BERNIE
	Not right this second- you’re
	early.
	GILES
	No. It’s Monday. You said Monday
	BERNIE
	I know- I know I said that- You
	should’ve just mailed the art.
	GILES
	Why? I wanted to show it to you. To
	the team- In person. It’s some of
	my best workBERNIE
	This is not a good time. Maybe
	later.
	GILES
	Sure. No problem. What time is good
	for you, Bernie?
	PIE GUY
	You painted that?
	Wowee- You’re good.
	GILES
	Not as good as a photograph,
	apparently. But it is good, isn’t
	it?
	PIE GUY
	Pfft- I couldn’t paint that. Here:
	on me.
	GILES
	For me?
	PIE GUY
	It’s not key lime- but it’s good.
	GILES
	Thank You.
	PIE GUY
	Don’t mention it. We don’t get many
	like you in here. You seem very
	educated. I like talking to you.
	GILES
	Oh, well- The thing is... That’s
	the thing, I really come here formostly- For thePIE GUY
	The conversation... And the pie is
	mighty fine, ain’t it?
	GILES
	OH, mmmh- I work alone and my best
	friend is not much of a...
	conversationalist.
	PIE GUY
	See? That’s part of the job here.
	Like being a bartender. You serve
	people pie, listen to their
	problems. Get to know them.
	GILES
	I would like- to know you. Better.
	PIE GUY
	What are you doing, Old man?
	GILES
	I- er- you- bought me pie.
	PIE GUY
	I bought pie- For everyone. ‘cause
	I got engaged last night. To that
	young lady over there.
	GILES
	I see...
	PIE GUY
	Hey, no- Not the counter- Just take
	out. You can’t sit there. You want
	something, you order, you take it
	out.
	MOTHER
	But it’s empty... The counter is
	PIE GUY
	All reserved. All day. You don’t
	sit down.
	“Y’all come back, Y’hear?”
	GILES
	You don’t have to talk to them like
	that.
	PIE GUY
	You should leave too. And don’t
	come back. This is a family
	restaurant.
	Hey- You left this
	GILES
	No. Keep it. It’s perfect for you.
	I- I never understood why they are
	so damn happy anyway. So happy
	about a- slab of animal... proteinin- in that shade of green- that
	should come with a warning label..
	But I guess they smile because that
	is their future- Your future. Just
	like your pies- These horrible
	pies. Turning around in their nice,
	shiny glass towers- But tasting
	like ashes in my mouth. Have you
	ever seen a real key lime pie?
	It’s not green. It’s actually
	beautiful. Who makes these pies?!
	Who makes them?? What are they really? Shit. Bright, fake-colored
	shit. Made by no one. Eaten by no
	one... You don’t even know where
	they come from... Do you? You don’t
	even know that...
	PIE GUY
	They come from Albany, Faggot.
	GILES
	I have... no one else- you are the
	only person that I can talk to...
	Whatever this thing is... You need
	it... So- Just tell me what to do.
	MIHALKOV
	Moscow will not support your plan.
	Too risky. Too soon.
	HOFFSTETLER
	What--
	MIHALKOV
	There is not enough time.
	HOFFSTETLER
	But I have told you, they will kill
	it-- And it is sentient. I am sure
	of that now. Did you tell them
	that?
	MIHALKOV
	I did.
	HOFFSTETLER
	And?
	I can do it. Myself and two
	operators.
	MIHALKOV
	No.
	We have only two choices, Dimitri,
	One: You must delay the procedure,
	a week, minimum...
	HOFFSTETLER
	That is not possible.
	MIHALKOV
	I understand. Which brings us up to
	option two.
	Israeli “Popper”- you set it next
	to a fuse box- it will buy you five
	to ten minutes in the dark: no
	cameras- no containment doors- Then
	You inject it with thisHOFFSTETLER
	Inject it?
	MIHALKOV
	Kill it. Destroy it- Are you all
	right?
	HOFFSTETLER
	I came to this country- to learn
	what I could- as a patriot, yesbut also as a scientist. This
	creature- It should not be killed.
	Not by them. Not by us.
	There is still so much we can learn
	MIHALKOV
	We don’t need to learn. We need
	Americans not to learn. They don’t
	learn, we win.
	DEALER
	Cadillac DeVille. Best car ever
	made. V8, 390 CID, clean, crisp
	like a fresh dollar bill. Climb
	right inSTRICKLAND
	I am just idling around.
	DEALER
	AM/FM stereo sound, Air
	conditioner, power windows, power
	breaks, power steering, power
	seats...
	All deluxe interior appointment
	choices. 143 options. The Taj-Mahal
	on wheels.
	STRICKLAND
	I’m not sure about the green.
	DEALER
	Oh, no. Not green, my friend.
	Teal.
	STRICKLAND
	Well, Teal looks green to me.
	DEALER
	But it isn’t, see? It’s a limited
	edition. Twelve coats of paint.
	Polished by hand. All authentic
	chrome detailing. Four out of five
	successful men in America drive a
	Cadillac.
	STRICKLAND
	That a fact?
	DEALER
	This here is the future. And you
	strike me as a man who is heading
	there.
	STRICKLAND
	Where?
	DEALER
	Why- The Future. You are the man of
	the future.
	You belong in this car.
	GILES
	So I will drive down the loading
	dock- at exactly 05:00 am.
	Shifts are changing, yes- So we
	have...
	...five minutes... Five A.M. Five,
	five. Give me your watch. You’ll
	move the camera... We’ll
	synchronize our watches. Just like
	the movies.
	I’m so proud of you. You’re not
	afraid.
	Oh, you are? Very? Don’t tell me
	that! I’m terrified!
	I think it’s some of my best work.
	Michael Parker. A good, trustworthy
	name. Bit butch...
	Age? I thought- fifty one?
	Fifty four?
	Oh, you know? There is no need to
	be rude: Fifty seven- I put the
	hair on, I can pull it off. nowH
	This one or this one? I think this
	one says “Working Man” and Move
	Thor!
	This one- with butterscotch `tiesays “casual but with stylish”. I
	agree. Then we’re ready.
	STRICKLAND
	Sally- could you send Mrs. Esposito
	up to clean a spill?
	STRICKLAND
	You know...? I can’t figure it out
	myself- you’re not much to look at,
	but- go figure- I keep thinking
	about you.
	And I’ve seen you, looking at me.
	You’ve been- looking at me?
	When you say you’re mute... Are you
	entirely silent? Or do you squawk a
	little? Some mutes squawk. Not
	pretty, but
	You should know this: I don’t mind
	the scars. Don’t mind that you
	can’t speak, either.
	When you come right down to it- I
	like it. A lot. Kind of gets me
	going...
	Thought you should know these
	things.
	Hey!
	Bet I can make you squawk a little.
	ZELDA
	Hurry up, Honey- I want to be home
	early.
	HOFFSTETLER
	We need to delay the procedure.
	STRICKLAND
	Knock first.
	HOFFSTETLER
	What?
	STRICKLAND
	Knock before entering my office.
	HOFFSTETLER
	This is urgent
	STRICKLAND
	Go back out. Knock. Then I’ll let
	you in and we’ll talk. That’s the
	protocol. Follow the protocol.
	Come in.
	See? That is the way. Now- Now we
	can talk.
	HOFFSTETLER
	I need more time.
	STRICKLAND
	No.
	HOFFSTETLER
	We shouldn’t kill this creature...
	STRICKLAND
	Look- Don't let the fact that you
	feel like a loser now, that your
	competitive tendencies have been
	engaged—
	HOFFSTETLER
	I'm not competitive! I don't want
	an intricate, beautiful thing
	destroyed.
	STRICKLAND
	Don’t let that cloud your judgement
	HOFFSTETLER
	You're like a child with a
	transistor radio, you think if you
	smash it open you can look at the
	inside, see how it works. But you
	can't. It's smashed. It doesn’t
	work. You kill the music.
	STRICKLAND
	Bob- I don't hear you. Music? That
	thing dies. You learn. I leave. Out
	of here. Settle down. My family
	settles down. Somewhere. Nicer.
	Real. A real city.
	HOFFSTETLER
	This creature- and I am certain of
	this- Is intelligent. Capable of
	language, of understandingemotions.
	STRICKLAND
	So are the Soviets, the Gooks- and
	we still kill them, don’t we?
	Bottom line is, this is not a
	petting zoo- And I don't want to be
	in this shithole any longer than I
	need. Do you?
	Do you?
	HOFFSTETLER
	No, Sir, I don’t.
	STRICKLAND
	A-ha- So I made it so we both win.
	You can thank me later.
	YOLANDA
	Hey- what are you waiting for?
	ZELDA
	Have you seen Elisa?
	HOFFSTETLER
	Did you move the camera? On the
	loading dock?
	Is that where you are taking him?
	Through the service tunnels?
	That’s very smart
	Who do you work for?
	Please tell me you’re not doing
	this alone.
	Good. Listen to me- there are
	certain things you need to know...
	HOFFSTETLER
	Water must be kept at seventy-five
	to eighty-five percent salinity.
	His water must be kept at seventyfive to eighty-five percent
	salinity. Mix one of these inevery three days- Raw protein diet
	is a must.
	In five minutes- I'll meet you at
	the loading dockThe lights will go out, so be
	prepared...
	FLEMING
	Sir, you need to sign this week’s
	release forms...
	GUARD
	This is a restricted entrance, sir.
	GILES
	Laundry pick-up.
	GUARD
	Turn on the light
	You don’t look like laundry.
	GILES
	Thank You.
	GUARD
	Have your pass?
	STRICKLAND
	Who’s that? What’s that van?
	FLEMING
	Gosh- I don’t know, Sir- A laundry
	truck?
	GUARD
	Michael Parker. Is that you?
	GILES
	I am indeed. Michael Parker. Fifty
	seven just as it says right there.
	GUARD
	Step out of the vehicle, sir.
	GILES
	Oh, dear- I am not good at this
	GUARD
	Out of the vehicle. Now.
	GILES
	Would you have believed fiftythree?
	GUARD
	I will not say it again- Out. Now.
	STRICKLAND
	Follow me.
	ZELDA (O.S.)
	Elisa!
	Are you out of your mind?!!
	GUARD
	Get out. Now!
	GILES
	I swear I’m not doing this on
	purpose. Actually, mechanical
	objects and I
	HOFFSTETLER
	Go! Now!
	GILES
	Who the--??
	HOFFSTETLER
	She’s waiting for you at the dock!
	Go! Now!
	STRICKLAND
	The laundry Van
	GILES
	Elisa. Wha- who is this man? He had
	a needle and...
	He’s with us?
	GILES
	Oh, God- He is so beautiful!
	Are we ready? Are we ready?
	GILES
	Did I do that? Are you okay?
	FLEMING
	Guns down. We need to re-assess.
	Let him work. Let him do his thing.
	STRICKLAND
	Teal...
	GILES
	Salt? What are you talking about...
	Salt?
	GILES
	Elisa!
	STRICKLAND
	Israeli “Popper.” Smell the ozone.
	The Russians hate the Jews, but
	can’t get enough of their gadgets-
	How did they get in?!
	FLEMING
	We have vehicle track marks, sir.
	We are analyzing the treadssurveillance footage and so on and
	so forth.
	STRICKLAND
	No one needs to know- We have
	twenty-four hours before I bounce
	it upFLEMING
	I called it in.
	STRICKLAND
	You called it in?
	FLEMING
	The moment it happened, I
	SALLY (O.S.)
	Mr. Strickland, Sir?
	STRICKLAND
	One second, Sally. You called it
	in...
	FLEMING
	YES, SIR- I did.
	STRICKLAND
	What is it, Sally?
	SALLY
	General Hoyt is on the phone.
	GENERAL HOYT
	That thing was our Space dog,
	Strickland. You know that
	STRICKLAND
	Sir, I’m getting it back-- I can’t
	be- I don’t want to be in a
	negative frame of mind, Sir.
	GENERAL HOYT
	So you’re feeling good?
	STRICKLAND
	Absolutely, Sir- Cuh- Confident.
	GENERAL HOYT
	You don’t sound confident.
	STRICKLAND
	But I am, Sir. Feeling strong.
	Getting it back.
	GENERAL HOYT
	You can get it done. You’re gonna
	get it done. For me, Son. For me.
	WEATHER MAN 1
	ZELDA
	That’s good, you keep that up.
	Looking like you don’t know
	anything. Lord help me if they ask
	me if I do. I am not a good liar--
	Except to Brewster. Takes a lot of
	lies to keep a marriage going...
	FLEMING
	If you’ll allow me, sir? In my
	opinion, we are looking at a highlytrained group, Sir.
	I’m thinking- Conceivably- SirSpecial Forces and so on and so
	forth.
	STRICKLAND
	Red Army Special forces?
	FLEMING
	Conceivably.
	A highly-trained, well-financed,
	elite group.
	Infiltration took less than five
	minutes, Sir. Highly efficient.
	Fearless precision
	STRICKLAND
	It’s a theory. Run with it.
	FLEMING
	Yes, Sir. You won’t regret it.
	You are not the anomaly, are you?
	We are. We are what happened to youdid we not?
	Were you always alone? Did you ever
	have someone?
	Do you know what happened to you?
	‘Cause I don’t.
	I swear I don’t- I look in the
	mirror and all I recognize are my
	eyes- in the face of this old man.
	Seems like I was born both too
	early or too late for my life...
	Maybe we’re both relics.
	4:10, 4:20, 4:30
	SALLY
	Sir, General Hoyt is on the phone.
	STRICKLAND
	I know Sally. I will call him back.
	4:40.
	4:50... 4:50 again.
	STRICKLAND
	You
	You smoke out here. Because the
	camera doesn’t catch it.
	Do you move it- the camera?
	Do you always meet at the same
	time?
	DUANE
	End of lunch break.
	STRICKLAND
	Hoffstetler. Doctor Hoffstetler
	has he ever joined you?
	Confused looks- “Who?”
	GILES
	No! No! No No!! Snowflake!
	Oh dear
	ZELDA
	Holy Jesus! What are you doing
	standing there in the shadows of
	the women’s locker room??
	HOFFSTETLER
	They may be watching me- and there
	are no cameras here
	ZELDA
	For good reason- what if you caught
	us in an inconvenient moment?
	HOFFSTETLER
	I need to know that he is
	alright...
	ZELDA
	He is.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Good. When will you release him?
	ZELDA
	Soon- When the rain fills the canal
	that opens to the sea... But If you
	wanna see him- we keep him inHOFFSTETLER
	No, no- I don’t want to know where
	you keep him- I just want to know
	that he’s well...
	If you need anything.
	Release him. Soon.
	What did she say?
	ZELDA
	She said: You’re a good man, Doctor
	Hoffstetler.
	HOFFSTETLER
	My name is- Dimitri. Honored to
	meet you.
	YOLANDA
	Hey, Dummy! Phone call for you!
	GILES
	I’m fine. Don’t worry about me. I’m
	fine. I’m fine... He ate pandora
	but not the pie. He was hungry but
	not stupid. He’s a wild creature.
	We can’t expect him to be anything
	else.
	Go find him. He’s terrified. Go! Go
	find him.
	You’re lucky.
	GILES’ VOICE
	Later, Elisa would tell me that
	when she saw him there- standing
	alone, blood-stained but unburdened
	and unmarred, like nature- right
	then, she knew that he was the one
	man that would never lie to herthat would never pretend to be
	anything other than himself....
	DIALOGUE
	“Trouble your heart no more... Be
	strong through this time- for from
	the widow of your son will issue
	children, and children’s
	children...”
	GILES
	I stayed awake as long as I could
	but, well I’m not a young man, you
	know. Is he alright? You sure?
	Where are you going? Elisa? Where
	are you going?
	No. No. Kitty. No kitties. Don’t
	play with the kitties.
	That’s very nice. Thank you.
	I- uh- thank you. Beautiful gesture
	but- ah- I don’t think that’s
	sanitary. Oh- ha- ha- Good boy.
	Off. Off. Not the cats. Not the
	cats.
	I think we need to clean this
	again. Interesting fella.
	ZELDA
	Why you smiling, hon?
	Stop looking like that. What
	happened?
	Why?
	How??
	Does he? Have a-?
	Lord! Never trust a man. Pfft- Even
	if he looks flat down there...
	FLEMING
	Zelda, Elisa: Come with me.
	STRICKLAND
	If you know something about what
	transpired here last Wednesday
	night, if you saw anything out of
	the ordinary, it is your obligation
	to report it.
	Any detail- no matter how small or
	trivial it seems... Zeldelilah
	Trivial means unimportant.
	ZELDA
	I didn’t see nothing out of the
	ordinary, no- Or trivial. My feet
	were hurting too muchS
	TRICKLAND
	What about you?
	ZELDA
	Neither did she.
	STRICKLAND
	Hoffstetler- Dr. Hoffstetler- did
	either of you see him coming in or
	out of the lab?
	ZELDA
	Well, he works there- doesn’t he?
	STRICKLAND
	I mean in a different way- doing
	something different
	ZELDA
	Something trivial? No, Sir- Mmhno
	STRICKLAND
	I want you to think. People get
	loose, people pay the price.
	What am I doing?
	Interviewing the fucking help- the
	shit cleaners, the piss wipers- You
	two- Just go. Leave.
	What did she say?
	What did you say? What did she say?
	ZELDA
	I didn’t catch it. I wasn’t
	looking.
	She said “Thank you.”
	Thank you, sir
	STRICKLAND
	You know, Elisa? For a mute, you
	talk too much.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Comrades. Please, come in.
	MIHALKOV
	Your extraction papers... will be
	ready soon.
	HOFFSTETLER
	I am very grateful... Stupid as the
	American are- it won’t be long for
	them to find me.
	MIHALKOV
	Nothing to worry about.
	But I have a question, then- A
	personal question. I am a little
	curious.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Yes? Go ahead. Would you like some
	butter cake?
	BURLY RUSSIAN
	Yes. Please.
	MIHALKOV
	The asset... when you injected it,
	how did it react?
	HOFFSTETLER
	How did it--
	MIHALKOV
	React. See? In humans the poison
	works instantaneously while for
	animals there is a delayed
	reaction. I was curious...
	HOFFSTETLER
	It was instant.
	BURLY RUSSIAN
	This is very good cake. You made
	it?
	You are very good at this
	MIHALKOV
	What did you do with the corpus?
	HOFFSTETLER
	I performed an autopsy.
	Unenlightening. As Lenin said,
	there is no profit in last week's
	fish.
	MIHALKOV
	Lenin said that?
	HOFFSTETLER
	Um. Of course.
	MIHALKOV
	Perhaps. Perhaps you're
	misremembering. Wait for our call.
	Shouldn’t be much longer.
	ELAINE
	That’s a gelatine parfait.
	Parfait- it’s a French word. Means
	“perfect” You like it?
	TIMMY
	Dad- Dad- can we watch Bonanza?
	ELAINE
	Bonanza is much too violent.
	It has little pieces of celery and
	walnut. Recipe’s right out of the
	box- real convenient. They say it’s
	the future of home cooking.
	STRICKLAND
	Bonanza is not violent. It’s real
	life. The way it was.
	The way it is. A man faces a
	problem. It’s up to him to solve
	it.
	ELAINE
	You know what I was thinking today?
	We get settled maybe we could get
	the kids a p-u-p-p-y.
	ELAINE
	We can go to the park- Do something
	together?
	STRICKLAND
	Puppy becomes a dog. Dog’s a wild
	animal We never “domesticated” the
	damn things--
	ELAINE
	Language, Richard. Little pitchers
	have big ears...
	STRICKLAND
	They never learn their place.
	Rover, Lassie, Spot... They’re
	carnivores. We never strip them of
	their nature... They’ll eat your
	hand as soon as they’ll take a shit
	in your yard.
	ELAINE
	Richard!
	STRICKLAND
	Don’t reconnect it. Don’t answer
	it.
	GILES
	Well, Oh, well- Hello!
	MR. ARZOUMANIAN
	What is going on? I’ve got water
	pouring into the bible movie. I
	have four paying customers. I can’t
	afford a refund.
	GILES
	It’s a pipe. It’s a pipe. I’ll take
	care of it. I’ll fix it.
	MR. ARZOUMANIAN
	I can’t have water pouring into the
	goddamn bible movie.
	GILES
	Alright. I’ll take care of it.
	Elisa! Elisa!
	GILES
	Oh, God- Elisa?
	GILES
	I’m toweling my hair, Elisa. My
	hair. And- and- look at the arm:
	healed. As if nothing had
	happened... You said he was a god.
	I don’t know. He ate a cat...
	You know what this means? We have
	to keep him around- just a little
	bit longer. You don’t want to lose
	him, do you?
	We cannot just- let him go- like
	that- We gotta keep him.
	HOFFSTETLER
	You wanted to see me?
	STRICKLAND
	Transcribe it, Sally.
	SALLY
	Right away, Sir.
	STRICKLAND
	Come on up- I have a few questions
	for you.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Of course.
	Thank you.
	STRICKLAND
	Have a seat.
	HOFFSTETLER
	How’s it going? The investigation.
	STRICKLAND
	Well- we have a promising lead.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Really? That’s good to hear.
	STRICKLAND
	You joined us in Galveston. But
	where were you before, Hoffstetler?
	Where did you come to us from
	HOFFSTETLER
	Doctor.
	STRICKLAND
	Excuse me?
	HOFFSTETLER
	Doctor Hoffstetler. Protocol.
	Wisconsin. Madison.
	STRICKLAND
	That’s right- You gave up a tenure
	track position. Didn’t ya? Gave it
	all up for us.
	HOFFSTETLER
	I did.
	STRICKLAND
	I suppose you’re getting ready to
	leave us now, then
	HOFFSTETLER
	Only if the creature isn’t found.
	STRICKLAND
	What do you think? You think we
	will-? Find it?
	HOFFSTETLER
	Well, you said you had a lead.
	STRICKLAND
	I do.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Hello?
	MIHALKOV’S VOICE
	Extraction is ready. Same place,
	Forty-eight hours.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Forty eight hours???
	SALLY
	Sir, General Hoyt.
	STRICKLAND
	Tell him I’m not in, tell him I
	will call him back. Don’t put him
	through
	SALLY
	No, Sir- he’s in your office.
	STRICKLAND
	I believe I have identified the
	mole. I will confirm and act on it.
	GENERAL HOYT
	At this point our only concern is
	the asset. Do you have it?
	STRICKLAND
	Still in the wind, sirGENERAL HOYT
	That won’t do. You’ll have to fix
	it.
	STRICKLAND
	Yes, Sir. I know. But- May I ask
	one question, Sir?
	GENERAL HOYT
	This wouldn’t be the appropriate
	time, I don’t think.
	STRICKLAND
	I need to ask, Sir- respectfully.
	GENERAL HOYT
	Then go ahead, Son.
	STRICKLAND
	You’ve know me for- how long?
	GENERAL HOYT
	Thirteen years. Battle of Pusan.
	STRICKLAND
	Yes, Sir- and in all that time, I,
	I’ve never once-
	This is- what happened here is- A
	man is faithful, Sir- loyal,
	efficient all of his life. All of
	it- and he is- useful. And he
	expects- He has certain
	expectations in return. And he
	fails, then- once. Only once. What
	does that make him? Does that make
	him a failure?
	When is a man done? Proving
	himself, Sir? A good man. A decent
	man
	GENERAL HOYT
	Decent?
	A man has the decency not to fuck
	up- that’s one thing. That is real
	decent of him. The other kind of
	decency-? It doesn’t really matter.
	We sell it- Sure- But it’s an
	export. And we sell it ‘cause we
	don’t use it.
	See? Thirty six hours from nowthis entire episode will be over.
	And so will you...
	Our universe will have a hole in it
	with your outline. And you will
	have gone on to an alternate
	universe. A universe of shit. You
	will be lost to civilization. You
	will be unborn. Unmade. Undone.
	So- go get some real decency, Son.
	And unfuck this mess.
	STRICKLAND
	Thirty-six hours. Deliver. You
	deliver. That’s what you do. You
	deliver. You don’t fail
	ELISA
	You'll never know just how much
	I’ve loved you... You'll never know
	just how much I care...
	And if I tried, I still couldn't
	hide my love for you... You ought
	to know, for haven't I told you
	so... A million or more times
	You went away and my heart went
	with you I speak your name in my
	every prayer...
	If there is some other way to prove
	That I love you, I swear I don't
	know how...
	You'll never know if you don't know
	now...
	ZELDA
	Elisa. What is it, honey?
	ZELDA
	Oh- No, Honey, no- He doesn’t look
	too good.
	This is bad. I’m going to call
	Hoffstetler...
	ZELDA
	When I was a little girl- I found a
	turtle sitting out in the middle of
	the road. Crossing it slowly. Car
	could run it over any minute.
	So, I picked it up, took it to a
	pond way back behind my house...
	and I laid it down under a big
	camphor tree, and I thought...
	“Mmmh- It’s gonna be so happy
	here”. And I left it there.
	But that night I figured out I had
	no idea where it was going... Far
	as I know it was bringing food to
	its nest or- looking to porcreateor escaping an owl. And maybe the
	worst place to keep it- maybe the
	place it was running from was that
	pond under that camphor tree.
	I didn’t care. I just did what I
	wanted with it...
	GILES
	You love him, Honey- We know what
	to do... Let him go...
	FLEMING
	Sir- If you don’t mind me saying
	so: You don’t look too well.
	STRICKLAND
	Shut up...
	FLEMING
	Sir- do you smell that? I- I think
	is it your fingers... They’re
	black, Sir
	STRICKLAND
	There he is- Doctor fucking shitbird.
	FLEMING
	There’s no call for cursing, Sir
	STRICKLAND
	Get out of the car. I’m taking it.
	FLEMING
	My car?
	STRICKLAND
	Get the fuck out.
	FLEMING
	Out of my car?
	STRICKLAND
	Did I stutter?
	FLEMING
	No. Not doing it.
	STRICKLAND
	Come again?
	FLEMING
	No- no- That’s it, see? You are- a
	very imposing man but-
	We must file- file this. Get
	clearance. Call it up- I’ve been
	doing surveillance. Unauthorized
	surveillance for you- I’m not
	clocking extra time I
	But I draw the line here. Enough is
	enough is enough. We go back. File
	the forms and let central know what
	you’re doing. We get an
	administrative package and allocate
	resources. Then- but not until thenyou can take my car or any car you
	need.
	STRICKLAND
	You never shut up.
	Silence. I just want silence.
	HOFFSTETLER
	It’s raining like hell, isn’t it-?
	He-he- No password today?
	No-no- comrade- no- please
	Strickland, thank God!
	STRICKLAND
	You were speaking Russian, Bob.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Augggh- What are you doing? I need
	to go to a hospital. I’m bleeding
	STRICKLAND
	What’s your name? Your real name.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Strickland- you know me- I’m Robert
	Hoffstetler
	STRICKLAND
	Don’t lie. You don’t need to.
	Bullet went through your gut. Shit
	is mixing with your blood right nowpoisoning it. Blood and shit. Can
	you imagine? You’re dead.
	HOFFSTETLER
	They’ll find me.
	STRICKLAND
	Who? The same people that tried to
	kill you just now? Come on “Bob”
	You work for a government... you
	know they don’t give a fuck about
	you or me
	HOFFSTETLER
	Augh- no- Please- listen to me.
	STRICKLAND
	I’m gonna need the names, ranks and
	location of the entire strike team.
	HOFFSTETLER
	Strike team?
	STRICKLAND
	The ones that took the asset.
	This candy. It’s cheap candy. I
	love it since I was a kid. Some
	favor more sophisticated snacksNougat center and all that fu-fu
	shit. But not me, Bob. This is it
	for me.
	Sometimes, if Im feeling anxious, I
	just bite right into it- chew it to
	pieces. But-
	-most of the time- I just take my
	time. I make it last.
	Names, ranks and location of the
	entire strike team.
	Names! Ranks! Now!
	HOFFSTETLER
	No names, no ranks, they...
	They just clean...
	STRICKLAND
	Piss Wipers... Shit cleaners
	HOFFSTETLER
	I'm not one of those who left their
	land... To the mercy of the enemy.
	I was deaf to their gross flattery.
	I won't grant them my songs...
	ZELDA
	Alright Brewster. I’m gonna fix you
	dinner and then I’m going to run
	out for a little while and help a
	friend.
	BREWSTER
	Help with what?
	ZELDA
	Helping a friend.
	BREWSTER
	Zelda. Door.
	ZELDA
	Well- You could well help me answer
	the door, Brewster! You’re laying
	there- not ten feet away.
	BREWSTER
	My back is acting up, woman.
	ZELDA
	Your back. Your back. Always your
	back.
	Mr. Strickland, what--
	What are you doing here--?
	STRICKLAND
	Where is it? Where did you take it?
	ZELDA
	What are you talking about?
	STRICKLAND
	The thing in the lab. Where is it?
	ZELDA
	I’m sorry, Mr. Strickland, if I
	knew anything I would surely tell
	you, but--
	STRICKLAND
	Would you? Perhaps you would, if
	you knew exactly what was at stake.
	If you knew that all can be taken
	from you- if you were to - out of
	some misplaced loyalty to a
	traitorous friend - be untruthful.
	That story about Samson. I never
	told you how it ends...
	After the Philistines- torture him
	and blind him- Samson asks God for
	the strength he needs- and at the
	last minute- he is spared. For
	Samson is a good man and a man of
	principle and the Lord gives his
	strength back to him. One last
	time.
	And he holds the columns of the
	temple with his powerful arms and
	crushes them- and he brings the
	whole building down on the
	Philistines.
	He kills them all. He dies. But he
	gets every single one of them
	motherfuckers. That is his will.
	That’s how powerful his will is.
	Now, do you know what that story
	means? For us, Delilah?
	It means that if you know something
	you’re not telling me, you will
	tell me. Either before or after I
	bring this particular temple down
	upon our heads. I am, for the time
	being, the true plight of the
	Negro, Zeldelilah...
	BREWSTER
	Gal done stole that thing right out
	the lab! Whatever it is! I hear
	them talking and talking and I have
	made my mind about it!!
	Mute girl took it. She’s who you
	want to interminate.
	STRICKLAND
	Thank you very much, Mr. Fuller for
	your assistance.
	BREWSTER
	Don’t say nothin’ of it.
	ZELDA
	What have you done--?
	I have to warn her. He’s going
	after her--
	BREWSTER
	You will not do such a thing,
	Woman. I just saved your life. Why
	you worry about her? Bitch deserves
	to be gone after, she broke the
	law
	ZELDA
	Shut up, Brewster! Shut up! For
	years- You don’t talk and now you
	can’t shut your mouth up. Damn you
	Brewster! You wouldn’t understand.
	You couldn’t understand. Not if you
	tried your whole life- She loves
	him.
	She loves him
	Giles, that you? Put Elisa on.
	Elisa, honey, you gotta listen to
	me, make a sound in the phone if
	you can hear... good. He’s coming
	for you. You got to go now and take
	that thing with you. Give the phone
	back to Giles...
	GILES
	What is it?
	STRICKLAND
	Dammit.
	They’re at the docks, Sally. Send
	back up and a containment unit. We
	will get them.
	GILES
	Come on. We have to go. Come on.
	STRICKLAND
	Fuck- you are a God.
	ZELDA
	They’re together, aren’t they?
	GILES
	Yes. I believe they are...
	GILES / NARRATOR
	If I told you about it- What would
	I Say? That they lived happily ever
	after? I believe they did... That
	they were in love- that they
	remained in love? I’m sure that is
	true...
	GILES / NARRATOR
	But when I think of her, of Elisa all that comes to mind is a poem.
	Made of just a few truthful
	words... Whispered by someone in
	love, hundreds of years ago...
	“Unable to perceive the shape of
	You, I find You all around me. Your
	presence fills my eyes with Your
	love, It humbles my heart, For You
	are everywhere.”
