GEORGES
Got you at last, my little thief.
Quick, empty your pockets!
HUGO
You’re hurting me!
GEORGES
Empty your pockets or I’ll call the
Station Inspector! Do as I say!
GEORGES
And the other one.
HUGO
There’s nothing in it!
GEORGES
Where’s the Station Inspector...?!
Ghosts...
Did you draw these pictures?!
Did you draw these pictures?!
Where did you steal this?!
HUGO
I didn’t steal it!
GEORGES
A thief and a liar.
Get out of my sight.
HUGO
Give me my notebook!
GEORGES
It is no longer your notebook, it
is my notebook and I’ll do with it
what I want. Maybe I’ll just burn
it.
HUGO
No!
GEORGES
Then tell me who did the drawings.
GET OUT OF HERE, YOU LITTLE THIEF!
INSPECTOR
Maximilian? ... What do you hear?
... Do you hear ... malfeasance?!
INSPECTOR
GO!
INSPECTOR
Stop THAT CHILD! -- APPREHEND!
GEORGES
I know you’re there ... What’s your
name, boy?
HUGO
Hugo ... Hugo Cabret.
GEORGES
Stay away from me, Hugo Cabret, or
I’ll drag you to the Station
Inspector’s office and he’ll lock
you up in his little cell and
you’ll never get out and you’ll
never go to school and you’ll never
get married and have children of
your own to take things that don’t
belong to them.
HUGO
Give me back my notebook.
GEORGES
I am going home to burn your
notebook.
HUGO
You can’t burn my notebook.
GEORGES
And who’s to stop me?
ISABELLE
Who are you?
HUGO
Your grandfather stole my notebook.
I need to get it back before he
burns it.
ISABELLE
Papa Georges isn’t my grandfather
and he isn’t a thief! He told me
all about you, young gentleman.
You’re nothing but a ... a
reprobate!
HUGO
Can you help me get inside?
ISABELLE
No. You have to go.
HUGO
Not without my notebook--
ISABELLE
Why do you need it so badly?
HUGO
I ... I can’t tell you.
ISABELLE
Is it a secret?!
HUGO
Yes.
ISABELLE
Good! I love secrets! Tell me this
instant!
HUGO
No!
ISABELLE
If you won’t tell me you have to
go.
HUGO
Not without--
ISABELLE
I’ll get in trouble. Just go home!
He won’t budge.
All right! I’ll make sure he
doesn’t burn your notebook.
ISABELLE
Trust me.
HUGO 
What is it...?
FATHER 
It’s called an Automaton.
HUGO
An Automaton...
FATHER
I found him abandoned in the attic
of the museum.
HUGO
What does he do?
FATHER
He’s a windup figure, like a music
box ... This is the most
complicated one I’ve ever seen by
far. You see? This one can write.
HUGO
Who built him?
FATHER
I would think a magician.
HUGO
A magician!
FATHER
That’s right. Magicians used
machines like this when I was a
boy. No one could figure out how
they danced or walked or sang.
But the secret was always in the
clockwork.
HUGO
Can we fix it?!
FATHER
Oh, I don’t know, Hugo, it’s
awfully rusted and finding the
parts would be...
FATHER
Of course we can fix it! We’re
clock makers, aren’t we! ... But
only when I’ve gotten through all
my work at the shop and at the
museum, you understand?
HUGO
I fixed the gears in the--
But it is not his father.
HUGO
Uncle Claude...?
CLAUDE
There was a fire. Your father’s
dead. Pack your things quickly.
You’re coming with me.
You’ll be my apprentice. You’ll
live with me and I’ll show you how
to take care of them clocks.
I’m getting too old to be climbing
through them tunnels.
CLAUDE
They built these apartments for
them who ran the station, years
ago. Everyone’s forgotten they’re
here. You sleep in the corner.
Get some sleep. We start work at
five.
HUGO
What about school?
CLAUDE
You’re finished with school. There
won’t be time for that once you’re
in them walls ... You should thank
me.
INSPECTOR
What is it?
We shall be alert, my friend ... We
shall be ... vigilant.
GEORGES
I thought I might see you today.
HUGO
I need my notebook.
GEORGES
Why do you need it so badly?
HUGO
To help me ... fix something.
GEORGES
What?
Go away ... Please just go away.
ISABELLE
Hey!
HUGO
Sorry -- I--
ISABELLE
I saw. Are you crying?
HUGO
No!
ISABELLE
Hold still.
There’s nothing wrong with crying.
Sidney Carton cries. And Heathcliff
too. In books they’re crying all
the time.
HUGO
I can do it!
ISABELLE
I have to talk to you. It’s
terribly important. But not here.
We’re too ... exposed.
HUGO
Where are we going?
ISABELLE
Only to the most wonderful place on
earth! Neverland and Oz and
Treasure Island all wrapped up into
one.
Good morning, Monsieur Rouleau.
ROULEAU
Morning.
ISABELLE
Oh, it’s coming along marvelously!
HUGO
What is it?
ROULEAU
It’s the station ... How I see it
anyway ... Do you like it?
HUGO
You know, I think I do ... Yes, I
like it very much.
ISABELLE
We have to go ... Well done,
Monsieur Rouleau!
ISABELLE
He’s a Surrealist.
HUGO
Mm.
ISABELLE
That’s a kind of painter.
HUGO
I know what a Surrealist is. I’m
not an idiot.
ISABELLE
Ah, here we are!
Good morning, Monsieur Labisse, may
I present Monsieur Hugo Cabret, a
very old and dear boon companion.
LABISSE
Monsieur Cabret.
HUGO
Hello.
ISABELLE
Thank you for this. I think I’m
halfway in love with David
Copperfield ... Photography?
LABISSE
Back corner left, top shelf.
ISABELLE
Thank you.
HUGO
Listen, what’s so important?
ISABELLE
Papa Georges still has your
notebook. He didn’t burn it. That
was all a trick.
HUGO
Why?
ISABELLE
I don’t know. The notebook made him
very upset. He and Mama Jeanne
stayed up late talking about it. I
think he was crying.
HUGO
It’s a mystery.
ISABELLE
I know!
HUGO
Why are you helping me?
ISABELLE
Because this might be an adventure!
I’ve never had one, outside of
books.
I think we should be very ...
clandestine.
HUGO
Okay.
ISABELLE
By the way, my name’s Isabelle ...
Do you want a book? Monsieur
Labisse lets me borrow them. I
could get one for you.
HUGO
No.
ISABELLE
Don’t you like books?!
HUGO
No, I do ... My father and I used
to read Jules Verne together...
ISABELLE
May I?
LABISSE
Of course. Good day, Isabelle.
HUGO
How do I get my notebook back?
ISABELLE
I think you should stand up to him.
He’ll respect that ... Don’t tell
him we talked. I’ll help you if I
can ... Be steadfast!
HUGO
I don’t believe you burned my
notebook.
GEORGES
You don’t? ... Well, maybe I did
and maybe I didn’t. You’ll never
know, will you?
Shall I call the Station Inspector?
Go ... away.
Fix it.
I said, fix it.
HUGO
I need my tools.
GEORGES
I know you’ve been stealing parts
from the shop ... Might as well use
those you haven’t stolen yet.
HUGO
If I fix it, do I get my notebook?
GEORGES
We’ll see.
HUGO
Give me my notebook.
GEORGES
You’ve got a bit of talent. But
you’ll have to prove there’s more
to you than being a thief ... You
can earn your notebook.
HUGO
How?
GEORGES
Come to the booth everyday. I’ll
decide how long you must work for
each item you stole, and it will be
up to me to decide when you have
earned your notebook, if ever.
HUGO
I already have a job.
GEORGES
Thief is not a job, boy.
HUGO
I have another job, but I’ll come
when I can.
GEORGES
You begin tomorrow. Go away.
HUGO
I’ll begin now.
INSPECTOR
Where are you parents?! Answer me!
KID
Got none.
INSPECTOR
... yes, another one. Useless waste
of an orphan by the looks of it.
Come get it.
ISABELLE
... I’m still looking for your
notebook. I have to be very
circumspect.
HUGO
You better not look inside.
ISABELLE
If I find it I should be able to
look inside it.
HUGO
Then don’t look for it!
ISABELLE
I’m trying to help. Why are you
being so mean?
HUGO
Just ... Promise me you won’t open
it.
ISABELLE
Fine.
HUGO
I saw this movie! With Douglas
Fairbanks. Did you see that?
ISABELLE
I’ve never seen a movie.
HUGO
What?!
ISABELLE
Isn’t it appalling?!
HUGO
You’ve never seen a movie? Not
ever?
ISABELLE
Papa Georges won’t let me. He’s
very strict about it.
HUGO
I love movies! My father always
took me for my birthday.
ISABELLE
Is your father dead?
HUGO
I don’t want to talk about it.
Isabelle ... Do you want to have an
adventure?
ISABELLE
We could get into trouble.
HUGO
That’s how you know it’s an
adventure.
MANAGER
How did you two rats get in here?!
And I better not see you in here
again!
HUGO
Why doesn’t Papa Georges let you go
to the movies?
ISABELLE
I don’t know. He never said. I bet
my parents would have let me. I’m
sure they were very aesthetic.
HUGO
What happened to them?
ISABELLE
They died when I was a baby. Papa
Georges and Mama Jeanne are my
godparents, so they took me in.
They’re very nice about most
everything, except the movies.
HUGO
My father took me to the movies all
the time. We saw Tom Mix and Lon
Chaney. But Douglas Fairbanks was
my favorite.
ISABELLE
What was he like?
HUGO
He loved the movies ... Ever since
he was a kid and the movies were
new. He told me about the first one
he ever saw. He went into a dark
room and on a white screen he saw a
rocket fly into the eye of the man
in the moon.
He said it was like seeing his
dreams in the middle of the day.
The movies were our special place.
It was just us ... We’d go in and
watch something ... and for a
little while we didn’t miss my mom
so much.
ISABELLE
You think about him a lot.
HUGO
All the time.
ISABELLE
Who looks after you?
HUGO
My uncle was supposed to ... But he
started going away a lot. Drinking.
Staying out all night ... One day
he didn’t come back.
ISABELLE
So you’re all alone?
HUGO
Not completely.
ISABELLE
Hugo ... Where do you live?
HUGO
There.
... My uncle taught me how to run
the clocks. So I just keep on doing
it ... Maybe he’ll come back one
day, but I doubt it.
ISABELLE
But ... Aren’t you afraid someone
will find out?
HUGO
Not as long as the clocks keep on
working and no one sees me.
ISABELLE
What do you do for money?
HUGO
Don’t need any.
ISABELLE
Can I see it?
HUGO
What?
ISABELLE
Where you live! In the walls.
HUGO
Maybe.
ISABELLE
Maybe?
HUGO
Act natural.
ISABELLE
What?
HUGO
Just keep walking. Act natural.
ISABELLE
How am I acting now?
INSPECTOR
Hey! You two.
Come ... here.
ISABELLE
Good day, Monsieur!
INSPECTOR
Where are your parents?
ISABELLE
I work with my Papa Georges at the
Toy Booth, surely you’ve seen me
there. And this is my cousin from
the country, Hugo.
You’ll have to forgive him, he’s a
little simple-minded. Doltish,
really. Poor thing.
INSPECTOR
It seems Maximilian disapproves of
you, little creature ... Why would
he disapprove of you?
HUGO
I ... don’t know...
ISABELLE
Perhaps he smells my cat?!
Christina Rossetti’s her name,
after the poetess! Would you like
me to recite? “My heart is like a
singing bird /Whose nest is in a
watered shoot--!”
INSPECTOR
All right, all right ... Go on then
... But remember, in my terminal
children are not permitted to run
amok ... Not ever.
HUGO
Doltish?
ISABELLE
It worked didn’t it?
ISABELLE
Now since I just saved your life
how about letting me see your
covert lair?
HUGO
My what?
ISABELLE
Where you live in the walls!
HUGO
I can’t understand what you’re
saying half the time.
ISABELLE
That’s because I am so gigantically
literate.
HUGO
I’ll tell you what ... I’ll let you
see my “covert lair” if you do one
thing...
ISABELLE
What’s that?
HUGO
You have to...
ISABELLE
Yes...?
HUGO
Catch me!
Where did you get that?!
ISABELLE
None of your business.
HUGO
I need it.
ISABELLE
What for?
HUGO
I just need it.
ISABELLE
Not unless you tell me why.
This is marvelous! ... I feel like
Jean Valjean!
HUGO
I used to imagine I was the Phantom
of the Opera. Like in the movie.
ISABELLE
It was a book too. You know
sometimes things are books before
they’re movies!
Oh, this is superlative!
What is it?
HUGO
It’s an automaton ... My father was
fixing it before he died.
ISABELLE
Why would my key fit your father’s
machine? ... That doesn’t make any
sense.
ISABELLE
He looks sad.
HUGO
I think he’s just waiting.
ISABELLE
For what?
HUGO
To work again. To do what he’s
supposed to do.
ISABELLE
What happens when you wind him up?
HUGO
I don’t know.
ISABELLE
What’s the matter?
HUGO
I know it’s silly but ... I think
it’s going to be a message from my
father.
ISABELLE
Do you want me to go?
HUGO
What an idiot -- Thinking I could
fix it--
ISABELLE
Hugo--
HUGO
It’s broken. It’ll always be
broken!
ISABELLE
Hugo ... You can still--
HUGO
You don’t understand. I thought if
I could fix it ... I wouldn’t be so
alone.
ISABELLE
Hugo ... Hugo, look -- look!
ISABELLE
It’s not done! It’s not done!
HUGO
It’s not writing ... It’s drawing!
ISABELLE
“Georges Melies” ... That’s Papa
Georges’ name! Why did your
father’s machine sign Papa Georges’
name?
HUGO
I don’t know...
ISABELLE
And why does my key fit it?
HUGO
Thank you.
He turns to her.
It was a message from my father ...
Now we have to figure it out.
ISABELLE
Come on.
MAMA
Isabelle...?
ISABELLE
Mama Jeanne, we have to talk to you
... This is Hugo Cabret.
HUGO
Good evening, ma’am.
MAMA
Very good manners for a thief.
HUGO
I’m not a thief.
MAMA
What’s going on, Isabelle?
ISABELLE
Oh, well, it’s a terribly long
story, filled with circumlocutions!
It all began several weeks ago when
I was...
HUGO
Wait.
MAMA
Children ... What have you done?
ISABELLE
Mama Jeanne...?
MAMA
Where did you get it?
HUGO
You’ll call me a liar.
MAMA
No, child.
HUGO
A mechanical man drew it.
MAMA
You have him?
HUGO
My father found him in a museum. No
one wanted him. We fixed him.
MAMA
But it needed ...
My key.
MAMA
The key I gave you...
MAMA
Please, take it away. We can’t
dredge up the past now. And
whatever happens, don’t let Papa
Georges see it.
HUGO
Please tell us what’s going on!
MAMA
It’s no business of yours. You must
forget all this.
HUGO
We worked hard to fix it, my father
and me, and ... it’s all I have
left of him ... I need to know what
it means.
MAMA
There are things you are too young
to understand ... You should not
yet know such sadness.
ISABELLE
It’s Papa Georges!
MAMA
He can’t know you’re here. This
way...
Just keep quiet. I’ll find a way to
get him out of the apartment. Not a
noise from either of you.
HUGO
She looked at the armoire.
ISABELLE
I already searched it when I was
looking for your notebook.
HUGO
I’ll look again. You stand guard!
ISABELLE
Splendid!
HUGO
Look!
ISABELLE
We have to investigate!
ISABELLE
Let me, I’m taller.
GEORGES
Back from the dead ...
MAMA
Stop it, Georges! Stop! This is
your work!
GEORGES
My work?! -- What am I? Nothing but
a penniless merchant! A broken
windup toy!
I trusted you -- and this is how
you thank me?! You cruel -- cruel--
An empty box, an old rocket, a lost
monster ... nothing, nothing,
nothing...
MAMA
I’m sorry, Georges ... I’m so
sorry...
ISABELLE
I should go back.
HUGO
Okay.
ISABELLE
I’ve never seen him cry before.
Thank you for the movie today ...
It was a gift.
HUGO
Oh, I’m sorry, sir!
LABISSE
You know that volume?
HUGO
I used to read it with my father...
LABISSE
Hm ... It was intended for my
godson.
But now I think it is intended for
you.
Monsieur Cabret.
ROULEAU
Things aren’t always what they
seem.
HUGO
Why would he give it to me?
ROULEAU
Because you needed it.
HUGO
I recognize the clock. But it’s
different.
ROULEAU
Sitting here, day after day, I
watch things. I watch them change
in the light. A clock becomes a
wheel becomes a train becomes a
rocket becomes a robot ... It’s
like a story.
HUGO
How does it end?
ROULEAU
I don’t know. The story’s not over
yet.
ROULEAU
But it’ll be surprising.
HUGO
Because things aren’t always what
they seem?
ROULEAU
Well, look around you ... Not all
clocks run forever ... not all
little boys live in houses ... and
not all messages are written on
paper.
ROULEAU
Quick, behind the canvas!
INSPECTOR
Monsieur Artiste. How goes the
painting? May I look?
ROULEAU
Not ready yet. Soon ... Things must
happen at the opportune moment.
INSPECTOR
If we only knew when that moment
was...
ROULEAU
For the heart, there is only now,
my friend.
INSPECTOR
Do you think?
ROULEAU
Of course! Go say hello to her ...
ROULEAU
Ahh ... Radiant!
HUGO
Thank you, sir ... Your painting is
going to be magnificent.
ROULEAU
So is yours.
INSPECTOR
Mademoiselle Lisette, a very
gracious good evening to you.
LISETTE
Monsieur Inspector.
INSPECTOR
Hm. Yes ... Those are lovely posies
there.
LISETTE
They’re from Gourdon. They come in
on the overnight train.
INSPECTOR
Ah, Gourdon. Splendid country that.
All the ... cows and such ... Do
they have a smell?
You see I was injured in the war.
It will never heal ... Good evening
to you, Mademoiselle.
LISETTE
I lost my brother.
INSPECTOR
Where?
LISETTE
Verdun.
Good evening, Monsieur Inspector.
INSPECTOR
Good evening, Mademoiselle Lisette.
ISABELLE
Excuse me, Madame--
Excuse me, we would like to use the
library.
RECEPTIONIST
No.
ISABELLE
No?
RECEPTIONIST
You’re too small and too dirty.
Goodbye.
HUGO
Excuse me. I thought the library
was open to all Frenchmen.
RECEPTIONIST
Not small and dirty ones.
HUGO
In that case ...
I would like to see your superior.
RECEPTIONIST
What kind of dreadful little
Jacobin are you?
HUGO
The kind that wants to use the
library.
Excuse me, sir, we’re looking for a
book about very early movies.
STUDENT
Rene Tabard. THE INVENTION OF
DREAMS. Row Four. Section Three.
Top shelf.
ISABELLE
Much obliged. What are you reading?
HUGO 
“In 1895, one of the very first
films ever shown was called A TRAIN
arrive IN THE STATION, which
showed nothing more than a train
coming into a station...”
ISABELLE 
“But when the train came speeding
toward the screen, the audience
screamed because they thought they
were in danger of being run over.
No one had ever seen anything like
it before.”
HUGO
No one had ever seen anything like
it before.
“What began as a sideshow novelty
soon grew into something more as
the first filmmakers discovered
they could use the new medium to
tell stories...”
ISABELLE
“The filmmaker Georges Melies was
among the first to realized that
film had the power to capture
dreams...”
HUGO
“This great pioneer of early cinema
died during the Great War--”
ISABELLE
Died...?
HUGO
“Died during the Great War.”
TABARD
You’re interested in Melies?
HUGO
Yes, uh--
ISABELLE
It’s allowed.
TABARD
Is it?
Come with me.
Here he is at work in his studio
... And this is a handbill
advertising his stage act ... And
this is one of his actual cameras!
ISABELLE
Why do you have all this?
TABARD
Your godfather is a passion of
mine. He was a great filmmaker.
HUGO
He was a magician?
TABARD
Yes, he began on the stage.
ISABELLE
How did he start making movies?
TABARD
No one really knows.
HUGO
Look how happy he is...
ISABELLE
Professor Tabard ... Would you like
to meet him?
TABARD
Oh, but you see, I have met him.
My brother worked as a carpenter
building sets for Melies. One day
he took me to visit the studio...
We see what Young Tabard has been gazing at:
It was like something out of a
dream. The whole building was made
of glass ... In reality this was to
let in all the sunlight necessary
for filming, but to my eyes it was
nothing short of an enchanted
castle ... a palace made of
glass...
GEORGES
If you’ve ever wondered where your
dreams come from, just look around.
This is where they’re made.
TECHNICIAN
Think we got it.
GEORGES
Very good ... But we need to change
the scene...
GEORGES
We need to add one ... more ...
knight.
TABARD
In the end, he made over 500 movies
... He was phenomenally popular in
his day.
ISABELLE
But why did he stop?
TABARD
Up until today, I believed that he
died in the war, like so many
others.
HUGO
Can we watch some of his movies?
TABARD
I wish you could ... But time
hasn’t been kind to old movies...
This is the only one that we know
of that survived ... Out of
hundreds ... One.
And still ... it is a masterpiece.
HUGO
... I think it’s the only way.
He’ll be excited. Why wouldn’t he
be?
ISABELLE
Do you think I should tell Mama
Jeanne?
HUGO
No, it has to be a surprise, like a
magic trick. We have to have some
... panache.
ISABELLE
Well done.
HUGO
Shhh!
INSPECTOR
Monsieur Claude? Are you up there?
... Monsieur Claude?
HUGO
Monsieur?
INSPECTOR
Is all well up there?
HUGO
Yes, sir.
INSPECTOR
You’re not ... inebriated, are you?
HUGO
No, sir ... I have a sore throat.
INSPECTOR
Hmm. Well, be sure to check the
clock on platform seven. By my
calculation it is three minutes
fast ... I will not have time
running amok in my station.
HUGO
Right away, sir.
... It’s the only way we’ll find
out everything ... Papa Georges
will see that there are people who
remember him. How can that be
wrong?
ISABELLE
I don’t know...
HUGO
Please, Isabelle ... My father, the
Automaton, Papa Georges, it’s like
a puzzle ... When we put it all
together, something’s going to
happen.
ISABELLE
A message from your father?
HUGO
Maybe.
ISABELLE
I just hope ... you won’t be
disappointed.
ISABELLE
Poor Monsieur Rouleau ... He works
so hard. People just don’t
understand.
HUGO
He keeps at it though. He’s got a
real ... purpose.
ISABELLE
What do you mean?
HUGO
Could you hand me that?
I mean ... Did you ever notice that
all machines are made for some
reason? They make you laugh, like
Papa Georges’ toys, or they tell
time, like the clocks ... Maybe
that’s why broken machines always
make me sad, because they can’t do
what they’re meant to do.
HUGO
Maybe it’s the same with people. If
you lose your purpose ... it’s like
you’re broken.
ISABELLE
Like Papa Georges.
HUGO
Maybe we can fix him.
ISABELLE
Is that your purpose?
HUGO
What?
ISABELLE
That. Fixing things.
HUGO
I don’t know. It’s what my father
did.
ISABELLE
I wonder what my purpose is?
HUGO
I don’t know.
ISABELLE
Maybe if I had known my parents I
would know.
HUGO
Come with me.
Right after my father died, I would
come up here a lot ... I would
imagine that the whole world was
one big machine. Machines never
have any extra parts, you know.
They always have the exact number
they need. So I figured if the
entire world was a big machine I
couldn’t be an extra part, I had to
be here for some reason ...
And that means you have to be here
for some reason, too.
I’ll bring them at seven o’clock
tomorrow night. Don’t say anything.
ISABELLE
Are you sure about this?
HUGO
Not really ... But I think it’s the
only way...
ISABELLE
To fix him.
TABARD
Good evening.
HUGO
This way, sir.
ISABELLE
I’ll get it!
Oh, what a surprise! Come in, come
in...
MAMA
What is the meaning of this,
Isabelle?
ISABELLE
Please don’t be mad.
MAMA
That young man is not welcome here.
HUGO
We found out who Papa Georges is.
TABARD
I deeply apologize, Madame. I
thought you were expecting us. I
will leave immediately and return
upon your request.
MAMA
Please, keep your voices down, my
husband is sleeping. He hasn’t been
well ... I ... I’m afraid you will
not be invited back.
ISABELLE
Don’t make them leave...
TABARD
I don’t want to impose on you,
Madame Melies, but if this is to be
the only time we meet, please let
me express to you the profound debt
of gratitude I owe your husband.
When I was boy I saw all his films.
They inspired me ... Your husband
is a very great artist.
MAMA
I’m pleased that you remember my
husband’s films with such fondness,
but he’s become so fragile ... It
only hurts him to remember the
past.
Then we will take our leave, Madame
... And I do hope you’ll forgive me
for saying, you are as lovely now
as you were in the movies.
ISABELLE
Mama Jeanne...?
HUGO
You were in the movies?
TABARD
She appeared in almost all of his
films.
ISABELLE
You were an actress?!
MAMA
That was a long time ago, children.
Another life ... I was another
person.
TABARD
Would you like to meet her again?
We have a film.
MAMA
One of Georges’ films...? But
that’s not possible. They’re all
gone.
TABARD
May we show you?
HUGO
Oh, please...
ISABELLE
Please, Mama Jeanne...
MAMA
Be quick with it.
ISABELLE
An actress! A cinema actress! It’s
impossibly romantic!
MAMA
It wasn’t like that. We weren’t
movie stars like they have now ...
But we did have fun.
TABARD
Madame Melies?
ISABELLE
Mama Jeanne ... it’s you!
MAMA
Yes...
HUGO
It’s color!
MAMA
We tinted the film ... Painted it
by hand.
ISABELLE
You were so beautiful.
GEORGES
She still is.
I would recognize the sound of a
movie projector anywhere.
MAMA
Georges ... You’ve tried to forget
the past for so long, and that’s
brought you nothing but unhappiness
... Maybe it’s time to remember.
I remember the man I fell in love
with ... I don’t want to lose him
forever.
GEORGES
You want to know?
HUGO
Yes.
GEORGES
Like you ... I loved to fix
things...
I started out as a magician, and
Mama Jeanne was my assistant. We
were very successful, I must say.
We even had our own theatre...
But I was always tinkering with
machines.
I had my own workshop at the
theatre where I could invent new
illusions ... Once I even built a
working Automaton. Ah, he was a
particular treasure. I put my heart
and soul into him...
Then one night, Mama Jeanne and I
went to visit a traveling circus.
We were walking past the sideshow
tents when I noticed something ...
Something strange ... Something
wonderful...
The Lumiere brothers had invented
the movies. I fell in love with
their invention. How could I not be
a part of it? It was like a new
kind of magic...
I asked the Lumiere brothers to
sell me a camera, but they refused.
You see they were convinced the
movies were only a passing fad and
didn’t want me to waste my money!
So I built my own camera using
leftover pieces from the
Automaton...
We risked everything ... We sold
the theatre and everything we had
so we could build our own movie
studio...
And so the great adventure began! I
wrote, designed, directed and acted
in hundreds of movies. Magic tricks
and illusion became my specialty;
the world of imagination ...
My beautiful wife was my muse, my
star, and we couldn’t have been
happier ... We thought it would
never end. How could it?
Taking us to...
But then the war came, and youth
and hope were at an end ... The
world had no time for magic tricks
and movie shows...
The returning soldiers, having seen
so much of reality, were bored by
my films ... Tastes had changed,
but I had not changed with them...
No one wanted my movies anymore.
Eventually I couldn’t pay the
actors or keep the business running
... And so my enchanted castle fell
to ruin ... Everything was lost...
One night, in bitter despair, I
burned all my old sets and costumes
... I was forced to sell my movies
to a company that melted them down
into chemicals used to make shoe
heels...
With the little money I made from
selling my films I bought the toy
booth ... And there I have
remained...
The only thing I couldn’t bring
myself to destroy was my beloved
Automaton. I gave him to a museum,
hoping he would find a home.
But they never put him on display.
And then the museum burned ... It’s
all gone now. Everything I ever
made ... Nothing but ashes and
fading strips of celluloid.
My life has taught me one lesson,
Hugo ... Not the one I thought it
would ... Happy endings only happen
in the movies.
HUGO
The story’s not over yet.
HUGO
I’ll be right back!
INSPECTOR
There has been ... a disquieting
development.
FRICK
What is it?
INSPECTOR
The man who winds the clocks,
Monsieur Claude, has been found --
deceased.
INSPECTOR
They found his body in the Seine.
He’s been down there for months it
seems. Amongst the fishes. And
such.
MADAME EMILIE
Oh dear, oh dear.
INSPECTOR
I can’t say I’m surprised this was
his mortal culmination. He was an
inebriant of the highest order.
Time and again I had to warn him
about it ... These are the wages of
sin!
FRICK
But if Monsieur Claude has been
dead for months...
INSPECTOR
Yes...?
FRICK
At the bottom of the river...
MADAME EMILIE
Yes...?
FRICK
Then who has been winding the
clocks?
HUGO 
You don’t understand -- I have to 
go! 
INSPECTOR 
You’ll go nowhere until your 
parents can be found. 
HUGO 
I don’t have any parents! 
INSPECTOR 
Then it’ll be straight to the 
orphanage with you, little vermin. 
You and your kind. Spreading 
disorder everywhere you go. WELL 
not HERE! THIS IS MY STATION, DO 
you UNDERSTAND?! -- AND I WILL HAVE 
ord! 
Yes, hello? hello? ... Connect me 
with the Orphanage Bureau. Quickly. 
I need to arrange a... 
Maximilian! 
LABISSE
Oh, do pardon me!
INSPECTOR
Must have gone the other way. Come!
Stand aside!
You demented animal! What were you
thinking?!
We’ll let the orphanage deal with
you!
HUGO
No! -- I don’t belong there!
INSPECTOR
Where do you belong then? A child
has to belong to somewhere and to
someone!
HUGO
Please ... Please listen to me ...
You have to let me go ... I don’t
understand ... why my father died 
... why I’m alone.... 
This is my only chance ... To work.
You should understand.
GEORGES
I do ... I do understand.
Monsieur ... This child belongs to
me.
HUGO
I’m sorry ... He’s broken...
GEORGES
No he’s not ... He worked
perfectly.
TABARD
Honored guests, I am proud to
welcome you to this gala
celebrating the life and work of
Georges Melies.
TABARD
For years most of his films were
thought to be lost. Indeed,
Monsieur Melies believed so
himself. But we began a search. We
looked through vaults and longforgotten archives, through private
collections, barns and catacombs.
Our work was rewarded with old
negatives, boxes of prints, and
trunks full of decaying film, which
we were able to save ... We now
have over eighty films by Georges
Melies!
And tonight their creator ... and
the newest member of the Film
Academy faculty ... is here to
share them with you.
GEORGES
Ladies and gentlemen ... I am
standing before you tonight because
of one very brave young man...
He saw a broken machine. And
against all odds, he fixed it ...
It was the kindest magic trick I
have ever seen.
Now, my friends, I address you all
tonight as you truly are: wizards,
mermaids, travelers, adventurers,
and magicians ... Come and dream
with me.
It is a cornucopia of images from a golden horn. A
phantasmagoria of...
Undersea kingdoms...
Magic tricks...
Wildly dancing devils...
Mysterious submarine journeys...
Gigantic monsters...
Beautiful damsels...
Soaring palaces...
Wondrous balloon voyages...
Knock-about slapstick...
Expanding heads...
Frolicking skeletons...
Lovely star-like angels...
And...
A trip to the moon.
ISABELLE 
Once upon a time, I met a boy named
Hugo Cabret. He lived in a train
station...
Why did he live in a train station?
You might well ask ... That’s
really what this book is going to
be about...
And about how this singular young
man searched so hard to find a
secret message from his father...
And how that message lit his way
... all the way home.
