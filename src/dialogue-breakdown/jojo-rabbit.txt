	JOJO
	Jojo Betzler, ten and a half years
	old. Today you join the ranks of the
	Jungvolk. This is a great day, for
	you, for your family, and for all of
	Germany.
	HEIL HITLER!!!
	SUPER: “VIENNA, 1944”
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler, Herr Josef!
	Heil Hitler, Frau Kirsch!
	YORKI
	Jojo!
	JOJO
	Yorki! Heil Hitler!
	YORKI
	Heil Hitler!
	JOJO
	Looking good Yorki.
	YORKI
	You too, Jojo. Did you bring your
	books?
	JOJO
	Of course. Now Yorki we must make a
	big effort this weekend. It’s rare for
	we Jungvolk to be allowed at a
	Hitlerjugend training weekend and I
	want to make a good impression. They
	may promote us to Hitler’s Special
	Guard early. Only the best of the best
	get to do that.
	YORKI
	Yes, you and I will be best of the
	best.
	JOJO
	The best Nazi’s the whole world has
	ever seen.
	CHILDREN
	I swear to devote all my energies and
	my strength to the saviour of our
	country, Adolf Hitler. I am willing
	and ready to give up my life for him,
	so help me God.
	KLENZENDORF
	Heil Hitler!
	FINKEL
	Heil Hitler!
	KLENZENDORF
	Jungvolk, welcome to our Hitlerjugend
	training weekend in which we will make
	men and women of you all. My name is
	Captain Klenzendorf - you may call me
	Captain K.
	FINKEL
	Captain K! Woohoo!
	KLENZENDORF
	...and this is Sub-Officer Finkel. You
	may only call him Sub-Officer Finkel.
	Over the next two days you will get a
	taste of the Hitlerjugend experience
	so you know what you’re in store for
	once you’re old enough to join
	yourself. You boys have all been
	issued with your Deutsches Jungvolk
	Daggers. Please take them out.
	These are very special and expensive
	weapons, you should never be without
	them. And DO NOT try to stab each
	other.
	FINKEL
	No stabbing! Or you’ll die. From blood
	loss.
	KLENZENDORF
	Now, this is your first step towards
	being men. Today you boys will be
	involved in such activities as
	marching, bayonet drills, grenade
	throwing, trench digging, map reading,
	gas defence, camouflage, making traps,
	ambush techniques, war games, firing
	guns and blowing stuff up.
	The girls will practice important
	womanly duties such as nursing wounds,
	making beds, and learning how to get
	pregnant.
	Alright, let’s get to it. Are you
	ready?!
	CHILDREN
	Yes! HEIL HITLER!!!
	FINKEL
	Move, move, move! On your feet you
	little Hitlers!
	FINKEL
	Then a happy baby comes out. Yay!
	CHILDREN
	Horns. Serpent tongue. Fangs.
	Green blood. Claws.
	FRAULEIN RAHM
	Fantastisch! Excellent work children.
	You also forgot that the Jew is the
	offspring of Satan and sucks the blood
	of Christian children for their
	mitzvah.
	By the time the inferior race catches
	up to where we are today, we’ll be way
	up here.
	It has been scientifically proven that
	we Aryans are 1000 times more advanced
	and civilised than any other race.
	Now, get your things together, it’s
	time to burn some books!
	CHILDREN
	Yayyyy!!!
	YORKI
	Is that it? Only 4 books?
	JOJO
	It’s all I could find on the list.
	Kafka... Brecht... Hesse... Burn you
	losers.
	JOJO
	Imagine being in a battle, you’ve just
	run out of ammo, all you have is your
	DJ Knife. I would take down 20 of them
	before they got me. And I’d be
	laughing when they did.
	YORKI
	I don’t like that situation. I don’t
	want to die at all.
	JOJO
	Live Faithfully, Fight Bravely, and
	Die Laughing... that’s the motto.
	6.
	YORKI
	I know but I wouldn’t be laughing. I’d
	probably be screaming.
	JOJO
	Then I’m afraid you might not be cut
	out for Hitler’s personal guard. It’s
	really hard to get chosen y’know. You
	need to have perfect vision, perfect
	teeth and you’re not allowed one ounce
	of fat.
	YORKI
	Hey, Jews sound scary, huh?
	JOJO
	Yeah, I didn’t know they stole the
	white skins of Aryans so they could
	blend in. Savages!
	YORKI
	Me neither. Thankfully most got sent
	back to their caves so it’s not likely
	that we’ll see a real one.
	JOJO
	If I did I’d kill it like that.
	YORKI
	But how would you know if you saw one?
	They can look just like us.
	JOJO
	Oh I’d know. I’d feel it’s head for
	horns. And they smell like Brussel
	Sprouts.
	YORKI
	Oh yeah, I forgot about the Brussel
	Sprouts bit.
	JOJO
	Imagine catching one and giving it to
	Hitler. That’d be a sure-fire way to
	get into his personal guard.
	YORKI
	He’d be so impressed.
	JOJO
	Then we would become best friends.
	YORKI
	I thought I was your best friend.
	JOJO
	You’re my second best friend. First
	place is reserved for someone really
	special - like the Führer. He, and
	only he can have that spot, so unless
	you’re Hitler hiding in a fat little
	boy’s body I’d be happy with 2nd
	place.
	YORKI
	I’m just a kid.
	JOJO
	Case closed.
	Night papa, I hope you come home soon.
	Night Inga, I hope you’re happy up
	there.
	HANS
	When you stand before a Roast Beef-man
	and have to end his life, which of you
	will have the stomach for it?
	There is no room in Hitler’s army for
	scared little girls and those who lack
	strength. We want hardened warriors
	who are prepared to kill at will. Can
	you do that?
	CHRISTOPH
	Johannes? Can you kill?
	JOJO
	Pff, of course. I love killing.
	CHRISTOPH
	Good...
	Kill it.
	JOJO
	Hmm?
	CHRISTOPH
	Wring its neck. Kill the rabbit.
	JOJO
	Oh, I’m ok. I might do it later.
	CHRISTOPH
	No later, NOW. Or are you scared?
	JOJO
	No, I’m not scared. I just... I’m
	allergic to fur and I don’t want itchy
	hands for the rest of the weekend.
	HANS
	Itchy hands? Kill the damn rabbit and
	be a soldier Jojo!
	JOJO
	I thought soldiers killed people, not
	bunnies.
	HANS
	You must show you have an iron stomach
	to undertake the work of eradicating
	the parasite.
	Place both hands around it’s neck and
	then one hard, twist, sometimes two,
	he might scream but drop him and we’ll
	use the boot to finish it off.
	HITLERJUGEND
	Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill.
	CHRISTOPH
	Coward. Just like your father.
	JOJO
	He’s not a coward, he’s in Italy.
	CHRISTOPH
	No one has heard from him in 2 years.
	He’s a deserting coward just like you.
	HANS
	Yes, he’s a deserter.
	JOJO
	No, he doesn’t do that, he fights.
	CHRISTOPH
	You’re as scared as a rabbit.
	HANS
	Scared little rabbit. Maybe we should
	snap your neck.
	KID
	Rabbit. Coward.
	ANOTHER KID
	Jojo rabbit.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Poor Jojo, what is wrong?
	JOJO
	Hi Adolf.
	ADOLF
	Why so down in the dumps little man? A
	strong boy like yourself shouldn’t be
	sad, you should be happy like a cloud!
	Clouds don’t care about anything!
	JOJO
	The other kids called me a coward. And
	my papa, they say he makes desserts
	instead of fighting. But I know he’s
	still fighting, for you, for me, and
	for Germany.
	ADOLF
	Oh, of course he is! And he is also
	making nice desserts, nothing wrong
	with that. My God, his custard tarts
	are the only thing keeping up morale
	at the front.
	JOJO
	Do you think he can come home soon?
	Just for a quick visit?
	ADOLF
	Well, I kinda need him for those
	special missions and whatnot. And the
	desserts are also an important factor.
	JOJO
	Really?
	ADOLF
	Mm-hm. He’s one of my top men. Now,
	want to tell me about the rabbit
	incident? What was that all about?
	JOJO
	They wanted me to kill it. I’m sorry.
	ADOLF
	Meh, don’t worry about it. I couldn’t
	care less. I’m a cloud.
	11.
	JOJO
	But now they call me a scared rabbit.
	ADOLF
	Well you want to know something?
	Just because they’re small and
	delightfully cute doesn’t mean rabbits
	are cowards. The rabbit faces a
	dangerous world everyday, hunting
	carrots for his family... for his
	country. Forget those boys. They have
	their place and so do you. My empire
	will be made up of all animals,
	eagles, lions, elephants and even
	rabbits.
	JOJO
	No thanks, I don’t sm--
	ADOLF
	But not those Egyptian horses with
	bumpy-backs. I don’t trust them.
	JOJO
	You mean camels?
	ADOLF
	Errm, I don’t think they’re called
	that.
	Remember this good advice Jojo, be the
	rabbit. The bunny can outwit all his
	enemies!
	“Camels”, ha!
	What’s in those bumps I wonder? Gold?
	More humps? Baby Camels? I guess we’ll
	never know their secrets!
	JOJO
	Be the Rabbit...
	KLENZENDORF
	Now lads, the hand-grenade is one of
	the most effective weapons in the
	German army. It can blow off a leg,
	maybe 2 legs, definitely a head. It is
	very dangerous. Just quietly, I prefer
	the rounder, egg-shaped version used
	by the British and Americans. I dunno,
	it just seems silly that our ones look
	like sticks.
	FINKEL
	Sticks... pff.
	YORKI
	Are you alright Jojo?
	JOJO
	Absolutely, I was just doing some pushups for my muscles.
	YORKI
	I thought you were crying.
	JOJO
	Nope. Push-ups.
	And don’t just assume that because
	water comes from someone’s eyes that
	they are crying, okay? Are you a teardrop specialist?
	YORKI
	No.
	JOJO
	Case closed. Now, Yorki Dorky, it’s
	time for Jojo to show these big pipsqueaks who is a coward. I mean, NOT a
	coward - me. You’ll see what I mean.
	YORKI
	Jojo! Where are you going? Don’t you
	want to watch the hand-grenades?
	KLENZENDORF
	Now you little kids stay all the way
	over there and watch the action.
	Each of you will be given the
	opportunity to arm and throw a
	grenade. ONE AT A TIME. I will
	personally be supervising each--
	JOJO
	Jojo rabbit! Jojo rabbit! Hunting
	carrots, Jojo rabbit!
	KLENZENDORF
	You! Get back here with that!!!
	JOJO
	Jojo rabbbbit!!!
	ADOLF
	Scheisse.
	JOJO
	Ooh, scheisse...
	KLENZENDORF
	It was one of those stick-shaped ones,
	not the superior oval type. Do you
	know the ones I mean?
	FINKEL
	Like this.
	KLENZENDORF
	Exactly. Anyway, luckily it was only a
	training grenade, half packed with
	explosive. A proper one would have
	blown off his leg. Maybe both.
	FINKEL
	Probably both. Or a head.
	KLENZENDORF
	Do you think I could get in trouble
	for this?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Darling Jojo, my cub... I’m taking you
	home.
	JOJO
	Hello?
	Inga, don’t scare me. Please.
	FRAU BETZLER (O.S.)
	There’s my little cub.
	In the mirror Jojo sees his mother standing at the door,
	smiling.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler, Mama!!!
	FRAU BETZLER
	Wow, a little louder nest time huh?
	Didn’t quite hear you. Hello darling.
	JOJO
	Why so happy? Your son is a monster.
	FRAU BETZLER
	No. Not a monster, you’re still my
	beautiful Jojo. Besides the doctors
	are confident you will get most of the
	movement back in your hand and you
	will also walk properly again. Neat
	huh? I’m just happy to have you back
	home.
	JOJO
	I’ll never be in Hitler’s guard, now.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Don’t try so hard to be like the
	others Jojo. You’re fine as you are.
	JOJO
	I need to be better.
	FRAU BETZLER
	You need to be you, not Mr. Uber
	German. Look, Mama Lion worries about
	her cub, that’s all. Especially when
	papa Lion isn’t here.
	JOJO
	Or Inga Lion.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Or Inga Lion.
	JOJO
	Mama, you don’t have to worry about
	me. I’m a tough guy and I will look
	after us. You wait, I’ll make you the
	proudest mother in the whole wide
	Reich.
	FRAU BETZLER
	A few more months and you’ll get it.
	Round the tree, through the rabbit
	hole, then pull.
	Now, you better get on your way, I
	told the Hitlerjugend office you were
	coming in today.
	JOJO
	I thought you didn’t want me to be
	involved with all that.
	FRAU BETZLER
	I don’t want you involved in being
	dead on some battlefield. You can’t be
	a soldier but you can still help. I
	think getting out of the house will do
	wonders for your recuperation. Come
	on, you can walk me to the food store
	first. We need supplies.
	JOJO
	I don’t want to go out there.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Don’t be silly, of course you do.
	JOJO
	But people will look at me.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Let them! Enjoy the attention, kid.
	People used to look at me.
	Oh well! Now, you’re going to pluck up
	your courage, walk out that door and
	have an adventure. Okay?
	JOJO
	Okay.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Looks like the coast is clear. Field
	Marshall Jojo, you’re our top man,
	only you can accomplish this
	mission... Good luck.
	JOJO
	Is it dangerous?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Extremely.
	FRAU BETZLER
	You have a wonderful day, cub.
	Oh, you have something on your shirt.
	JOJO
	Don’t!
	FRAU BETZLER
	What? You really do have something!
	Look!
	JOJO
	Stop it, Mama! Don’t hit me!
	FRAU BETZLER
	I’m not hitting you, you’re hitting
	yourself!
	Heyyy kid, don’t beat yourself up.
	You’re a good guy, no need for all
	this violence!
	I love you. Heil Shitler.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler!!
	The secretary and Officers jump.
	SECRETARY
	Jesus kid.
	OFFICERS
	Heil Hitler.
	SECRETARY
	What happened to you?
	JOJO
	Wounded in battle. I was blown up.
	SECRETARY
	What was it, a lipstick bomb?
	OFFICER 1
	A war hero! Well, how can we help you?
	JOJO
	Well. I am here to offer my serv--
	20.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	I know that voice...
	KLENZENDORF
	Heyyyy Johannes! Looking good.
	JOJO
	Hello Herr Klenzendorf.
	KLENZENDORF
	You remember Unteroffiziere Finkel.
	FINKEL
	Heil Hitler, little boy.
	KLENZENDORF
	Guys this is Johannes Betzler, the kid
	I told you about. Remember, he stole a
	hand grenade and blew himself up and
	as a result I was demoted for
	negligence and now have to work in
	this office.
	JOJO
	I am sorry you were demoted.
	KLENZENDORF
	Oh it’s fine. I wasn’t really
	enthusiastic about that training camp
	stuff. Little Nazis running around,
	maniacal singing and histrionics.
	Migraine hell.
	Your mother came in the other day and
	explained your situation.
	JOJO
	What did she say?
	KLENZENDORF
	Only that it’s just the two of you at
	home now, and that you wanted to help
	out here. Your father is a soldier,
	no?
	JOJO
	Yes, he is fighting with the 10th Army
	in Italy. And he makes desserts.
	KLENZENDORF
	And you had a sister.
	JOJO
	Inga. She died of influenza.
	KLENZENDORF
	I’m sorry to hear that. Well, it would
	seem you are the man of the house so
	we’ll have to keep you busy.
	Ideas guys?
	OFFICER 1
	Umm, well, I guess you could hand out
	some of this information.
	OFFICER 2
	And deliver these conscriptions.
	JOJO
	Conscripts. I don’t suppose I could
	have one of those could I? I’m
	actually in peak physical condition.
	KLENZENDORF
	Maybe later, Jojo, you’re still on the
	mend. For now you can start small.
	Conscripts and propaganda.
	JOJO
	Your wish is my command. I will
	execute my orders with precision and
	strength. Wait, what’s the difference
	between information and propaganda?
	FINKEL
	Just deliver the stuff , kid.
	JOJO
	Ja wohl!
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler, Frau Baumer!
	FRAU BAUMER
	Hmm? Oh yes, Sieg Heil.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler, Herr Koch.
	HERR KOCH
	Hmm?
	Oooh, yikes.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler, Herr Grusch.
	HERR GRUSCH
	What happened to you?
	JOJO
	War wound. I’ll probably get a medal.
	Herr Grusch, I have here a
	conscription notice for your son.
	Wait, is his name Klaus?
	HERR GRUSCH
	Yes, it is, but he already joined.
	JOJO
	Where is he?
	Oh, I’m sorry. The Führer would be
	proud.
	HERR GRUSCH
	That’s comforting.
	Klaus is also my name.
	JOJO
	But you’re...
	HERR GRUSCH
	They’re recruiting us veterans of the
	Great War now. There are no more young
	people left. This whole thing is
	becoming very flimsy. I don’t know how
	to operate a flame-thrower or antitank gun. So stupid.
	JOJO
	You are more able than I Herr Grusch.
	Everyone must do their part and that
	includes you. I hope I do not need to
	tell the authorities of your
	indolence.
	Heil Hitler!
	HERR GRUSCH
	Bye Johannes.
	JOJO
	Mama! I’m home.
	Maaaama, Field Marshall Jojo is home.
	Mama Lion?
	JOJO
	ELSA
	You come to kill me, little boy?
	JOJO
	I...
	ELSA (O.S.)
	Joooooo-jooooooo...
	JOJO
	Who are you? What do you want? Are you
	a ghost?
	ELSA
	Yesssssssssss... a ghost.
	JOJO
	Get out! Get out of my house!
	ELSA
	Johannes, that’s no way to treat a
	ghost.
	JOJO
	Why do you live upstairs in the wall?!
	ELSA
	Where else should a ghost live?
	JOJO
	Not here!
	ELSA
	Don’t make me run kid, I’m far too
	hungry and y’know how much we have a
	taste for your blood.
	You dropped something.
	I’m not a ghost Johannes, I’m
	something worse. But I think you
	already know that, don’t you? You know
	what I am.
	JOJO
	No.
	ELSA
	Yes... Say it.
	JOJO
	Jew.
	ELSA
	Wunderbar.
	JOJO
	You can’t be here.
	ELSA
	Well your mother invited me so I’m her
	guest.
	JOJO
	No. It’s not allowed.
	ELSA
	What will you do sweet Hitlerchen?
	Of course. Go on then, go and tell
	them. But you know what happens if you
	do? I’ll say you helped me, and your
	mother too. Then we’ll all be kaput.
	And if you tell your mother you know
	about me... just one word...
	I’ll do the world a great big favour
	and CUT YOUR NAZI HEAD OFF. Got it?
	I think I’ll hold onto this. It’s
	pretty.
	ADOLF (O.S.)
	Sheesh, that was intense.
	JOJO
	Adolf, what am I gonna do??
	ADOLF
	Honestly, NO idea. You’re definitely
	in a pickle. How the hell did she get
	control like that?
	JOJO
	She used her Jew powers I guess. Mind
	control.
	ADOLF
	Is that a real thing?
	I really should know about that.
	Did you see how fast she moved? And
	now she’s got that fancy knife.
	JOJO
	I know, I know! My knife! Okay, we
	have to think.
	ADOLF
	I’ve got it. Burn down the house.
	JOJO
	You think?
	ADOLF
	It’s the only way.
	JOJO
	I might get in trouble.
	ADOLF
	Good point.
	Got it. Burn the house down, blame it
	on Winston Churchill.
	JOJO
	No, I can’t do that. This is MY family
	home. I think I have to negotiate.
	ADOLF
	Even better! That’s the spirit.
	Negotiate. Ooh, ooh, and remember,
	don’t mention the war.
	JOJO
	Excuse me? Hello? Little girl? Um, Jew
	girl in the wall?
	Yoohoo, Jew?
	Ok well, I’ll just say what I have to
	say.
	I don’t think it’s very convenient for
	you to be in my house and I’m not
	happy that my mother let you stay
	here. I’m sure she has her reasons but
	it really can’t go on.
	Now, I’m aware you have my knife. I
	can’t say I’m comfortable with that
	because it’s a Nazi knife and you’re
	obviously... Anyway, I just want you
	to know I’m not scared of you and I
	think you should find somewhere else
	to live. You have until tomorrow to
	leave, then everyone will be happy.
	Ok?
	ELSA (O.S.)
	Not okay.
	JOJO
	Arrgh!!!
	ADOLF
	Great, now she’s got TWO knives!
	JOJO
	I know!
	ADOLF
	How are you going to chop up stuff?!
	JOJO
	I don’t know!
	ADOLF
	And she’s still up there!
	JOJO
	You’re the expert, you think of
	something!
	I don’t smoke! Stop offering me
	fucking cigarettes! I’m TEN!
	ADOLF
	Sorry, sorry, this is stressful.
	Okay, let’s talk like turkeys. I guess
	you can’t tell your mother or the Jew
	will cut off your Nazi head. No real
	way around that right now. But y’know,
	there’s no reason this thing in the
	attic needs to ruin your life. I think
	you could use it to your advantage.
	JOJO
	How?
	ADOLF
	Well, when someone tries to use mindpowers on me, you know what I do?
	Use mind powers back on them.
	Remember last year when that pirate,
	Von Stauffenberg tried to blow me up
	with a bomb?
	JOJO
	Yeah, but you survived.
	ADOLF
	Correct-a-mundo. But the only reason I
	survived, apart from having bomb-proof
	legs, is because I outwitted old Von
	Stauffy. I let him think I was dead
	when in actual fact I was fine. By
	pretending I was dead I drew out all
	the traitors. So, what are you going
	to do?
	JOJO
	Pretend I’m dead?
	ADOLF
	Exactly. Wait. No. I think what I mean
	is this: Make her feel safe and she
	will drop her guard and then you will
	be the one in control.
	JOJO
	Is that “Reverse Psychology”?
	ADOLF
	Umm, I don’t think so. Let’s not
	complicate things. Stick with my idea -
	use mind-powers back on her - and
	you’ll be fine.
	I gotta go. Good luck and remember the
	old saying: a Jew living in your wall
	is better than a two Jews flying
	around eating innocent Nazis.
	And don’t give her any more KNIVES!
	JOJO
	Mama!
	FRAU BETZLER
	Darling, darling, why are you still
	up? Did you eat?
	JOJO
	It’s 10 o’clock. Where have you been?!
	FRAU BETZLER
	Oh cub, I was just taking a long walk
	and having a think. I lost track of
	time.
	JOJO
	Mama you should be careful. They frown
	upon those who display sneaky
	behaviour.
	33.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Sneaky?! You goose. I promise things
	will be back to normal soon. Trust me.
	How was the Hitlerjugend? Did you get
	some helpful work done today?
	JOJO
	Yes. Mama, I need to have a grown-up
	conversation with you.
	And what did you achieve?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Oh, your laces, you really must--
	JOJO
	I heard the her.
	FRAU BETZLER
	What?
	JOJO
	Inga. Her ghost is here.
	FRAU BETZLER
	(laughing)
	Oh for Heaven’s sake what are you
	talking about?
	JOJO
	Noises.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Oh come on. You mean the RATS?! We
	have rats in the attic and yes, I’ve
	heard them too. Honestly, ghosts?!
	Actually, I’ve been meaning to say;
	you probably shouldn’t go up there
	till I’ve caught them all, they have
	diseases and I don’t need you getting
	sick. Okay?
	Okay?
	JOJO
	Okay mama.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Now, I left my gloves in a dream,
	could you be a darling and go get them
	for me?
	JOJO
	Mama, do you miss papa?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Like the sun misses the moon.
	JOJO
	And you miss Inga.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Like the moon misses the sun.
	JOJO
	Are you going to bed now?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Of course. I need to tidy up some
	things before bed.
	JOJO
	What things?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Mama things. Boy, you really have to
	trust me, I’m the boss here.
	Like this.
	Yeah, but with just one eye. You can
	do it.
	There you go! You got it! Now go get
	my gloves, will ya? I left them by a
	rainbow.
	JOJO
	Mama what are you doing?? It’s not
	allowed...
	HELGA
	Yes, stretch, you must stretch. Now
	squeeze my hand. Squeeze!
	JOJO
	Excuse me, Herr Klenzendorf.
	KLENZENDORF
	Ahh, Jojo. What do you think of this?
	It’s a type of Gatling Gun. It is also
	mounted with a radio which emits
	annoying music to deflect the enemy. I
	was thinking Pachelbel would be good.
	JOJO
	Do you do any actual real work?
	KLENZENDORF
	Nope. However, now and then I help out
	the Grey Goons.
	JOJO
	Who?
	KLENZENDORF
	Gestapo. They are low on numbers so
	sometimes they make me help them with
	their investigations.
	JOJO
	Ah, that must be exciting, solving
	crimes and finding people.
	KLENZENDORF
	Honestly, they couldn’t find arse in a
	shit factory, but if you’re looking
	for someone they’re your best bet.
	It’s actually quite boring but at
	least I get out of this office and
	away from the children. My true place
	is at the front. I’m a soldier, not a
	baby-sitter.
	JOJO
	Can I ask you about Jews?
	KLENZENDORF
	Oh God, why?
	JOJO
	I’m curious. What happens if I see
	one?
	KLENZENDORF
	Hide the end of your penis!
	Ha haha, oh boy, I needed that.
	FINKEL
	Oh yes, me too Captain K. I really
	needed to laugh.
	KLENZENDORF
	Ok, so in reality if you see a Jew you
	tell us and then we tell the Gestapo
	and they tell the SS and then they go
	and kill the Jew. And anyone who
	helped the Jew. And, because these are
	very paranoid times, probably some
	other people just in case. It’s very
	convoluted.
	JOJO
	Even if the Jew hypnotised someone to
	make them hide the Jew in the first
	place?
	KLENZENDORF
	Err, yep. Though I’d be amazed if that
	could happen. Did you see one?
	JOJO
	Nope. I wouldn’t be able to tell even
	if I did.
	KLENZENDORF
	Me neither. Without their funny hats
	it’s damn near impossible. Someone
	should write a book on the subject.
	JOJO
	I have to go deliver these
	conscriptions.
	KLENZENDORF
	Yes, good man. And watch your willy
	out there.
	JOJO
	Ok here’s the situation. If I tell on
	you, you’ll be in big trouble and I
	don’t think you want that. But then
	you’ll tell on me and my mother, which
	I don’t want. And if you tell my
	mother I know, then she’ll kick you
	out which you don’t want. And if I
	tell my mother I know, then you’ll cut
	off my head, which I don’t want.
	ELSA
	A stalemate.
	JOJO
	Indeed. So, we must make a compromise.
	I have thought deeply about this and I
	now conclude that it’s better to have
	you locked up in the house rather than
	letting you run around town causing
	Jewish havoc.
	ELSA
	I see.
	39.
	JOJO
	However, I have some conditions for
	allowing you to stay here in my house.
	ELSA
	Conditions?
	JOJO
	Yes. I will not cause any trouble for
	you if you promise to tell me
	everything about the Jewish race.
	ELSA
	Ok. We’re like you but human. Done.
	JOJO
	Please take this seriously. I want to
	know all your secrets, how you shapeshift, what you eat, how to tell a Jew
	from a real person and, where you
	build your hives. Think of it as an
	exposé.
	ELSA
	An exposé.
	JOJO
	On Jews, yes. I will deliver my
	findings to the authorities and
	hopefully get a medal or promotion of
	some sort.
	ELSA
	Wow.
	JOJO
	What? I think that’s quite reasonable.
	ELSA
	You’re a little bit of an idiot aren’t
	you? Why do you want this?
	JOJO
	Because I’m interested, that’s all.
	ELSA
	There are already Jew hunters.
	JOJO
	Well they’re not doing their best are
	they? You’ve been here at least a
	month.
	ELSA
	Three to be exact.
	JOJO
	Three?!
	ELSA
	You were asleep for two of them.
	JOJO
	Kindly refrain from sitting on my
	sister’s bed.
	ELSA
	Why? She doesn’t need it.
	JOJO
	You know nothing of my sister.
	ELSA
	You don’t remember me do you?
	Inga and I were friends. I took violin
	lessons with her when we were 10. We
	practiced in this very room, sat on
	this very bed. I was sad to hear of
	her passing.
	JOJO
	You are not to talk of her.
	ELSA
	I remember you too. Such a funny
	little boy, always trying to get in
	here and play. Who knew you’d grow
	into such a little... Nazi.
	JOJO
	Enough with the small talk. Start
	telling me about your kind. I’m
	interested especially in how you can
	turn into animals and what your real
	skin looks like.
	And the horns please.
	ELSA
	The neighbours are suspicious. They
	always watch the house.
	JOJO
	Then get away from the window.
	ELSA
	The world is paranoid isn’t it?
	Everyone watching each other,
	informing on each other.
	JOJO
	You’re really not telling me anything
	useful. Now, there are some things I
	already know, like the fact that you -
	Jews - love ugliness. You don’t like
	pretty things like... flowers or
	butterflies.
	ELSA
	Where did you hear that?
	JOJO
	School.
	ELSA
	You like butterflies?
	JOJO
	They’re okay. I’m more into guns. What
	do you like?
	ELSA
	Ok. We are demons who love money,
	that’s clear right?
	JOJO
	Of course.
	ELSA
	But what people don’t know is that we
	are also allergic to food.
	JOJO
	What?
	ELSA
	Cheese, bread and sausages. Those
	things will kill us instantly. So...
	if you’re thinking of ending my life,
	feeding me those things is the
	quickest way. And Cake. Lethal.
	JOJO
	Very funny.
	ELSA
	I’m going back in my cave, the
	sunlight weakens me.
	JOJO
	Ok, that’s enough for today. We’ll
	continue tomorrow.
	Okay?
	ELSA (O.S.)
	Piss off.
	ADOLF (O.S.)
	She’s pretty rude, y’know.
	That’s just my 2 pfennige.
	JOJO
	She doesn’t want to talk to me. This
	book is going to be harder to write
	than I thought.
	ADOLF
	Do you want to play Cowboys and
	Indians? It might help take your mind
	off the whole secret Jewish girl in
	the attic thing.
	FRAU BETZLER (O.S.)
	Hallo house! I’m home!
	JOJO
	She can’t see you.
	ADOLF
	I know. Especially not now that I’m
	blending in to my surroundings.
	It also helps if I can’t see her.
	He closes his eyes tightly. Frau Betzler enters.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Hello my darling!
	JOJO
	Where have you been? It’s 6 o’clock
	and I’ve had a hell of a day.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Sorry, my love. I was at the library.
	JOJO
	We can’t eat books!
	FRAU BETZLER
	How do you know? Have you even tried?
	Don’t limit yourself, kid.
	Come now Jojo. I’m still a mama Lion
	you know. And mama Lions are the best
	hunters in the pride...
	JOJO
	Where did you get that?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Who’s asking?
	JOJO
	Me. Where is it from?
	FRAU BETZLER
	God, What are you, the Food Gestapo?
	Sheesh kid, give a girl a break. These
	are tough times and I got us food; end
	of discussion!
	JOJO
	Who was out the window?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Himmler. He’s cleaning the yard and
	I’m making sure he doesn’t slack on
	the job.
	ADOLF
	Phew.
	Well, I guess Cowboys and Indians is
	off the cards. I may as well go home
	and have dinner too.
	She lied by the way; your mother.
	Himmler’s not out there.
	JOJO
	Why so cheerful?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Oh, I heard some good news that’s all.
	JOJO
	What news?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Things are changing. The Allies have
	nearly taken Italy. The war will soon
	be over.
	JOJO
	God Dammit.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Jojo, language.
	JOJO
	The war will soon end but it will be
	the Reich who stands tall and proud.
	We will crush the Roast Beef
	Englishmen like I am crushing this
	piece of bread.
	My strength hasn’t returned but you
	get my point.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Ok! Can we just eat?!
	No more politics. The dinner table is
	neutral ground, it’s Switzerland.
	Would you like to say Grace?
	JOJO
	God in Heaven, please watch over our
	beloved Germany, the great Third
	Reich, and our father Adolf Hitler who
	is the bestest, most wonderf--
	FRAU BETZLER
	AMEN! Let’s eat.
	JOJO
	Is papa really coming home?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Of course.
	JOJO
	What if he doesn’t?
	FRAU BETZLER
	What nonsense, of course he’s coming
	home. And the whole family will be
	together again.
	JOJO
	Except her.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Who?
	JOJO
	Inga.
	FRAU BETZLER
	No. But of course she will be with
	us... in our hearts.
	JOJO
	I miss her.
	Maybe we should get rid of her stuff
	and use the room for something else.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Hm. Yes, maybe when papa comes home he
	can use it for a study.
	JOJO
	Perhaps.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Are you done? May I take your plate?
	JOJO
	No. I’m going to eat everything like a
	good little boy. I’ll even eat your
	leftovers if you don’t mind.
	JOJO
	Now, I want you to draw a picture of
	where Jews live. A typical hive; where
	you all sleep, eat and where the Queen
	Jew lays the eggs.
	ELSA
	You really are an idiot.
	JOJO
	Tell me about your family.
	ELSA
	My father is a 3-headed space-dog and
	my mother is a piglet who wears
	clothes to blend in.
	I’ll tell you about Jews but you are
	not privileged to know about my
	family.
	JOJO
	I need background.
	ELSA
	Ask them yourself.
	JOJO
	Where are they?
	ELSA
	In the other wall. I think I heard
	them chewing on diamonds.
	JOJO
	I don’t have time for this.
	48.
	ELSA
	I do. I have all the time in the
	world.
	JOJO
	I wouldn’t be sure of that.
	ELSA
	Let me ask you something. Why are you
	hanging around with me? Don’t you have
	any friends?
	JOJO
	Of course. Many
	ELSA
	Who?
	JOJO
	Yorki.
	ELSA
	“Yorki”. And...
	JOJO
	Others.
	ELSA
	Pff. You don’t have any friends.
	JOJO
	You don’t. You don’t have anyone.
	ELSA
	I have Nathan.
	JOJO
	Who the hell is that?
	ELSA
	My fiancée. I have him.
	JOJO
	A Jew too I suppose.
	ELSA
	Yes, and a very strong one.
	JOJO
	Where is he?
	ELSA
	Everywhere he is needed. He’s fighting
	in the resistance. He’s eighteen.
	JOJO
	Eurgh, how ugly. You deserve each
	other.
	ELSA
	Yes, we do.
	He proposed to me on the banks of the
	Fluss. By Jaegerplatz. He knelt down
	like a proper gentleman, recited a
	poem by Rilke, and when I said ‘yes’
	we danced down the street.
	JOJO
	Snore. Who’s Rilke?
	ELSA
	A great Poet, Austrian, Nathan’s
	favourite.
	JOJO
	Ooooooh, Naaaathan’s favourite. I
	think you mean German by the way.
	ELSA
	Austrian. Anyway, shut up. Nathan’s
	coming, he’ll rescue me and then we’ll
	go live in Paris.
	JOJO
	Errr, News-Flash; we occupy Paris.
	ELSA
	Not for long. Your mother said it’s
	about to fall.
	JOJO
	Oh God, what would she know??
	ELSA
	More than you think. You hear those
	bombs? They are landing on your
	precious Reich. It’s said that Germany
	will fall within a year. Then I will
	be free.
	I will leave this place and this town,
	find Nathan, start a new life, and
	never look back.
	JOJO
	You would turn your back on Germany
	forever.
	ELSA
	She turned on me first.
	JOJO
	Yeah well we don’t need you. You and
	your stupid boyfriend can shut up and
	go live in dumb-French-land. Good
	luck.
	ELSA
	Now, now, just because you don’t have
	a girlfriend.
	JOJO
	Pah! Don’t need one. I’m too busy for
	girls.
	ELSA
	One day you’ll make time.
	You’ll think of nothing else. You’ll
	meet a girl and spend your days
	dreaming of the moment you can hold
	her in your arms again. And she’ll
	think the same of you. This is called
	love.
	JOJO
	Okayyyyy.
	Sorry there wasn’t enough food
	tonight.
	ELSA
	Your mother managed to find some
	bread. She is kind. She thought you
	suspected something but I told her you
	weren’t smart enough.
	JOJO
	I’m glad you’re so friendly with her.
	ELSA
	She’s nice to me. She treats me like a
	person.
	JOJO
	But you’re not. Not a proper person.
	ELSA
	Are you?
	JOJO
	How dare you, Jew. You are weak
	like... a weak eyelash. I am born of
	Aryan ancestry, the strongest race on
	Earth. My blood is the colour of a
	pure red rose and my eyes are blue
	like a sapphi--
	Ow ow ow ow ow ow...
	She covers his mouth, suffocating him.
	Mmmph!
	ELSA
	Break free.
	JOJO
	Mmrrmmph.
	ELSA
	Break free, great Aryan.
	There are no weak Jews. I am descended
	from those who wrestle angels and kill
	giants. We were chosen by God. You
	were chosen by a fat man with greasy
	hair and half a moustache.
	The stronger race, huh?
	JOJO
	I said draw where Jews live. This is
	just a stupid picture of my head.
	ELSA
	That’s where we live.
	SECRETARY
	Are you denouncing a neighbour,
	political traitor, or informing on
	friends and family?
	JOJO
	I am looking for someone. I haven’t
	seen them in a while. I was wondering
	if you had any files on them.
	SECRETARY
	I’m obviously busy.
	SECRETARY (CONT’D)
	Why don’t you go have a look back
	there in the file room.
	Erwin!
	As you can see we’re understaffed and
	inundated with files and reports.
	These days being an informant has
	become a national pastime.
	SECRETARY (CONT’D)
	Erwin, take him to the file-room.
	Now!
	Hello. Denouncing a neighbour,
	political traitor, or informing on
	friends and family?
	OLD LADY
	Family.
	JOJO
	Nathan Raame, Nathan Raaaaame, where
	are you, stupid Nathan, poetry reading
	dumbhead?
	HITLER
	Great thinking, Rabbit. We’ll use
	these to make a fake floor that she
	can fall through, straight into some
	piranhas.
	Or hot lava-- no, piranhas is good.
	She won’t know what hit her when she
	starts getting chomped by those little
	fishies!
	JUNGVOLK
	We are marching for Hitler through
	Night and Need, with the flag of the
	youth, for freedom and bread.
	We were born to die for Germany!
	FRAULEIN RAHM
	Come on everyone, one more time!
	ADOLF
	The humps are filled with water?!
	ELSA (O.S.)
	I wonder who it could possibly be?
	JOJO
	It’s Johannes Betzler. The little boy
	who lives downstairs.
	ELSA (O.S.)
	I knowwwwww...
	JOJO
	Oh. Well, I have something to tell
	you. I happened to be doing some
	important filing today and I came
	across an old letter from Nathan -
	your fiancée - addressed to you. It’s
	quite lucky I found it.
	ELSA (O.S.)
	What the hell are you talking about?
	JOJO
	I have a letter from Nathan. Shall I
	read it to you?
	ELSA
	Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say
	but I don’t want to marry you anymore.
	I found another woman and we laugh and
	have good talks. I’m sure there’s
	better people for you anyway. It’s
	like my favourite poet Rilke says:
	“We need, in love, to practice only
	this: letting each other go.”
	So goodbye and sorry about dumping
	you. From Nathan your ex-fiancée.
	PS. I am not really in the resistance
	I was lying. I am unemployed.
	JOJO
	Oh. Why are you doing that?
	ELSA
	Please leave.
	JOJO
	Hi.
	Are you still alive?
	ELSA (O.S.)
	Barely.
	JOJO
	Oh, well that’s good. Um, don’t open
	the door because it’s risky today. So
	I actually forgot there was a second
	letter. I forgot I had it. I’ll just
	read it.
	Dear Elsa. I just wanted to say that I
	don’t want to break up with you now. I
	changed my mind because I don’t want
	you to kill yourself over me which a
	couple of girls have done in the past
	and it gives me nightmares.
	So, let’s still get married sometime -
	even though I truly am unemployed and
	have nothing much going for me. I
	don’t even know how to tie a knot or
	read a map. Yours, Nathan.
	No X’s or O’s I’m afraid but it still
	seems pretty positive.
	JOJO
	Beethoven.
	ELSA
	Einstein.
	57.
	JOJO
	Bach.
	ELSA
	Gerschwin.
	JOJO
	Brahms.
	Mozart.
	Wagner.
	ELSA
	All musicians, is that all you have?!
	JOJO
	Freud then.
	ELSA
	Ha! You dare take Freud?!
	No, no, no, never. He’s ours.
	JOJO
	He’s German!
	ELSA
	No Freud for you! Or Proust.
	JOJO
	Rilke.
	ELSA
	Oh of course, your favourite, Rilke.
	Jewish mother.
	JOJO
	Well no one takes Goethe.
	ELSA
	Keep him, we have Kafka.
	JOJO
	Durer.
	ELSA
	Pah... Chagall shits on Durer. A big
	Russian shit on your boring Durer.
	JOJO
	Marlene Dietrich, then.
	ELSA
	Houdini.
	JOJO
	Nooooo... impossible.
	ELSA
	Believe it brother. Just ask Pissaro,
	Modigliani, Max Jacob, Man Ray,
	Henschel, Nimzowitsch, Gertrude Stein,
	Mr. Moses and Jesus Christi, Amen.
	JOJO
	You’re just saying any old name now.
	I’ve never heard of these people and
	now I’m fed up.
	ELSA
	Night.
	STOREMAN
	Three? I remember you only used two in
	the past.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Ah, yes, but I have developed a more
	efficient system. I now use 3 ration
	cards, taking enough for 2 to eat, but
	then we take twice as long to eat it,
	you see? 3 for 2, which makes 6. But
	here’s where it gets interesting; you
	take the original number times it by
	3, carry the 7, subtract 2, then add 2
	again, then divide the whole thing by the
	potatoes.
	Simple, no?
	Excuse me, look out, German coming
	through.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Once there were fireworks. To
	celebrate them coming home. Now the
	sky is empty.
	At least it’s still romantic down here
	at the Fluss. There used to be lovers
	walking these banks, dancing. But
	now...
	JOJO
	Mama, there is no time for romance, we
	are at war.
	FRAU BETZLER
	There is always time for romance Jojo.
	One day you will meet someone special.
	JOJO
	Why does everyone keep telling me
	that?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Who else tells you?
	JOJO
	Everyone. Anyway, it’s a stupid idea.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Love isn’t stupid, cub. It’s the
	strongest thing in the world.
	JOJO
	I think you’ll find that metal is the
	strongest thing in the world, followed
	closely by dynamite and then muscles
	in third place.
	Besides, I wouldn’t even know it if I
	saw it.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Love?
	JOJO
	Yes, that. I suppose it smells like
	flowers or soap.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Oh surprise, surprise, your shoelaces
	undone. Again.
	“I’m Jojo and I don’t know how to tie
	my shoelaces even though I’m 10”.
	No Jojo. Love has no smell. It has no
	shape and it has no sound.
	JOJO
	Well then how would anyone know? It
	can’t exist.
	FRAU BETZLER
	You’ll know it when it happens. You’ll
	feel it.
	JOJO
	Like a pain in my arse I bet.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Nope, in your tummy. Like butterflies.
	And your heart. It’s like you’re full
	of butterflies.
	JOJO
	Butterflies huh? Yuck.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Yeah, yuck. Come on Shitler, let’s get
	a move on.
	JOJO
	Wha??
	FRAU BETZLER
	Haha! Come on kid, get your act
	together, don’t you know how to walk
	properly?
	JOJO
	Mama, stop it!
	FRAU BETZLER
	What’s wrong Jojo? Get it together,
	man. I’m worried about you, are you
	drunk?
	Excuse me, can you help? My child is
	drunk.
	JOJO
	Don’t believe her!
	FRAU BETZLER
	“I’m Jojo and I shouldn’t trust pretty
	ladies to tie my shoelaces...”
	FRAU BETZLER
	Hey Jojo?
	JOJO
	Yes, Rosie?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Promise me one thing will you? When
	this is all over and the world is
	normal again, try to be a normal kid
	again?
	JOJO
	I don’t know what you’re talking
	about.
	FRAU BETZLER
	You’re growing up too fast. A ten year
	old shouldn’t be celebrating war or
	talking politics. You should be having
	fun, climbing trees and then falling
	out of those trees.
	JOJO
	But I must love war. Our father says
	when we win, it is us young boys who
	will rule the world.
	FRAU BETZLER
	The Reich is dying. There will be
	nothing to rule. Your beloved angry
	man is losing. And you already have a
	father.
	JOJO
	And where is he? Winning the war?
	FRAU BETZLER
	He is more of a man than any of your
	heroes... Oh Gott...
	JOJO
	Huh? That’s not our address.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Fascinating isn’t it?! Oh so
	interesting!
	JOJO
	What does it mean, mama?
	FRAU BETZLER
	Oh, pff, nothing darling. Those damned
	neighbourhood kids playing pranks!
	It’s probably some sort of funny joke!
	JOJO
	O-5...?
	FRAU BETZLER
	It’s probably their age. Ha!
	JOJO
	It’s probably their I.Q.
	FRAU BETZLER
	Exactly! O5! So funny, I love it!
	ELSA
	What’s wrong?
	JOJO
	I’m just distracted. There’s a gang of
	5 year-old vandals running around the
	neighbourhood.
	ELSA
	I heard people near the house earlier.
	JOJO
	That’s them. Degenerate toddlers
	harassing innocent people. I’m worried
	about my mother.
	No news from Nathan today I’m afraid.
	He’s probably doing something amazing
	like blowing up trains or growing a
	moustache.
	ELSA
	You want me to tell you about the
	Jews?
	Get comfortable.
	In the beginning we used to live in
	caves, deep, deep in the centre of the
	Earth.
	JOJO
	Wait.
	ELSA
	Scary places full of strange and
	wonderful creatures all with one thing
	in common...
	JOJO
	Stealing the ends of penises.
	ELSA
	No you idiot. A love of art and
	poetry.
	JOJO
	No cutting penises off?
	ELSA
	You want the story or not?
	JOJO
	You may continue. But I know it’s
	true, the penis thing. Rabbis use them
	for earplugs.
	ELSA
	Aaaand moving on. So, after many years
	of developing magic and spells, we
	slowly moved out of the caves and into
	the towns. Some of us stayed in the
	caves and stayed in our normal bodies.
	JOJO
	Which are... blobs or something?
	ELSA
	Well, I’ll draw them for you.
	It would be better with colour but all
	I have is this blunt pencil.
	JOJO
	Where’s the horns?
	ELSA
	Um, they’re under the hair.
	JOJO
	Where are yours?
	ELSA
	I’m too young. They grow when you turn
	21.
	JOJO
	Ahhh...
	He writes that down too.
	ELSA
	Anyway, these days we live among
	normal humans but often we will take
	over a house and hang from the ceiling
	when we sleep, like bats. Oh, one
	interesting thing is that we can read
	each others’ minds.
	JOJO
	Everyone’s minds? What about German
	minds?
	ELSA
	No, they are too thick for us to
	penetrate. We can only read Jewish
	thoughts.
	JOJO
	So you’re weaker when you’re separated
	from your hive...
	ELSA
	Exactly.
	JOJO
	Oh my God, this is so good. So what
	are your other weaknesses?
	ELSA
	Well, although we used to be able to
	fly unfortunately we can’t anymore -
	otherwise I’d be long gone.
	JOJO
	Of course.
	ELSA
	Our wings got burnt off after that
	whole Jesus debacle. Punishment from
	God.
	JOJO
	Makes sense.
	ELSA
	Oh, and we are attracted to shiny
	things, like birds. That is why we
	came to the beautiful cities of
	Germany, all the glass and gold and
	crystals.
	JOJO
	Attracted to shiny things... but also
	ugly things, Jews love ugliness.
	That’s another thing we learned in
	school.
	Ugly things yes? You love them?
	ELSA
	No, not ugly things, exotic things.
	JOJO
	Hmm yes, they love ugly things.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Ahem...
	JOJO
	Wha-- Hey, that’s my bed.
	ADOLF
	You two seem to be getting on well.
	JOJO
	Who?
	ADOLF
	You and old Jew face.
	JOJO
	No, I just...
	ADOLF
	I was jus-- I was jus--
	JOJO
	I was making sure she was still alive.
	ADOLF
	What do you care?
	JOJO
	I don’t. But I also don’t want a dead
	person in my house. How would you like
	it?
	ADOLF
	I wouldn’t care. I’m tough. Look, I
	want to believe you but part of me
	doesn’t. Whatever that feeling is
	called. That and all the time you guys
	are spending together... I have to
	admit, it makes me uncomfortable.
	JOJO
	Well, you suggested it in the first
	place. Besides, it’s for the book.
	ADOLF
	Okay, sorry. You’re right. Oh no, I’ve
	made it weird between us, haven’t I?
	Is it weird? Oh god, it’s weird now.
	JOJO
	It’s fine, look I’m just tired. I need
	to go to bed.
	ADOLF
	Sure, I was just keeping it warm for
	you.
	Hey do you think this uniform is
	slimming? I’m not sure about the hips
	on the pants. I’ve seen them on other
	people and honestly, they make the
	thighs look absolutely HUGE.
	JOJO
	You look great. As usual.
	ADOLF
	What about the moustache? I’m thinking
	about losing it. It seemed like a
	great idea at first but now I’m not
	sure. It’s always there, like a little
	black worm. Whenever I look at my face
	I just see this stupid thing crawling
	on my lip.
	JOJO
	Well, it’s kind of your trademark now.
	ADOLF
	You’re right. I guess I’ll keep it.
	Thanks, I can always count on you to
	make me feel better. You’re like an
	honest and reliable son to me.
	JOJO
	And you’re like a fashionable dad.
	ADOLF
	Be careful Jojo, and remember this
	good advice from me. Once you see
	what's in her mind and where she's
	trying to get you to go - in your own
	head, you must go the other way. Don’t
	let her put you in a brain prison! You
	must be strong, you must always be
	alert and ready for anything. She's
	dangerous and cunning like an
	unpredictable baby opossum. Before you
	know it, you’ve got that thing
	clinging to your face, and that, dear
	Jojo, is one thing that does cannot
	happen to a German! Do not let her
	boss your German brain around!
	JOJO
	I won’t let my brain be bossed around
	by her, mein Führer.
	ADOLF
	Try not to. Bossing around people’s
	brains is extremely rude and uncalled
	for. It looks like you’ve got a lot of
	good information so far. Now to share
	it with others, yes?
	JOJO
	Um Adolf, do you think I’m... ugly?
	ADOLF
	Is that a trick question?
	Is there another word for ugly but not
	quite as offensive?
	JOJO
	I don’t think so.
	ADOLF
	Well if there was, that’d be you to a
	tee. Anyway, ugly isn’t a bad thing.
	Field Marshal Rommel was absolutely
	hideous but he made up for it with
	great joke telling abilities.
	Sweet dreams, little Rabbit.
	KLENZENDORF
	Heyyy, look who it is!
	OFFICER 1
	The Handgrenade kid!
	KLENZENDORF
	So, how can we help you today? Are you
	missing a pee-pee?
	JOJO
	I’m not missing my pee-pee.
	KLENZENDORF
	What? Oh, false alarm Finkel. All peepee’s are accounted for. What’s up?
	JOJO
	If someone turned in a Jew would they
	get a medal or something?
	KLENZENDORF
	Have you found one?
	JOJO
	I’m on the lookout. I’m learning a lot
	about Jews actually.
	KLENZENDORF
	Really?
	JOJO
	Did you know they are attracted to
	shiny things and they sleep upside
	down from the ceiling, like bats?
	KLENZENDORF
	Ok, bats, yes.
	JOJO
	And another thing you might be
	interested to know is they can read
	each others’ minds and their true
	language sounds like birds chirping.
	KLENZENDORF
	And where on earth did you come by
	this information?
	JOJO
	Research. I’m writing a book.
	KLENZENDORF
	What’s it called?
	JOJO
	“Yoohoo Jew”.
	KLENZENDORF
	Pardon?
	JOJO
	“Yoohoo Jew”. It’s an expose on Jews.
	KLENZENDORF
	“Yoohoo Jew”, oh my god, I love it!
	You could also call it “Jew, Who?”
	Ooh! Ooh! What about “Jews News”??
	FINKEL
	What about Jew... Spoo... Loo
	KLENZENDORF
	Oh my, look at that. This guy is
	riding a giraffe.
	JOJO
	One of their modes of transport.
	This is a drawing of their anatomy.
	Look, this one here shows the inside
	of their heads.
	KLENZENDORF
	Yes, I can see, they’re filled with
	sawdust! So informative! You’re
	something else kid. Well, it’s all
	very interesting stuff Jojo but I’m
	afraid right now I have slightly more
	important things on my plate. Namely
	the impending invasion of our
	wonderful Vienna. But boy, you do have
	an imagination on you, I love it!
	JOJO
	But it’s real, not imagina--
	KLENZENDORF
	Oh, of course it is! When I was your
	age I had a “friend” called Kack who
	used wet my bed when I was asleep. He
	got me in so much trouble.
	He also shit my pants sometimes.
	Naughty Kack.
	JOJO
	I already have an imaginary friend. I
	know the difference.
	KLENZENDORF
	Hey, you might like to check out my
	drawings. I’m re-designing the SSUniforms. A re-vamp if you will.
	It’s based loosely on East Asian
	fashions but also has a distinct
	pirate skew. Sort of warrior meets
	musketeer. Note the feathers down the
	arms for aerodynamics. The sparkly
	collar is to dazzle the enemy and the
	pirate hat is purely decorational.
	Same with the high-heel boots.
	This is all copyrighted by the way.
	FINKEL
	It’s copyrighted which means you can’t
	copy it.
	JOJO
	Are there any conscriptions today?
	KLENZENDORF
	No, not right now. But I do have
	another job for you. I won’t lie, it’s
	a bit of a step-down from delivering
	conscriptions but you still get some
	good face time with the locals.
	FINKEL
	Jew. Shoe... Boo.. Hoo.
	JOJO
	Good morning Frau. Our brave troops
	and wonderful Führer need your help. I
	am collecting much needed metal for
	the war effort which will provide our
	troops with... um, bullets and
	airplanes. And guns, tanks, ships, Uboats, bombs. And Iron Crosses.
	OLD WOMAN
	What?
	JOJO
	Do you have anything metal?
	OLD WOMAN
	What?
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Jojo?
	JOJO
	Yorki!
	You’re a soldier?
	YORKI
	At your service!
	JOJO
	But you’re only 12.
	YORKI
	I know! They think we’re just as good
	as the older lads so they’re
	recruiting us early. And look at this
	uniform, it’s state of the art!
	JOJO
	It’s thin. Is that... paper?
	YORKI
	Hmm, that’s what I thought at first
	too. But it’s “paper like”. It’s the
	latest material invented by our top
	scientists. It keeps you warm in snow
	and cool in the desert. It’s also
	impervious to shrapnel, bullets and
	some bombs. And, because it will never
	degrade I can grow into it!
	JOJO
	Well, I’m impressed. You finally made
	it. Next stop, Hitler’s guard.
	YORKI
	Exactly! And I’m only 12! So geil!
	What have you been doing?
	JOJO
	I... caught a Jew. A real one.
	YORKI
	Wow, good for you! I saw some that
	they caught hiding in the forest last
	month. Personally I didn’t see what
	all the fuss was about. They weren’t
	at all scary and seemed kind of
	normal. But don’t tell anyone I said
	that.
	I have to go show this uniform to my
	mama. Take care Jojo, you’re looking
	good!
	JOJO
	Yorki, can I ask a favour?
	YORKI
	Of course!
	JOJO
	I got you this, it’s nothing, just
	stupid pencils. It doesn’t mean
	anything. They’re probably broken.
	ELSA
	Thank you.
	JOJO
	I doubt they even work.
	ELSA
	Thank you.
	JOJO
	Yeah well, maybe you can draw
	something. Maybe more pictures for my
	book. Or not. I don’t care.
	ELSA
	Can I draw you again?
	JOJO
	Don’t make fun please.
	ELSA
	I’m not.
	JOJO
	Find a real face.
	ELSA
	It is a real face.
	JOJO
	You’re blind. It’s a bad, ugly face.
	No normal person would come near this.
	ELSA
	The outside is not what’s important.
	JOJO
	It makes a pretty big difference
	actually. The girl from Jungvolk,
	Gudrun, she used to like me but now,
	no way.
	ELSA
	What do you care what she thinks?
	JOJO
	Um, because she’s only the prettiest
	girl in the whole town.
	ELSA
	If she was that special she wouldn’t
	even see your face.
	JOJO
	Well that’s not a problem seeing she
	can’t bare to look at me. Look, it’s
	fine, I’ll just accept that I’ll be
	one of those guys who will never get
	to kiss a girl.
	And I’m not fishing for anything by
	the way. I feel quite strongly about
	this.
	ELSA
	You will be kissed, Jojo.
	JOJO
	By someone’s grandmother, sure.
	ELSA
	Do you want me to kiss you?
	JOJO
	Woah. Ok, 2 things. Thing number one:
	it’s illegal for Nazis and Jews to
	hang out like we do, let alone kiss,
	so already it’s out of the question.
	And thing number 2: it would just be a
	sympathy kiss which doesn’t count.
	ELSA
	You’re not a Nazi.
	JOJO
	What are you talking about? Of course
	I am.
	ELSA
	You’re not a Nazi.
	JOJO
	I’m into Swastikas. In fact, I love
	‘em so I think that’s a pretty good
	sign right there.
	ELSA
	You’re not a Nazi, Jojo.
	JOJO
	Not to be rude but I don’t think you
	know anything about Nazis.
	ELSA
	I don’t think you do either. You’re a
	10 year old kid who ‘likes’ Swastikas
	and dressing up in a funny uniform.
	The rest... is something else. But
	you’re not one of them. Not you.
	JOJO
	Okayyyy... Let’s just agree to
	disagree alright?
	Not a Nazi, ha.
	ELSA
	What a dirty Jew.
	ELSA
	‘Living room’. Funny name.
	JOJO
	Stay away from the windows.
	ELSA
	Yes, Dad.
	JOJO
	It’s all I could get.
	Mama’s home. You better hide.
	JOJO
	Lost your key, Mama?
	DEERTZ
	Heil Hitler. Allow me to introduce
	myself. I am Captain Herman Deertz of
	the Vienna Gestapo, Floridsdorf
	office. This is Herr Mueller, Herr
	Junker, and Herr Frosch.
	Heil Hitler.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler.
	Heil Hitler.
	MUELLER
	Heil Hitler.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler.
	JUNKER
	Heil Hitler.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler.
	FROSCH
	Heil Hitler.
	DEERTZ
	Now, we--
	KLENZENDORF (O.S.)
	Sorry I’m late, my bicycle got a flat
	tire. I carried it.
	DEERTZ
	Ah, Klenzendorf. Heil Hitler.
	KLENZENDORF
	Heil Hitler.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler...
	KLENZENDORF
	Yes Johannes, we’ve Heil Hitler’d you
	already.
	So, did I miss anything?
	DEERTZ
	No, we were just Heil Hitlering each
	other and were about to ransack the
	house.
	So, young Jojo, We hear you have been
	helping out at the Hitlerjugend
	office.
	JOJO
	Yes.
	DEERTZ
	Good for you. I wish more of our
	citizens had your commitment.
	KLENZENDORF
	Johannes is a fantastic volunteer.
	He’s very imaginative.
	DEERTZ
	Your room?
	Nice drawings! Wow, look at this.
	He points at a drawing of David killing Goliath.
	This kid is killing a giant. You see
	this Klenzendorf?
	KLENZENDORF
	Yes, these are well executed. Did you
	know I also draw? I have better
	perspective and shading too.
	DEERTZ
	I see someone vandalised your house.
	The front door.
	JOJO
	Children.
	DEERTZ
	Children?! The brats! What is this
	world coming to? What did it say? It
	has almost been washed away.
	JOJO
	I don’t know. A number.
	DEERTZ
	A number? You know what it means?
	JOJO
	No.
	DEERTZ
	Oh, that’s a shame.
	What on earth are those oafs up to?
	Why don’t we go upstairs and see. Yes?
	DEERTZ
	Do you know where your mother is?
	JOJO
	No. I think she’s in town.
	DEERTZ
	Is she? Hm.
	Well it’s good to see you are still
	wearing your Jugend uniform.
	But... where is your DJ knife?
	ELSA (O.S.)
	It’s here.
	DEERTZ
	And who might you be?
	ELSA
	Who might YOU be? And what are you
	doing in my house?
	DEERTZ
	You live here too?
	JOJO
	This... is...
	ELSA
	Thisss... isssss...
	Speak properly idiot. You’ll have to
	excuse my heavily retarded brother,
	I’m Inga Betzler.
	There is an awkward pause. Klenzendorf COUGHS. Jojo tries to
	stall.
	JOJO
	Heil Hitler.
	ELSA
	Heil. Hitler.
	DEERTZ
	Heil Hitler.
	I didn’t know you had a sister,
	Johannes.
	ELSA
	Well sometimes he’d prefer I was dead.
	Wouldn’t you, little Frankenstein?
	DEERTZ
	Now, now, no need to attack his
	physicality. It’s a war wound.
	ELSA
	I’ll speak to him how I like. Besides,
	it isn’t a war wound, he was born like
	that.
	DEERTZ
	And why do you have his knife?
	ELSA
	I’m guarding my room because he
	refuses to stay out of it.
	DEERTZ
	What do you have hidden in there?
	ELSA
	Oh you know, girl’s stuff.
	DEERTZ
	May I?
	ELSA
	Naturally.
	DEERTZ
	You see we deal with an overwhelming
	number of reports, denunciations, and
	general investigations which means we
	are severely understaffed and
	overworked.
	Now, of course we are indeed
	interested in problems of crime and
	anti-party sentiment, but we still
	have one greater concern; that of the
	Goldilocksies, running around out
	there taking advantage of other people
	in this city. Sneaking around, taking
	things, eating people’s food, wearing
	their clothes... It’s simply rude.
	I don’t suppose we could see your
	papers could I?
	Hmm?
	KLENZENDORF
	Papers! Quick, we don’t have all day.
	He holds out his hand.
	ELSA
	Yes, of course.
	KLENZENDORF
	How old are you in this photo?
	ELSA
	They’re 3 years old, I was 12.
	Date of birth?
	ELSA
	May 1, 1929.
	KLENZENDORF
	Correct.
	Thank you Inga. Get a new photo.
	DEERTZ
	Good good. Well, we’ll be borrowing
	some of these little things if you
	don’t mind. Nice meeting you.
	ELSA
	Heil Hitler.
	DEERTZ
	As usual, call us if you notice
	anything suspicious.
	KLENZENDORF
	Listen Johannes, we are scaling down
	our operations at the Jugend office so
	there’s not really any work for you
	right now. Your services are no longer
	required.
	Take care Jojo. Stay home. Look after
	yourself.
	JOJO
	Elsa, you fooled them. Elsa?
	ELSA
	May 7.
	JOJO
	What?
	ELSA
	She was born May 7, not the first.
	They’ll be back. They’ll find out
	she’s dead. Then I’ll be dead. I have
	to leave here. I have to get out.
	JOJO
	No. He’s helping us. Either way no one
	will know. I’ve seen the Records Room,
	it’s a complete mess. They won’t
	bother.
	ELSA
	They always bother.
	JOJO
	They won’t. Nobody really knows she
	died. You can be her Elsa. It’s okay,
	I’ll tell mama I know about you and
	that we’retreatsre friends...
	ELSA
	Jew and Nazi are not friends.
	ADOLF
	Mmm, lecker soup.
	JOJO
	It’s just hot water, you don’t need to
	stir it.
	ADOLF
	Fine.
	So that was pretty much a bust. I
	can’t believe they fell for her
	disguise. Mind explaining that?
	JOJO
	I don’t want to talk about it.
	ADOLF
	Well I’m not a mind reader Jojo.
	Actually I am, it’s one of my
	abilities. But I still can’t work out
	what’s going on here.
	JOJO
	Nothing. I just, I’m confused and
	tired.
	ADOLF
	Ewwwwwww, tired. Widdle Jojo’s tired,
	and a widdle bit confused. Ewww, poor
	Jojo, and he’s a widdle bit hungwy and
	the only thing he can cook is this
	invisible soup. Ooh, can I get you
	some invisible soup Jojo?
	Ewwww, I’m eating invisible soup
	because there’s no more food. I’ll eat
	anything, even ants. Ewwww, and now
	I’m a robot anteater.
	Ooh, where’s all the ants? I only eat
	ants. Must eat ants.
	Okay? To clarify: Get your shit
	together and sort out your priorities.
	You’re ten, Jojo. Start acting like
	it.
	ELSA
	Jojo?
	Jojo, stop!
	JOJO
	Mama...
	JOJO
	She was with others. They had a number
	on them.
	ELSA
	O5.
	The Resistance, Jojo. O-Five. The ‘O’
	stands for Oesterreich, Austria. The 5
	is the fifth letter of the alphabet,
	‘E’. Together it makes “OE”, the way
	we used to spell Austria before the
	Nazi regime. “Oesterreich”. She was
	part of this.
	JOJO
	Did you know this before?
	ELSA
	Sort of. She didn’t tell me much, only
	that she worked with friends and that
	your father was somehow involved from
	afar.
	JOJO
	What? No, he’s fighting in the war.
	ELSA
	She didn’t want to tell you anything
	for obvious reasons.
	JOJO
	Because I’m a Nazi.
	ELSA
	No, because she didn’t want you to
	know anything that would get you in
	trouble. She wanted to protect you,
	more than anything, more than me. You
	were the most important thing to her.
	JOJO
	But they found out what she was doing
	in the end. They got her.
	ELSA
	Jojo, I’m sorry. She died trying to
	save lives. That is the greatest
	honour any human can achieve.
	JOJO
	But now I have nothing. No one.
	ELSA
	The last time I saw my parents was at
	Westbanhof. They were put on a train,
	my cousin made me run with him and
	hide behind the terminus. Later we
	were sleeping in the forest, others
	were there. They found us. They shot
	everyone, Franz too. I ran and slowly
	found my way back to the city. A
	friend of my fathers hid me. Then
	another friend, then friends of
	friends... till she took me in.
	So far I am still here. But my parents
	went to a place you don’t come back
	from.
	JOJO
	Please don’t leave.
	She smiles.
	ELSA
	Where would I go? As long as they’re
	out there I will stay here.
	JOJO
	New works by Elsa Korr. Reviewed by
	Mr. Smith...son...stein...berg.
	They’re Jewish; the gallery is in New
	York.
	I had the pleasure of seeing some
	really great drawings by a young girl
	from Austria named Elsa Korr. She
	certainly has an eye for detail; her
	pictures of butterflies are
	incredible. And I loved the drawing of
	the man riding a giraffe. But what
	really stood out was the one of the
	interesting little boy. It made me
	wonder a lot about him and what he was
	thinking about because he looked like
	he was thinking about stuff. Overall
	it was a great collection and I see a
	bright future for this girl, wherever
	she is. I encourage her to keep going
	with the drawings.
	Four out of five stars.
	ELSA
	Wow, that’s pretty positive.
	JOJO
	Yeah.
	They want to do another exhibition in
	June so give me some more drawings and
	I’ll send them off.
	ELSA
	Thanks, Gertrude Stein.
	JOJO
	Yorki!
	YORKI
	Shit! Jojo, you okay?! I’m so clumsy.
	JOJO
	Yorki, what’s going on?
	YORKI
	The Russians Jojo, they’re coming. And
	the Americans from the other way. And
	England and China and Africa and India
	and Australia. Shit, it’s everyone!
	JOJO
	How are we doing?
	YORKI
	Are you kidding? Terribly! Our only
	friends are the Japanese and just
	between you and me, they don’t look
	very Aryan. The whole country’s run
	out of money. I mean look at this
	uniform, it really IS made of paper.
	They just glued a layer thin cotton
	over the top of it.
	You’re lucky you got out, this is
	crazy. Go and hide, buddy.
	Shit, and someone should tell you how
	heavy guns and bullets are.
	JOJO
	What’s it like out there?
	YORKI
	Ummm... shitty. It’s fun at first but
	then it’s really scary. Hans, that big
	asshole from Jungvolk training, he got
	killed about a week ago. His head got
	shot off. I saw it - SHOT OFF! And he
	was still standing holding his gun and
	then he did a little dance like this.
	I know you’re not supposed to laugh
	but it looked so funny. Plus he was
	such an asshole.
	I gotta go.
	JOJO
	Take me with you, I can help. I wanna
	be part of it!
	YORKI
	Why? We’re losing.
	JOJO
	No we’re not. We can’t lose, it’s
	impossible. We’re German. We don’t
	know how to lose, we’re invincible.
	YORKI
	Tell that to old Hans “No more head”.
	Ok, come. I gotta get this ammo to the
	gunners. You can help me.
	YORKI
	Woah, listen, they’re getting closer.
	JOJO
	Remember that Jew I told you about?
	YORKI
	Oh yeah. You caught one.
	JOJO
	I still have her. She’s basically my
	girlfriend.
	YORKI
	Good for you Jojo! A girlfriend!
	JOJO
	But she’s, y’know... Jewish.
	YORKI
	There are bigger things to worry about
	than Jews Jojo. That’s the Russians
	out there. They’re worse than anyone.
	We’ve been told they eat babies and
	have sex with dogs. I mean, that’s
	bad, right?
	JOJO
	Sex with dogs?
	YORKI
	Yeah, and the Englishmen do it too. We
	have to stop them before they eat us
	and fuck all our dogs. It’s crazy.
	Wait, what’s that annoying music?
	Okay, I gotta go Jojo, the guys need
	these bullets.
	JOJO
	We were born to die for Germany.
	YORKI
	Yeah? Well I’m still not gonna laugh
	when they shoot me.
	Shit, I’m a pretty big target too.
	Yorki, you’re my best friend!
	JOJO
	What’s happening?
	WOMAN
	It’s over! The war is over! We will
	have peace!
	JOJO
	What do you mean?
	WOMAN
	The Allies have won. The war is over!
	Americaaaaa!!! Everyone is free!
	Everyone is free!
	ADOLF
	I have no idea what’s going on but I
	do like the little flags and the
	parade.
	JOJO
	Wha-? Adolf the war is over, what now?
	We lost!
	ADOLF
	Good. That means your stupid freeloading girlfriend can finally go away
	to Paris with Nathan. Then it’ll just
	be you and me like normal.
	That’s what we want, right?
	No more girl in the attic! No more
	girl in the attic! Yayyy!
	ELSA
	Jojo! What’s happening out there?
	JOJO
	Hmm? Where?
	ELSA
	Out there dummy! Listen.
	JOJO
	Oh, I’m not sure. Celebrations?
	ELSA
	For what?
	For what, Jojo? Tell me...
	Wait... is it over?
	The war is over?!
	Yes!!! It’s over!!!
	Come, we must go outside! Come on
	Jojo! We are free! I can go home! I
	can go!
	JOJO
	You can’t go.
	ELSA
	What, why? What’s wrong?
	Jojo?
	Who won...?
	Jojo, who won the war?
	JOJO
	We did.
	Hitler won the war.
	ELSA
	But, they said the Allies were going
	to win.
	Congratulations.
	JOJO
	I’m sorry.
	But you can still stay here.
	That’s one good thing. You’ll live
	with me. Here.
	ELSA
	Yes. And I’ll die here too. In this
	room, just like Inga.
	JOJO
	No. I will look after you.
	ELSA
	Or they will come and find me and do
	it themselves.
	JOJO
	No they won’t.
	ELSA
	They’re going to get me.
	JOJO
	I’ll take care of you!
	ELSA
	You can’t take care of anything! Not
	even yourself. You’re a monster like
	all of the others! Monster!!!
	RUSSIAN TEACHER
	What else do we know about the German
	Nazis? Hmm? They are also HEARTLESS.
	Now, you beautiful children are not
	like these Germans, you will learn to
	be better Germans, ok? More like the
	Russians.
	Because Germans are bad people, they
	do very bad things. They have very bad
	taste in art and music, they have bad
	hearts. Now, you need to learn how to
	be better Germans. Who wants to be
	better Germans?
	ADOLF
	I want to be a better German! Pick me!
	Put your hand up! Don’t you want to be
	better?
	RUSSIAN TEACHER
	Wunderbarrr! Now. Come and collect
	some of these silly old German books.
	We’re going to tear them to a million
	pieces!
	FRAULEIN RAHM
	No... I... I was helping them. I was
	good to the Jews. Please, someone tell
	them, I helped them!
	JOJO
	Captain K.
	KLENZENDORF
	Heya kid. Look at all this commotion,
	huh?
	JOJO
	What’s going on?
	KLENZENDORF
	Not much. My dear Finkel is dead.
	JOJO
	Sorry.
	KLENZENDORF
	Mm, I was quite fond of him.
	Wow, now is not a good time to be
	dressed like a Nazi.
	Hey, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I
	think your book is really great. I’m
	sorry for laughing at it. There’s some
	very important stuff in there. You
	should publish it.
	PARTISAN
	You know each other?
	JOJO
	Him. Yes.
	PARTISAN
	How?
	How do you know him? He is Nazi. A
	Nazi yes?
	JOJO
	No, he’s... He helped...
	PARTISAN
	Nazi.
	JOJO
	No, he’s just a...
	PARTISAN
	You know the ugly boy?
	KLENZENDORF
	Oh, I’ve seen him round but I don’t
	know him. Go away little boy.
	PARTISAN
	Yeah, go away ugly little gypsy. Scat!
	YORKI
	Jojo!
	JOJO
	Yorki! I thought you were surely dead.
	YORKI
	No, I can never die! I fell in a hole
	and luckily I’m a little bit fat so I
	got stuck. Anyway, a tank parked over
	the top of my hole and then that got
	blown up and it was a whole 2 days
	before anyone found me.
	JOJO
	I’m glad they did.
	YORKI
	Me too. I lost three Pounds!
	Did you hear? About Hitler?
	JOJO
	What?
	YORKI
	He’s dead. They say he killed himself.
	JOJO
	Bullshit. He wouldn’t.
	YORKI
	He did. He was in a bunker and the
	Russians were all outside and he had
	nowhere to run and so he did it. He
	just blew his brains out. All over the
	wall.
	JOJO
	He blew his brains out?
	YORKI
	All over the wall. Brains everywhere.
	Betrayed us all. Turns out he was
	hiding a lot of stuff from us. Doing
	some really bad things behind
	everyone’s backs. Especially in the
	“constipation camps”.
	JOJO
	What?
	YORKI
	I don’t really know the details.
	Also... look at this.
	There’s a whole section at the postoffice. Did I mention I’m a postman
	now? Anyway, there’s a bunch of
	letters that were confiscated because
	of security stuff but I was snooping
	around and I found them.
	JOJO
	They’re from my father.
	This one is from last week. He’s been
	in Switzerland.
	I guess he was a deserter after all.
	YORKI
	That’s ok, I would have too if I had
	known what it was like.
	JOJO
	Can I come and stay at your place for
	a while? Until my dad comes home?
	YORKI
	Sure. That’s probably a good idea,
	they’re sending orphans to Hungary.
	That’s bad, I heard Hungarians bathe
	in human blood. Dracula’s from
	somewhere round there so it makes
	sense. Yeah, come and stay. You can be
	my brother.
	JOJO
	I’d like that.
	I’m not alone.
	JOJO
	I managed to find another letter for
	you at the post office. It’s from
	Nathan.
	Dear Elsa, I hope you aren’t too sad
	about the result of the war. Oh well.
	But it’s not the end of the world.
	There are still small areas on Earth
	where it’s ok not to be a Nazi so
	please stay alive. Thank God you have
	your good friend Johannes to look
	after you. He really is a fabulous
	person, so brave.
	Soooo very brave. It is important that
	you stay alive and healthy until I
	find you. So eat food, including
	sandwiches, if there are any. I love
	you, Nathan.
	ELSA
	Hi.
	JOJO
	Hi.
	ELSA
	He’s dead.
	JOJO
	Um, pardon?
	ELSA
	Nathan.
	Last winter. Tuberculosis.
	JOJO
	But then who wrote this...?
	ELSA
	Thank you, kind Jojo. You see, I was
	right. You are not one of them.
	How’s it going out there?
	JOJO
	Okay. How’s it going in there?
	ELSA
	Fabulous.
	JOJO
	We’re friends, right?
	ELSA
	I’m not sure we’re allowed to be,
	remember the rules.
	JOJO
	I know but, I think it’s ok if no one
	knows. I don’t mind hanging out with
	you.
	ELSA
	I don’t mind hanging out with you
	either.
	JOJO
	And if we’re friends you trust me,
	right?
	ELSA
	It depends.
	JOJO
	Well, what if I told you I found a way
	to escape Nazi Germany?
	ELSA
	What do you mean?
	JOJO
	I’ve found a way for you to be free.
	ELSA
	Yes, me too. I’m going to kill myself.
	JOJO
	Exactly. Wait. No! Not that!
	ELSA
	Jojo, there’s no point in going on.
	There is no place for me anymore.
	JOJO
	Look, it’s like Nathan said in my fake
	letter from him. There are still Nazifree places. I can make it happen, I
	know a secret way out.
	But you have to trust me and we can’t
	delay. Get your things together, we
	leave in an hour.
	ELSA
	Why don’t we wait till night?
	JOJO
	Are you crazy? Night is when they
	expect us to make a move. Look, I
	don’t try and tell you how to do art
	or poems, do I? No. So please leave
	the escape plans up to me. We’ll be
	fine. The key is to blend in.
	ELSA
	You think the suit helps?
	ADOLF (O.S.)
	I’m not sure what’s going on with us.
	I mean, what you’re doing right now,
	I’m not comfortable with it.
	JOJO
	I don’t think we should hang out
	anymore.
	ADOLF
	Okayyy, that was out of the blue.
	JOJO
	I can’t be your friend anymore.
	ADOLF
	Wow, don’t hold back.
	Very mature.
	He lights another.
	I gotta say, I’m pretty disappointed.
	JOJO
	You lied to me. You lied to everyone
	and then you blew your brains out.
	ADOLF
	Brains are very overrated my friend.
	JOJO
	You ran away. You’re a coward.
	ADOLF
	That’s a big accusation young man.
	Blowing your brains out is actually a
	pretty gutsy thing to do. I’d like to
	see you try it.
	JOJO
	I wouldn’t. And would you mind
	explaining the constipation camps?
	ADOLF
	Constellation camps. We encourage
	people to Stargaze.
	JOJO
	Liar.
	ADOLF
	Okay, okay, I get it, you wanna go
	your own way, maybe start a Fourth
	Reich or something. Fine. But you know
	what, you let me down too so now we’re
	even.
	JOJO
	Even?! How? I believed in you!
	ADOLF
	Yeah well, you stopped believing.
	What’s more you missed my birthday
	which was just last week and you ended
	up making friends with that thing
	upstairs.
	JOJO
	That thing is a little girl.
	ADOLF
	Says who?
	110.
	JOJO
	Says anyone who’s ever met a little
	girl before!
	ADOLF
	Well excuse me for not knowing any
	little girls.
	You’re in love with her, aren’t you!
	JOJO
	Yes, I am.
	ADOLF
	Admit it!
	JOJO
	I said yes.
	ADOLF
	I knew it. Well, she’s too old for
	you. You don’t stand a chance.
	JOJO
	If I were bigger and more agile I’d
	kick your damn head off.
	ADOLF
	Okay look, I’m sorry things didn’t
	work out with us. But y’know, we’re
	more alike than you think. I’m still
	quite proud of you. Intensely
	disappointed but also proud.
	I now like to think of you as my
	strange, wayward, ugly son.
	JOJO
	I’m not your son. I’ve already got a
	dad and he’s coming home.
	ADOLF
	What about having two dads?
	JOJO
	I just want the one!
	ADOLF
	Good luck little Jojo Rabbit. I’ll see
	you round the traps.
	Before I go, could I give you a little
	bit of advice?
	JOJO
	No. Fuck off, Hitler.
	JOJO
	Ready?
	Elsa nods.
	ELSA
	Is it dangerous?
	JOJO
	Extremely.
	JOJO
	Yes...
	We made it.
