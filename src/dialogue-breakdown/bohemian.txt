	JIM HUTTON (O.S.)
	Freddie!
	MARY
	Freddie?! Oh no, oh no!
	BBC ANCHORMAN
	Tragic news today--for fans of the
	Super-group Queen--that Freddie
	Mercury, their iconic and renown
	frontman...
	JAPANESE ANCHOR (O.S.)
	...rokkusuta, Freddie Mercury...
	GERMAN ANCHOR (O.S.)
	...rock Gott, Freddie Mercury...
	SPANISH ANCHOR (O.S.)
	...súper-cantante...
	INDIAN ANCHOR (O.S.)
	...gayaka--Freddie Mercury -
	US ANCHOR
	- died today, in his home, in London.

	But while popular around the globe,
	not everyone approved of the man, who
	became synonymous with excess...
	ROGER
	“a man--bent--on abnormal pleasures,
	corrupt, corrupting--his life a
	revolting tale of depravity, lust
	and wickedness...”
	BRIAN
	No.
	ROGER
	“...for his kind his death--was a
	suicide.” Bastards.
	BRIAN
	What do you want to do?
	INTERVIEWER
	Last week saw the death of one of the
	most flamboyant and popular figures in
	rock-music--Freddie Mercury, lead
	singer with Queen. Joining us in the
	studio to pay tribute and maybe
	reflect on Freddie’s memory for the
	first time: two of the band members:
	guitarist Brian May & drummer Roger
	Taylor--thanks for coming. So--
	the commentators have all had their
	say about Freddie, haven’t they?
	ROGER
	What we feel is--our friend is barely
	in his grave--all he ever did was try
	to entertain people--and some people
	are saying “good”, “good riddance”,
	“he deserved it.” It’s disgusting.
	Because he was actually -
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	(Yes, I mean) it would be wrong not to
	say that he has been depicted in
	certain quarters as a sort of
	decadent, wild, bisexual,
	irresponsible lover.
	ROGER
	We’re here to stick up for him, coz
	he can’t stick up for himself.
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	But what was the truth of that?
	BRIAN
	Of what?
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	Was he decadent, irresponsible? When
	you hear the stories -
	BRIAN
	Did he deserve to die, you mean? Is
	that the question?
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	But it’s interesting isn’t it, that -
	ROGER
	He was a victim of an epidemic. A
	plague. We lost a great artist.
	BRIAN
	And a magnificent human being.
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	And why do you think, then, some
	people are -
	ROGER
	- Newspapers - let’s be clear -
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	- newspapers--the media--have reacted
	in this way? Is it perhaps because -
	ROGER
	Because they have no shame. They want
	to sell papers. They don’t know who
	he was.
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	- because Freddie became a symbol for
	a certain sort of life-style, didn’t
	he? A manifesto of hedonistic freedom.
	BRIAN
	Did he? I don’t know that.
	ROGER
	You asked us on this program so we
	could talk about our friend. We
	agreed that -
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	Well let’s talk about you then, the
	band. What will you do now? Will you
	go on, or disband?
	ROGER
	It’s too soon--it’s been three days
	--we were together 22 years. We’re
	in shock, I think.
	BRIAN
	Yes.
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	Because also, well, Freddie wrote
	most of your hits--didn’t he?
	ROGER
	Did he? Oh.
	BRIAN
	Oh so Freddie wrote: “We Will Rock
	You”--did he?
	ROGER
	“A Kind of Magic”? Coz I thought -
	BRIAN
	“Radio Gaga”? (Oh I see.)
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	(Well let’s just)--just say--a lot
	of your biggest most popular hits...
	ROGER
	No. No, let’s say--”let’s just say”
	this interview is over. Let’s just
	say that.
	MALE INTERVIEWER
	(No, no, please), guys, hey, come on -
	ROGER
	You’re a dick.
	OLDER ROGER
	Brian? BRI!
	OLDER BRIAN
	Mmmmm?
	OLDER ROGER
	I’m out of here. See you tomorrow
	morning. Got some good stuff.
	OLDER ROGER
	Says he’s here for an interview.
	BLOGGER
	“BuzzMix Online”? You both agreed
	to an interview? David Ashcroft.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Buzzmix?
	BLOGGER
	Twelve million followers.
	BLOGGER
	Email confirmation...7 pm. You
	were both “looking forward to it.”
	OLDER BRIAN
	...fucking Jim Beach...
	BLOGGER
	And I fly back to the US tomorrow
	morning, so--this is really the
	only chance. Kinda--now or never.
	OLDER ROGER
	I’m good with never.
	BLOGGER
	Ha! So--it’s No? Really? I can’t
	just get you both--quick interview?
	Flew 11 hours. Hotel. Cabs...
	OLDER ROGER
	I’m helluva late already, sorry.
	Would have loved to, just can’t.
	Shame, I love interviews.
	BLOGGER
	Dr May?
	OLDER ROGER
	Go on Doctor. Just give him--12
	minutes--a million people a minute
	aint bad.
	OLDER BRIAN
	You give him 12 minutes!
	OLDER BRIAN
	I’m working. Sorry. No.
	Can you show yourself out?
	BLOGGER
	Wow. Okay. Okay--alright. Jesus.
	I’ll um--okay...
	BLOGGER
	This is an “Orion”, right?
	OLDER BRIAN
	It’s written on the side.
	OLDER BRIAN
	You’re interested in...(space)?
	BLOGGER
	My Dad, big Night-Sky nut. To prepare
	for this I actually tried to read your
	paper on--Jesus--”The Motion Of Zodiac
	- “
	OLDER BRIAN
	Zodiacal Dust Particles.
	BLOGGER
	- but you kinda lost me when you got
	into the high luminosity of FaberPerrier inter-whatevers.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Fabry-Perot interferomters.
	BLOGGER
	That’s the one. Anyway...
	OLDER BRIAN
	How long will it take - ?
	BLOGGER
	- Not long, not at all! See, as it’s
	the 25th anniversary Of Freddie’s
	passing there’s renewed interest,
	especially with Queen playing again...
	BLOGGER
	...to huge crowds still--and the
	songs, they’ve endured!
	(sings badly)
	“Bismillah, we will not let you go,
	let him go...Bismillah...we will
	not let you go...”
	OLDER BRIAN
	And the press said that song should be
	“sunk to the bottom of the ocean.”
	“The Sun”, newspaper--never forget a
	bad review--nor did Freddie. Oh how
	he hated the critics.
	BLOGGER “Bismillah.” What is that, by the way?
	There’s all these theories out there.
	Did Freddie ever explain it?
	OLDER BRIAN
	Bismillah?
	BLOGGER
	Tell me. You gotta tell me.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Freddie wanted mystery. He needed it,
	you see. Ask me something else.
	BLOGGER
	It’s just I did some research for this
	interview and I googled the TV
	interview you did at the time--wow, I
	mean, horrible! And you clearly wanted
	to tell people who Freddie Mercury
	really was...
	OLDER BRIAN
	And your question?
	BLOGGER
	Just that, really. Who was Freddie
	Mercury? Who was he? If we could
	start there...
	Coz, I read a bunch of stuff about
	him but none of it really made
	me any the wiser...
	OLDER BRIAN
	Freddie?...(Frowns) Hated to talk
	about himself--well, truthfully
	about himself.
	BLOGGER
	Right! But you knew him.
	So--how did you first meet?
	Freddie Mercury? The Legend?
	OLDER BRIAN
	Bulsara. Freddie--Bulsara. I heard him--before I saw him...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	....Me and my bandmate Roger used to
	hang out at Ealing Art School.
	There were some pretty girls there.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Our band was good. But we were having
	problems connecting with audiences -
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	We were even thinking of breaking up
	and going back to our studies...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Roger was studying dentistry at
	the time...
	OLDER BRIAN
	I?--I was in love with...
	OLDER BRIAN
	...the universe--but torn, torn
	between stars -
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	- and stardom.

	FREDDIE
	“Smile”! Yes?
	FREDDIE
	Saw your gig at Imperial College.
	FREDDIE
	You guys are brilliant but no show.
	You need pizzazz, costumes, lights,
	proper front-man...What you need is
	lightning in a bottle! Freddie
	Bulsara. So. What are you toilet
	trolls doing here, with your flies
	open? Gosh, it’s like boarding school!
	FREDDIE
	Alright--fine--”When in England...”
	FREDDIE
	Don’t worry, you’re not the first
	to be speechless.
	ROGER
	Jesus, man -
	FREDDIE
	Oh, did I misunderstand?
	FREDDIE
	Okay--let’s wait till “lights
	out” when “Sir” is asleep...
	TIM STAFFEL
	“Humpy Bong.”
	BRIAN
	Humpy Bong?
	TIM STAFFEL
	They're going places. Gonna be big.
	ROGER
	Humpy Bong--are gonna be big?
	BRIAN
	Don't do it, Tim.
	TIM STAFFEL
	Sorry guys. Gotta look after myself.
	ROGER
	What now?
	FREDDIE
	Listen to this! Hear how the guitar
	starts here (left speaker)--here-herehere!--and now comes over here! (right
	speaker) How does he make it do that?
	BRIAN
	Studio. They split stereo sound, two
	channels, left and right, pan back and
	forth...
	BRIAN
	What’s with all the paper balls?
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	“Outcast”--Yes, that’s how he’d
	always seen himself. A sad, lonely
	boy, bullied--tugged from Africa
	to India to this place--this
	little room in Feltham, Middlesex!
	FREDDIE
	One has to suffer for fashion.
	BRIAN
	You write songs?
	FREDDIE
	No. That’s why they’re paper balls.
	Can’t finish them.
	FREDDIE’S MUM (O.S.)
	FREDDIE!
	FREDDIE (O.S.)
	I move into my first flat next week
	thank God. Smaller than this room,
	but we can hang out, play music...
	Coming Ma!
	Mind if I make a suggestion about
	our playlist on Friday?
	BRIAN
	It’s only a trial gig, just to see if
	you gel with the band - okay?
	FREDDIE (O.S.)
	Coming!
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Here was his music. I’d never seen
	notation like it. It was--different.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Not at all proper. But a language
	that was Freddie’s own--a
	kaleidoscope of influences--a nod to
	one style, a genuflection to another--
	melodies battling with countermelodies...
	OLDER BRIAN
	...rock competing with “Uncle Mack’s
	Children’s Favourites”, competing with
	Mantovani--the Laughing Policeman with
	Verdi and the Billy Goats Gruff. And
	what I saw, in these little bits of
	paper, this confetti - was a man's
	confusion--in musical form--about who
	he was! A many of strange parts. And
	such--cacophany!
	OLDER BRIAN
	And what could I do for him? Connect
	them all, help him to tie them
	together, to produce...harmony.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Let me show you! In those days--he
	was writing things--like this...
	OLDER BRIAN
	...but he only had the first 8 bars
	...but what 8 bars! Catchy...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Just this riff--classical almost--
	a 5-Finger-Exercise...
	OLDER BRIAN
	...repeating--all he had--and he
	asked me “What goes now?”
	And I said...I said “It goes -
	OLDER BRIAN
	MASSIVE...three guitars in harmony!
	Guitars transformed into an
	orchestra! I could give him what
	he was hearing but couldn’t play.
	OLDER BRIAN
	And then we’re in.
	BLOGGER
	The "Red Special”? That’s it?
	Your father made it for you?
	OLDER BRIAN
	This?
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	We had no idea what to expect from
	Freddie on that first night.
	OLDER BRIAN
	And John Deacon, electrical
	engineering student, had just taken
	over on bass--so anything could
	happen.
	ROGER
	Ready? Freddie?
	FREDDIE
	Ready Steady Go.
	Wait, wait--This--give me---Bloody-
	ROGER
	Come on.
	BRIAN
	Freddie -
	FREDDIE
	Fuck it. Let’s go.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Same old song, but it sure felt
	different with Freddie doing it.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	...and it needed a new look.
	BRIAN
	This is Freddie.
	FREDDIE
	How do you do?
	BRIAN
	Mary. Mary Austin.
	FREDDIE
	Mary.
	MARY
	Freddie.
	MARY
	So how do you know Brian?
	FREDDIE
	I’m his new lead singer.
	BRIAN nods.
	MARY
	Oh yeah?
	FREDDIE
	Details! She’s your girlfriend?
	Not your girlfriend? What? C’mon.
	BRIAN
	Sort of.
	FREDDIE
	Sort of Yes, or sort of No?
	BRIAN
	Sort of--both. We’ve been out a few
	times. It was -
	FREDDIE
	Kissed her?
	BRIAN
	Cheek only. Look, if you like her--
	then just--she’s had a rough time with
	guys. Needs someone to appreciate her.
	FREDDIE
	There’s something really sweet and
	calming about her.
	BRIAN
	Go on then--ask her out.
	MARY
	Closing.
	Find anything?
	FREDDIE
	Might need something...louder.
	MARY
	You really like clothes.
	FREDDIE
	Fashion & Design, Ealing Arts.
	Can’t you tell?
	MARY
	I can now. Yes.
	FREDDIE
	So--right. See you. Some other time.
	He leaves, but then returns -
	FREDDIE
	It’s some other time.
	MARY
	“Smile”.
	ROGER
	If we could find a customer.
	MARY
	I just had people in the store talking
	about this wild new band. It’s going
	well.
	And who might this be?
	FREDDIE
	Countessa! Might I perchance interest
	you in my bric a brac? A portrait
	perhaps of our Saviour, James Hendrix
	rendered by own hand?
	MARY
	Actually, I was looking for Fred.
	FREDDIE
	Fred?
	ROGER
	Could you describe him?
	MARY
	With some difficulty.
	FREDDIE
	“He’s so nervous...but he’s at your
	service...”
	MARY
	Hello
	FREDDIE
	Hello.
	FREDDIE
	Rightio. We need to stop by a
	chemist and buy some
	nail-polish immediately.
	MARY
	Why?
	FREDDIE
	Why do you think?
	FREDDIE
	Let's make the poor little thing
	stand out...transform it, from
	being just another sad, completely
	forgettable, run of the mill...
	two-a-penny...humdrum...
	MARY
	...garden variety...
	FREDDIE
	...bog-standard...
	MARY
	...middle of the road...
	FREDDIE
	...a So-So piano--and make it
	one-of-a-kind. Famous among pianos.
	MARY
	Famous among pianos?
	FREDDIE
	There.
	MARY
	Oh.
	FREDDIE
	Oh.
	FREDDIE
	So what are your parents like?
	MARY
	That tickles!
	FREDDIE
	Completely normal I suppose?
	MARY
	Garden Variety. Freddie!
	FREDDIE
	Run Of The Mill? 
	MARY
	Two. A-penny.
	FREDDIE
	They’re deaf and mute?
	MARY
	(to FREDDIE)
	I just told them your life story.
	Well, the little I know of it!
	FREDDIE
	Tell them it’s nice to meet them.
	MARY
	I have.
	FREDDIE
	Okay. Then, uh--thank them for
	the delicious food.
	MARY
	I have.
	FREDDIE
	Then--I dunno, then tell them their
	daughter is a tremendous fuck.
	MARY
	They can lip read.
	FREDDIE
	You’re joking?
	MARY
	Uh-uh.
	FREDDIE
	Oh God.
	FREDDIE
	Great food.
	FREDDIE
	Dearie! Still in bed? Perfect. Stay
	right -
	FREDDIE
	- where - you are.
	MARY
	I loathe that you’ve started smoking.
	FREDDIE
	I need more gravel in my voice. The
	top guys now all sound asthmatic.
	FREDDIE
	Why is my hair always greasy?
	MARY
	It’s not. I need to get up.
	FREDDIE
	No. The new rule for our new life
	together: we have to make love at
	least four times a day whether we want
	to or not. And this number
	can be changed, but only increased.
	FREDDIE
	And you will want to, won’t you?
	You’ll always want to?
	MARY
	Always? Probably.
	FREDDIE
	Probably?! You little Nun! You
	little convent Nun!
	MARY
	Are all men as -
	FREDDIE
	- as what?
	MARY
	Your libido is -
	FREDDIE
	- We’re lucky, aren’t we? It’s just
	a gift we both have to be grateful
	for. It astonishes me too.
	FREDDIE
	Wait!
	MARY
	What? What is it?
	FREDDIE
	Wait. Wait...
	FREDDIE
	What do you think?
	MARY
	Freddie!
	FREDDIE
	It’s good, don’t you think?! I’m
	writing a song. If Brian and Roger can
	do it I should be able to. And this
	tune keeps going round and round and
	round in my head- Bom Bom...
	Bom,Bom,Bom,Bom...but I can’t finish
	it. Do you think it has potential?
	MARY
	Freddie -
	FREDDIE
	How beautiful you are.
	MARY
	Freddie! You’re awful!
	FREDDIE
	Wait, wait, wait--what do you think
	of it? It’s charming, don’t you
	think? It’s like a cowboy song.
	MARY
	I give up!
	FREDDIE
	Mary! Come back here this instant!
	FREDDIE
	Mary?!
	FREDDIE
	Hmmm-Hmmm....Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm
	Mary?
	“Mama”...Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm.
	FREDDIE
	Mary?! Uh Oh! It’s happening again!
	MARY (O.S.)
	Use the bathroom!
	He gets out of bed, adjusting himself -
	FREDDIE
	The bathroom?!! The bathroom?!!
	MARY
	Stay away! Freddie! Arrhh! Stay away!
	Help! Help!
	FREDDIE
	Ma! None of that old stuff!
	FREDDIE’S MUM
	What?
	MARY
	Farrokh?
	FREDDIE’S MUM
	His father and I are Indian Parsees.
	FREDDIE
	Can we please talk about something
	else? I’m serious!
	MARY
	Fred said you were Persian.
	FREDDIE’S DAD
	A thousand years ago the
	Parsees came out of Persia
	to escape Muslim
	persecution...
	FREDDIE
	La da da da da da da da da
	da dada dadadada...
	KASHMIRA BULSARA
	...and what’s a thousand years
	between friends, right Fred?
	MARY
	Sweet.
	KASHMIRA BULSARA
	What?! What are you so
	embarrassed about?!
	FREDDIE
	Kash! WHY DON’T YOU JUST -
	FREDDIE’S DAD
	Both of you!!!
	KASHMIRA BULSARA
	Freddie was born in England at the
	age of 18.
	FREDDIE’S DAD
	Was a good boxer actually.
	KASHMIRA BULSARA
	He had to be!
	FREDDIE’S DAD
	But his opponents went for his teeth.
	FREDDIE
	“Happy Birthday to Me...Happy
	Birthday to Me...”
	“Happy Birthday Mr Fred-isent,
	Happyyyy...
	“Get Back, Get back, Get back to
	where you once belonged!...’
	“For once in my life I have someone
	who needs me, someone I’ve waited
	so long...”
	KASHMIRA BULSARA
	Elvis! Elvis!
	FREDDIE
	“...Was a cold and grey Zanzibarian
	morn, and another little chil’...”
	FREDDIE’S DAD
	Acker Bilk!
	FREDDIE
	Oh shit...umm...uhhh...
	(and then remembers)
	FREDDIE
	There! Concert over.
	FREDDIE’S DAD
	And this is Farrokh at boarding
	school in Bombay...
	KASHMIRA BULSARA
	All on his own. Poor Farrokh -
	FREDDIE
	FREDDIE! My name is Freddie! My
	name--is FREDDIE...MERCURY.
	KASHMIRA BULSARA
	Freddie what?
	FREDDIE
	My stage name. My new stage name.
	FREDDIE’S MUM
	Well you’re not on stage now Farrokh.
	FREDDIE
	Freddie Mercury! I am a professional
	singer and that is now my name from
	now on, anywhere, anytime, even here!
	FREDDIE’S DAD
	You want your own family--to call
	you Freddie Mercury?
	FREDDIE
	From now on.
	FREDDIE’S MUM
	Freddie Mercury? What is this?
	What is wrong with Farrokh? With
	Bulsara?
	FREDDIE
	What’s wrong with it is...
	he doesn’t exist anymore!
	FREDDIE
	I feel like a butterfly!
	ROGER
	I feel like a tosser.
	We’re musicians. We’re not actors.
	FREDDIE
	It’s outrageous--that’s the only way
	the public will realise you’re on the
	scene! Rock has to be a show!
	Look at Hendrix. You saw him perform?
	FREDDIE
	It’s a show! Jimi lets the audience
	in!
	BRIAN
	Muddy Waters just sits in a chair.
	JOHN
	Is breathing allowed?
	FREDDIE
	And the band needs to change its
	name. “SMILE” is limp. We deserve
	something--regal...
	RINK
	You guys finished?
	ROGER
	No. We’ve just started.
	RINK
	Coz they (the skaters) want some
	disco, you know how ‘tis. Do you
	play disco then? No?
	FREDDIE
	I fucking hate disco.
	RINK
	Then if you don’t mind, I’m just
	going to put on some disco records,
	keep ‘em happy, rightio?
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Roger and I continued to write songs,
	but increasingly Fred joined in...
	OLDER BRIAN
	Those first three albums? We had
	small hits. “My Fairy King”.
	Freddie’s. It starts--it starts
	(blows out the match)
	...in descending lines...
	OLDER BRIAN
	But then? I took the reels on
	the tape deck, turned them over,
	played the tape backwards...
	OLDER BRIAN
	You see? “Backwards guitars”...so
	rising now...in three-part harmony...
	...eight bars...then the drums!
	Little Richard suddenly! Jerry Lee!
	Vocal harmonies...
	Bending harmonies--another
	trademark--and then -
	OLDER BRIAN
	- a nursery rhyme! What next?
	FREDDIE’S VOCAL (O.S.)
	“In the land where horses
	born with eagle wings
	And honey bees have lost
	their stings
	There's singing forever...”
	OLDER BRIAN
	(talking the lines)
	“In the land where horses
	born with eagle wings
	And honey bees have lost
	their stings
	There's singing forever...”
	OLDER BRIAN
	We were reaching for something, and we
	didn’t even know what it was.
	BLOGGER
	It got you your first record deal.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Could only afford to record at night.
	BLOGGER (V.O.)
	Small label. Released your first
	three albums...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	And we toured America, as a
	support act for Mott The Hoople
	JOHN
	Freddie! Fuck’s sake!
	FREDDIE
	Listen to me, I love you, yes! I
	miss you sooooo much--yes I do...
	FREDDIE’S VOICE
	...Delilah? Can you hear me,
	sweetheart?
	FREDDIE
	Could they have found a shittier bus?
	Led Zeppelin insist on a plane.
	ROGER
	They’re divas.
	FREDDIE
	Darling, you have to behave like a
	star to be treated like one!
	BRIAN
	M.U.Z.J.I.K.--Musjik.
	ROGER
	What the hell’s that?
	JOHN
	MUSIC when you’re pissed.
	BRIAN
	A Muzjik is a Russian Peasant. And
	with the triple-letter score on the
	Z, you English peasants, that’s
	worth...34, 42...
	FREDDIE
	Is this the most intellectual rockband the world has ever seen?
	JOHN
	Certainly the best spellers.
	BRIAN
	...43, 48 points.
	OLDER BRIAN
	OLDER BRIAN
	...a piece about a prostitute,
	a hymn to hookers...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	...our breakthrough song. Got us on
	UK TV. ”Top Of The Pops”. The biggest
	most popular music show there was.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	We were changing--but Freddie?
	Fred’s was a metamorphosis!
	To the project of being “Freddie
	Mercury”
	he applied all his energy...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	We were growing our audience...
	country by country...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	...Asia.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	...America...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	But for all our hard work, we were
	deep in debt, owed people for
	equipment, broke.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Money--may not buy happiness,
	but it can damn well give it.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	The problem was--our old record deals
	were rigged to make other people
	money...so we switched management...
	JOHN REID
	Let’s change the world.
	JOHN REID
	Paul Prenter--he’ll be assisting
	me with day-to-day.
	RAY FOSTER (O.S.)
	So. A new album?
	JOHN REID (O.S.)
	Their biggest and best yet -
	RAY FOSTER (O.S.)
	And most expensive I presume.
	RAY FOSTER
	Well I need not tell you--that it’s
	make or break time. I think you have
	to agree we have been patient with
	you, hoping for a breakthrough that
	I’m afraid just hasn’t come.
	JOHN REID
	Yet.
	FREDDIE
	I want you to hear something.
	It’s the new concept.
	RAY FOSTER
	It’s--opera.
	FINANCIAL OFFICER
	It’s opera.
	JOHN REID
	Opera.
	ROGER
	Seems to be an echo in here.
	FREDDIE
	Wait!
	FREDDIE
	You see?!
	FREDDIE
	That’s our concept--mix genres, no
	boundaries, dare to go anywhere. I
	can’t think of anyone whose ever done
	that before.
	RAY FOSTER
	Precisely what worries me.
	FREDDIE
	I don’t want us to repeat ourselves.
	The same formula, over and over--How
	boring! We want to capture a
	hurricane! Paint pictures on an
	enormous scale, heavy rock foundation,
	ethereal vocals, different voices,
	rhythms, keys. Deafen ‘em, blind ‘em,
	and leave ‘em wanting more.
	We want to make the greatest fucking
	album ever made.
	RAY FOSTER
	Really? Trouble is, Freddie, that’s
	exactly what every band who comes in
	here says - minus the “fucking”.
	Because it’s our feeling, here at EMI,
	that your biggest success was “Killer
	Queen”, and it’s that we’d like to see
	you get back to.
	FREDDIE
	Go backwards? It’s not in our nature.
	You want us to go back?
	RAY FOSTER
	Not necessarily back, no. You stay
	here, we want you right here--just--
	bring sound...forward.
	FINANCIAL OFFICER 1
	We really need a firm undertaking to
	that effect. John? If we are to take
	the risk one more time.
	JOHN REID
	I understand what you’re saying.
	FEATHERSTONE
	So--we are agreed? An album--in the
	vein of “Killer Queen”? Radiofriendly? Top of The Pops?...Good?
	JOHN REID
	Absolutely.
	JOHN REID
	To your fourth album! Come on guys!
	You got your fourth album!
	PAUL PRENTER
	Fourth album!
	JOHN REID
	We just need 12 great new “Killer
	Queens.” Get writing. All of you.
	FREDDIE
	Boredom--is a disease--the biggest
	disease in the world, darling--and
	we’ve just agreed to spread it!
	Cheers! To Boredom!
	JOHN REID
	Freddie--I’m giving Paul to you.
	Personal assistant. Take some pressure
	off. And keep you out of trouble.
	A good influence.
	FREDDIE
	Oh I have a good influence. I have
	Mary.
	JOHN REID
	You will still have Mary. Now you
	have Paul as well. It’s a gift.
	FREDDIE
	Oh well.
	In hindsight, if there was a moment
	I should have intervened...
	FREDDIE
	I suppose the more the merrier.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	...I was worried but I didn’t have
	the audacity to tell him what to do.
	I said--nothing.
	JOHN REID
	Royalties, profits. How do you want
	to cut up the pie? How have you
	traditionally done that?
	ROGER
	What pie?
	JOHN
	The songwriter--whoever brings a
	song in - even if we all contribute -
	- gets the song-writing credit for
	that song. And if the song gets on
	the album, then that person gets
	the publishing royalties. The rest of
	the band gets -
	ROGER
	- what’s left over.
	JOHN
	Brian, now Freddie, are writing
	most of the songs, so...
	JOHN REID
	And you don’t want to pool the
	money, divide it evenly?
	BRIAN
	I think--we’re good with the
	current arrangement.
	FREDDIE
	It’s working.
	JOHN REID
	Yes? We’re all good? Speak now...?
	Then I’ll draw something up.
	JOHN REID
	You’re happy? Being in a band?
	FREDDIE
	Sure.
	JOHN REID
	Ever think of going solo?
	FREDDIE
	No.
	JOHN REID
	I hope you don’t mind but I need
	you to know something.
	I’m gay.
	FREDDIE
	Really?
	FREDDIE
	Have you told the others?
	JOHN REID
	I think they know.
	People generally do.
	MARY
	What is it?
	FREDDIE
	Go on, open it up!
	MARY
	Oh no.
	FREDDIE
	Getting smaller and smaller, I’m
	afraid. Shrinking and shrinking,
	sorry sweetie.
	MARY
	What is it?
	FREDDIE
	Well it can’t be very big!
	Be more fun if the boxes got bigger
	and bigger, wouldn’t it and you end
	up with a car or something.
	FREDDIE
	Well?
	MARY
	Which hand?
	FREDDIE
	Left hand, fourth finger.
	Her heart stops.
	FREDDIE
	Your turn to say something.
	MARY
	Yes. Of course.
	FREDDIE
	That’s alright then. Isn’t it?
	ROGER
	Nice recording studio.
	JOHN
	Evidently the cheapest EMI could find.
	BRIAN
	The idea was to get away from all
	distractions.
	FREDDIE
	You forgot cow shit and roosters
	at dawn.
	FARMER
	“Queen” I presume?! Welcome! Shall
	we get you settled in then?
	FARMER
	Only two of the rooms have windows!
	ROGER
	Engaged? Congratulations’n all that.
	Ra Ra, very cool.
	FREDDIE
	Surreal you mean. You and Dominique?
	ROGER
	Ah ah ah ah! Every man, in their own
	time, in their own way.
	BLOGGER
	Was there creative conflict? During
	those sessions?
	OLDER BRIAN
	Conflict? No, I don’t think so. No.
	ROGER
	I put my heart and soul into this
	song and you don’t like it because
	you want your songs on the album
	and your royalties as writers--
	that’s why you don’t like it!!!
	FREDDIE
	For God’s sake. It’s not that, Roger
	dear -
	ROGER
	OH REALLY?! THEN WHAT IS IT?!
	BRIAN
	“I’m In Love With My Car”? It’s not
	strong enough.
	ROGER
	Not strong enough?
	BRIAN
	No. John? Fred? Is it strong enough?
	If I’m on my own here...
	ROGER
	How fucking dare you! Oh! How does
	your song go? “You call me
	sweet...like I'm some kind of cheese”
	Fucken Yeats! But did you hear me
	(criticizing) -
	BRIAN
	(No, but you -) No, but you made it
	very clear! Playing your drums out
	of time!
	ROGER
	I never play out of time!
	I can’t play out of time!
	BRIAN
	Way out of time, smashing your highhat -
	ROGER
	Sometimes I could fucking murder you
	May!
	FREDDIE
	Let’s be honest--we could all
	fucking murder each other! (So let’s
	just -)
	BRIAN
	You know why you’re angry? Because
	you know your song isn’t strong
	enough!
	ROGER
	Is that strong enough?!
	ROGER
	That strong enough?!
	BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE/ROY
	Not the coffee machine!
	FREDDIE
	Fuck this.
	FREDDIE
	Oh dear.
	FREDDIE
	Come on Freddie...
	FREDDIE
	How does it go?
	...it goes it goes it goes...
	FREDDIE
	“Mama...I just killed a man - “
	OLDER BRIAN
	- “Put a gun against his head,
	pulled my trigger now he’s dead.”
	Just like that. He’d started it years
	before. You see-
	(leaning forward)
	- he wasn’t ready to finish it then.
	He hadn’t been ready to own up to
	what the song needed to say.
	BLOGGER
	And did it say? What did the song say?
	OLDER BRIAN
	Listen to it!
	FREDDIE
	“Mama, life has just begun and now
	I’ve gone and thrown it all away.
	FREDDIE
	“Mama, oooooooh, Didn't mean to make
	you cry,
	If I'm not back again this time
	tomorrow,
	Carry on, carry on, as if nothing
	really matters.
	FREDDIE
	“Too late, my time has come.
	Sent shivers down my spine,
	Body's aching all the time...
	Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go -
	OLDER BRIAN
	“Gotta leave you all behind and face
	the truth!”
	FREDDIE
	“Mama, oooooooh, I don't wanna die,
	I sometimes wish I'd never been
	born at all.
	BRIAN
	What happens then?
	FREDDIE
	I think that’s where the Opera bit
	comes in.
	OLDER BRIAN
	The Opera bit! Yes, the Opera Bit!
	OLDER BRIAN
	No rock song had so thoroughly changed
	its very nature midway through, as if--
	as if the passion of the sentiment
	couldn’t be contained by the existing
	form and everything had to be
	exploded. It shouldn’t have worked,
	and yet--it was sublime.
	ENGINEER (R.T.BAKER)
	Two. Mark Two--version of “Fred’s--
	Thing.”
	FREDDIE
	Sorry!
	ROGER
	Bit too fast, Fred. It’s okay,
	it’s just a wee bit too fast.
	BRIAN
	“Let the audience in.” Right?
	BRIAN
	Something like that? Fred?
	JOHN
	So, tomorrow--we start on the vocals?
	FREDDIE
	Don’t worry my dears, it’s all in
	here.
	ROGER
	It’s not exactly “Killer Queen”. EMI’s
	gonna have a fucking heart-attack--
	half the album’s gonna be one song.
	FREDDIE
	Serves ‘em right--for telling
	artistes to repeat themselves!
	ROGER (O.S.)
	GALILEO! GALILEO! GALILEO!
	FREDDIE
	Can you go a bit higher?
	ROGER
	Any higher and only dogs’ll
	fucking hear it!
	ROGER
	“GALILEO! GALILEO! GALILEO!”
	Jesus Christ, how many more Galileos?
	ENGINEER
	Freddie wants to do a few more
	overdubs. Gotta tell ya, the tape is
	wearing out, can’t take much more.
	FREDDIE
	But it’s sounding colossal. A few
	more. Let’s do it!
	BRIAN
	“GALILEO! GALILEO! GALILEO! GALILEO!
	GALILEO! GALILEO!”
	Happy?
	Or not?
	RAY FOSTER
	I don’t believe it is the album you
	promised us. Do you? Do you?
	JOHN REID
	It’s a great album, Roy.
	RAY FOSTER
	I think--that what you have made here -
	FINANCIAL OFFICER
	- is the most expensive album ever
	made. That’s official.
	RAY FOSTER
	And as for Bohemian -
	JOE BASTIN
	Rhapsody -
	RAY FOSTER
	What is that? It goes on forever - six
	minutes! Six minutes?
	FREDDIE
	I pity your wife if you think six
	minutes is forever. It’s a rhapsody.
	FINANCIAL OFFICER
	It’s a travesty.
	FREDDIE
	We want to release it as our single.
	RAY FOSTER
	Well, that’s not possible. Anything
	over 3 minutes the radio stations
	won’t program it. And what on earth is
	it about anyway? Scaramouche, Gallileo
	FINANCIAL OFFICER 1
	- Figaro -
	RAY FOSTER
	And all that “ISSMILLER” business--
	”ISHMILLER” -
	FREDDIE
	Bismillah.
	JOE BASTIN
	“Bismillah, they will not let him go”
	RAY FOSTER
	What is that, anyway? “Bismillah”?
	FREDDIE
	It’s nonsense. Doesn’t mean anything.
	JOHN REID
	Actually, I agree. We do need the
	BBC and their format is 3 minutes
	tops. I have to agree with Roy.
	JOHN REID
	I think the single is--”Love Of My
	Life.” It’s slow, but it’s strong.
	JOHN REID
	My job is to turn things around for
	you. “Love of my Life”.
	RAY FOSTER
	Play that one again. Let’s hear that
	one again...
	FREDDIE (O.S.)
	(on the recording)
	“Don't take it away from me, because
	you don't know what it means to me.”
	FREDDIE
	No.
	RAY FOSTER
	No?
	JOE BASTIN
	“You’re My Best Friend”? “Oooh you
	make me live, Oooh you make me live
	now honey...” Stronger?
	FINANCIAL OFFICER
	Or what about, what about “I’m In
	Love With My Car”? An idea.
	ROGER
	No. Bohemian Rhapsody.
	JOHN
	Bo-Rap.
	FREDDIE
	There’s no question.
	RAY FOSTER
	“Love Of My Life”...it’s hardly
	“Killer Queen”, but it may have a
	chance...
	BRIAN
	No!
	ROGER
	No!
	FREDDIE
	Tell me one other band that has done
	an operatic single? You can’t.
	FINANCIAL OFFICER
	My point exactly.
	JOHN
	“MacArthur Park” was seven minutes
	long.
	RAY FOSTER
	It’s the BBC. There’s no way around
	the BBC! So let me be clear!...EMI is
	not--repeat NOT--releasing a six
	minute quasi-operatic dirge comprised
	of nonsense words!
	FREDDIE
	Do you believe our own manager taking
	their side?
	ROGER
	Then let’s promote Bo-Rap ourselves.
	Go on TV, play it live.
	JOHN
	Without the multi-tracking it’ll sound
	crap. Gotta sound huge, or not at all.
	ROGER
	Okay. Alright, then let’s film it
	ourselves, mime it to the recorded
	track, and give the film to TV to
	play.
	BRIAN
	Can we do that?
	JOHN
	Be expensive to film something.
	BRIAN
	How much?
	JOHN
	Have to beg, borrow, steal,
	friends, relations, anyone.
	FREDDIE
	Fucking John Reid.
	JOHN REID
	Paul? Want you to meet Jim,
	Jim Beach, Queen’s lawyer.
	PAUL PRENTER
	John just did an incredible job
	handling a very tricky situation with
	EMI about which single to release.
	JIM BEACH
	I see.
	JOHN REID
	Queen have great, wild ideas but
	they lack any sense of the industry.
	JOHN REID
	what the fuck?!!!!
	FREDDIE
	Don’t you EVER betray us again
	John Reid!!!

	CAMERAMAN
	Camera ready.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Remember, there was no such things
	as Music Videos at that time...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	You appeared live on TV, or not at
	all.
	BRUCE GOWERS
	OK--let me see the Multi-Facet
	Lens, try to make it interesting,
	hold it up...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	It became the first music video of
	all time and paved the way to MTV.
	BRUCE GOWERS
	Thanks. Take it away.
	Okay, standing by--“Bohemian
	Rhapsody”...Cue smoke...
	BRUCE GOWERS
	Roll sound.
	CAMERAMAN
	Rolling.
	BRUCE GOWERS
	Mark it.
	BRUCE GOWERS
	And--roll the track please.
	In 5,4,3,2,1 - Music.
	ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE
	“Is this the real life,
	BRUCE GOWERS
	Standby cross-fade -
	ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE
	- is this just fantasy, caught in a
	landslide, no escape from reality.
	BRUCE GOWERS
	Cross-fade, and up you come.
	ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE
	Open your eyes look up to the skies...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	The video was ground-breaking but no
	station was going to screen it unless
	the song was getting massive radio
	airplay...
	KENNY
	In the studio today, singer Fffrederick Mercury! Freddie--welcome,
	you’ve just recorded your fourth
	album. Can you rr-reveal the title?
	FREDDIE
	A Night At The Opera.
	KENNY
	Oh how marvellous.
	“We love the opera round ‘ere, dun’t
	we Ena?”
	“Yes we do dear.”
	FREDDIE
	One night we were all watching a Marx
	Brothers movie, it was called A Night
	At The Opera, and we all thought “Oh
	that’s rather good”, why don’t we just
	call it that?
	KENNY
	Queen--you’re a very shy bunch,
	really, aren’t you?
	FREDDIE
	Me shy? Yes I am actually. People
	don’t seem to realise. Just because
	I go tearing around on stage, they
	think I should go tearing round
	life--but I don’t really.

	KENNY
	“Bohemian Rrrrhapsody”? Jolly title.
	FREDDIE
	The BBC won’t play it, so EMI
	won’t release it.
	KENNY
	Rotten dogs. Why not?
	FREDDIE
	It’s 6 minutes long.
	KENNY
	Ooooooooooohhhh!
	KENNY
	And that was “Bohemian Rhapsody”
	for the--what was it?--the 13th time
	to-day? Gee wizz, we just lurve that
	little song here at Captial Radio. In
	fact, we love it so much, how ‘bout
	we pppplay it again!
	FREDDIE
	Tried to stop him from playing it.
	So many times! Tse!
	FREDDIE
	Just wouldn’t listen. Must be a
	nightmare to work with.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	With this one album, we became one
	of the biggest bands in the world.
	And that one song? It was the most
	expensive song ever made, at the
	time--and it didn’t win a Grammy -
	that went to...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	...something more deserving. Hell,
	Hendrix, Bob Marley, The Who, and Led
	Zeppelin never won a Grammy either!
	But Bohemian Rhapsody did become the
	third biggest-selling song of all
	time--and is routinely voted the
	greatest song of all time...so...
	in your face Chicago!
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Overnight, we were loved. We wanted
	to repay the fans--with a free
	concert...We played Hyde Park to
	150,000 people.
	BLOGGER
	What was that like? To walk out on
	stage in front of so many people?
	OLDER BRIAN
	What was it like? It was...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	...like nothing else. Energy like you
	couldn’t believe--
	OLDER BRIAN
	A tidal wave of sound, but more than
	that. Of approval. Approbation.
	Validation. A rush of joy. Love!
	Filling your soul and washing away
	your worries, fears, pain, making you
	into something you never dreamed you
	could be.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	When we went over our allotted time?
	The police shut us down but no-one
	would go home. 150,000 people stayed.
	We were suddenly the biggest band in
	the world. Well, we sold tickets
	faster than anyone. We toured like
	people possessed...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	America. 32 dates coast to coast.
	FREDDIE
	Dayyyy---OOOOO!
	JAPANESE CROWD
	Dayyyy---OOOOO!
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Japan. Australia. UK.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Then came South America. No one
	had ever played that part of the
	globe-- but Freddie...
	FREDDIE
	Isn’t this fun, darlings?!
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	...Freddie realised that after the
	World Cup there might be some nice
	little stadiums not being used by
	anyone.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	There were.
	CUT TO:
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	58,000 people. Most couldn’t
	speak English but they could
	sing Freddie’s song.
	FREDDIE
	How long has Brian been going?
	ROGER
	Ahh--’bout five minutes so far.
	FREDDIE
	Fuck it, let’s go shopping.
	PAUL PRENTER
	This is ridiculous.
	STAGE-MANAGER
	Freddie, Roger - it’s ending.
	OLDER BRIAN
	And the parties?!
	Well--I was a married man...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	But there were temptations...
	PAUL PRENTER
	From Freddie, just a little something.
	BLOGGER
	I heard the “Dwarves with trays of
	coke on their heads” didn’t actually
	happen? So it’s true!
	OLDER BRIAN
	It’s hard to know what to believe
	sometimes, even when you were there.
	BRIAN
	It’s so nice to have a quiet
	night for a change.
	OLD BRIAN (V.O.)
	Everything changed--so why wouldn’t
	we? How could we not? It was a dream
	come true. The world seemed to be
	unanimously saying to each of us -
	“Genius!” How could we resist such a
	verdict? We were kids!
	FREDDIE
	Couldn’t resist--always wanted to
	swing on a chandelier.
	OLD BRIAN
	But--the pressure! The expectation,
	night after night, that comes with
	such fame? That, we were not prepared
	for.
	JOHN REID
	Very important gig for us.
	ROGER
	Almost as important as tomorrow
	night’s, and the night after that -
	JOHN
	- and the night after week after month
	after that.
	JOHN REID
	Excuse me--where does it say it would
	be easy?
	Your four cars are waiting outside for
	you.
	BRIAN
	Why four cars?
	JOHN REID
	From now on, you each have separate
	cars and drivers.
	FREDDIE
	My voice is cracking up. I’m a
	baritone pretending to be a soprano.
	I need to rest my voice.
	JOHN REID
	What you need is to stop burning the
	candles at both ends.
	FREDDIE
	But the glow from both ends is so
	divine.
	JOHN REID
	Get showered everyone. Get something
	to eat. Back to the hotel. Sleep. See
	you on plane at 6 am. Don’t get high,
	don’t get drunk, you have a photoshoot at 9 in Berlin, interviews all
	day, arena sound-check at 5, show at
	8. Your next day off?
	November.
	ROGER
	I’m beginning to hate him.
	PAUL PRENTER
	I’ll run your bath.
	FREDDIE
	If I ever get lost, come and find me,
	would you?
	ROGER
	What are you on about?
	FREDDIE
	Really lost.
	BRIAN
	Course.
	FREDDIE
	(intensely)
	Promise me.
	BRIAN
	Sure Fred. You got it.
	ROGER
	Yeah.
	JOHN
	No problem.
	FREDDIE
	My throat, it’s like a vulture’s
	crotch.
	JOHN REID
	Listen to me now. You’ve seen what
	I’ve done for Elton. 4% of all records
	purchased last year? In the world?
	Elton John. Who is his band? Do we
	care? I’m just saying, if you went--
	solo--Freddie Mercury--I guarantee you
	could do even better. Guarantee it.
	FREDDIE
	You’re seriously asking me--to break
	up the band?
	JOHN REID
	I’m telling you what awaits you if
	you go solo.
	FREDDIE
	You’ve seen what happens when we work
	together?
	JOHN REID
	I’ve seen what you do for them.
	FREDDIE
	OK. I’ll go solo.
	JOHN REID
	Yeah?
	FREDDIE
	Yeah.
	JOHN REID
	Yes! Alright! I am so relieved.
	JOHN REID
	Coz I have been having such huge
	problems with that band...I don’t know
	how you’ve put up with it.
	FREDDIE
	Pull over. Pull over.
	FREDDIE
	Get out. Out. Get out, it’s over.
	You’re fired John. You’re gone.
	JOHN REID
	What are you talking about “fired”?
	FREDDIE
	Get out of the car. Get out of the
	car! GET OUT!
	JOHN REID
	Freddie!
	FREDDIE
	out! out!
	EXT. LIMO - NIGHT
	JOHN REID
	Freddie!
	FREDDIE
	We’ll manage ourselves from now on.
	Mr Beach here, you’ll take care of
	the rest, won’t you dear?
	JIM BEACH
	Me?
	FREDDIE
	“Miami” New name for you. You ever
	looked after a band before, Miami?
	Points deducted for hesitation.
	JIM BEACH
	No.
	FREDDIE
	All in favour of Miami here looking
	after us from now on?
	FREDDIE
	This is fun. Who else can we hire or
	fire?
	JOE BASTIN
	What?
	FREDDIE
	Bohemian Rhapsody was “too long”, it
	would “never work as a single”.
	JOE BASTIN
	My sincerest apologies.
	FREDDIE
	Funny--apologies take so long,
	but criticism arrives just like that!
	JOE BASTIN
	But! I still think “Love Of My Life”
	would have been the better choice!
	JOE BASTIN
	Just kidding! Just kidding!
	JOE BASTIN
	We’re all here for you, Freddie.
	PAUL PRENTER
	Tell us about your childhood?
	FREDDIE
	Uh uh uh uh. The future?
	It’s that way! Fuck today, it’s
	tomorrow already.
	JIM BEACH
	Such an enigma.
	FREDDIE
	Oh I hope so. True stardom is the
	absence of detail.
	But the clues are all in my songs.
	They’re all...
	FREDDIE
	...in my...
	PAUL PRENTER
	Here we go. And - Freddie?--just want
	to thank you.
	But FREDDIE’s mind is only on JOE BASTIN -
	PAUL PRENTER
	For keeping me on, you know?--I will
	live and die for you, man. Want you to
	know that. Freddie?
	FREDDIE
	Be back in a second. Paul, look
	after Mary, would you?
	PAUL PRENTER
	Pretty dress.
	Make it yourself?
	MARY
	Oh, not still in bed?! Come on. If
	you come in so late that’s your fault.
	Get up!
	MARY
	Come on! I want your opinion on
	wedding dresses and venues--we have a
	choice of three. Freddie?! Freddie!
	We need to talk about the wedding!
	FREDDIE
	Whose wedding?
	MARY
	That’s it! Up! Now!
	FREDDIE
	Mary! You’re fired. I need to sleep!
	Anyway--I have to save my voice.
	It’s insured for a million dollars.
	MARY
	And it’s still annoying. Now get up
	and tell me what you think...
	...of this. Well?
	MARY
	Say something.
	MARY
	You don’t like it? Freddie?
	MARY
	What is it? What’s going on?
	He holds her hands tenderly, looks at the ENGAGEMENT RING
	on her finger, and then stares into her eyes...
	FREDDIE
	You know me better than anyone.
	I want you at my side for the rest
	of my life. You know that.
	MARY
	Yeah.
	FREDDIE
	You know that. But -
	The truth hits MARY in this moment -
	MARY
	Say it. “But” what?
	FREDDIE
	Mary -
	MARY
	Say it. Say it. Go on. It’s okay.
	Freddie. It’s okay. Go on.
	FREDDIE
	I’m. Bi-sexual.
	MARY
	No. I love you--but you’re
	fucking gay.
	FREDDIE
	It’s the Kimono?
	MARY
	I’m such an idiot! So stupid!
	FREDDIE
	Mary--come on.
	MARY
	I deserve this, I deserve it!
	FREDDIE
	You don’t deserve this!
	MARY
	Oh but I do! It’s what I’ve always
	settled for...”I love you, but -”, “I
	love you, but I’ve met someone else”,
	“I love you, but I need some space”...
	“I love you...but I’m gay!”--that tops
	them all, that’s the toughest, because
	it’s not your fault, not at all...it’s
	mine, all mine, and that’s why I
	deserve to be alone.
	FREDDIE
	We’re all fucking alone. Everyone’s
	alone!
	MARY
	I wanted children with you.
	I could see our children--I could
	see our children Freddie!
	Your brown skin...little buck teeth...
	MARY
	I totally understand why people
	kill themselves. It’s too much.
	Oh I can’t breath. I have to breath.
	Isn’t that ironic? I have to breath
	even when I don’t want to?
	FREDDIE
	Baby, darling--we have each other, in
	the most important way. We love each
	other. Without end. To the end. Okay?
	It’s gonna be okay. We’ll find a way.
	MARY
	Was going to be “Richard”, if it was a
	boy. “Janey” if a girl.
	FREDDIE
	You want kids? We’ll buy some. I think
	you can get ‘em from Harrods--they
	sell everything. If you buy two they
	throw in a nanny.
	MARY
	Your life’s going to be hard,
	my darling.
	FREDDIE
	I know.
	MARY
	I’ll move out.
	FREDDIE
	Stop. No. Don’t take it off. I
	don’t want you to ever take it off.
	MARY
	What do you want from me, Freddie?
	FREDDIE
	Everything?
	Almost.
	FREDDIE
	Just there. Careful. That’s good.
	ROGER
	Is it big enough?
	FREDDIE
	Just! Each cat has its own room--
	it’s perfect. Delilah’s by the
	kitchen, Goliath next door, upstairs
	Romeo, Oscar, Tiffany, Miko...Lily’s
	room is huge, spoilt thing.
	ROGER
	Still not sure the echo is
	quite pronounced enough.
	FREDDIE
	Mary found it for me. Isn’t it
	wonderful?! So I’m poor again. I don’t
	mind. Money is for spending. I’m
	determined to be happy here!
	FREDDIE
	Stay. For dinner.
	ROGER
	I can’t. Kids. Wife. See you.
	FREDDIE
	Not there...
	FREDDIE
	Mary? Turn off your living room
	light, then turn it on again.
	Flash them on and off. Go on.
	I’ll do the same.
	FREDDIE
	Isn’t it perfect we still live
	so close to each other?
	MARY
	I’m never going to get away, am I?
	FREDDIE (V.O.)
	“Each morning I get up I die a little
	Can barely stand on my feet
	Take a look in the mirror and cry
	Lord what you're doing to me
	FREDDIE (V.O.)
	“I have spent all my years in
	believing you
	But I just can't get no relief,
	Lord!...
	Somebody -
	ROGER/BRIAN/FREDDIE
	“SOMEBODY!!”
	FREDDIE
	“Somebody...”
	ROGER/BRIAN/FREDDIE
	“SOMEBODY!!..“CAN ANYBODY FIND ME...”
	FREDDIE
	“...Somebody to Love?”
	CHECKOUT GIRL
	Paying for everyone?
	FREDDIE
	Everyone in the store darling!
	Attention! For the next five minutes
	everything in the store is on me!
	FREDDIE (V.O.)
	“I work hard...Every day of my life...
	I work till I ache in my bones!
	At the end of the day I take home my
	hard earned pay, all on my own. I get
	down on my knees...and I...pray...
	Till the tears run down from my eyes
	Lord! Somebody
	ROGER/BRIAN/FREDDIE
	“SOMEBODY!
	FREDDIE
	“Ooh somebody...
	ROGER/BRIAN/FREDDIE
	“PLEASE! ANYBODY FIND ME....!”
	FREDDIE
	Everybody goes...Who is it? Who are
	you seeing?
	JOE BASTIN
	I can live with a rock-star, but not
	one that’s not ready to commit. Your
	work comes first. Right?
	FREDDIE
	Handsome Joe.
	Kind Joe.
	FREDDIE (V.O.)
	“Somebody tooooooooooooooooo....
	...luuuuuuuuuuuuuuve.”
	OLDER BRIAN
	“Grotesquery of the first order.”
	That’s what the Music Press called our
	next album, A Day At The Races!
	Grotesquery! That hurt Freddie...
	He took criticism to heart. Every
	insult, every bad review sent him
	back to where he’d come from--to
	being that little immigrant boy.
	Anyway, are we done? You said this
	would be quick.
	BLOGGER
	Couple more questions, almost there.
	What was the criticism like?
	FREDDIE
	We know you all hate us, but it’s what
	the public thinks that matters to us.
	CRITIC 1
	I don’t hate you Freddie. I just
	wonder why you’re so successful?
	FREDDIE
	And I wonder how big your cunt is--can
	you fit it over your head like a hat?
	FREDDIE
	Sorry, just don’t like bullies.
	CRITIC 3
	Freddie--your private life -
	FREDDIE
	Next question?
	CRITIC 2
	Freddie--why don’t you get your teeth
	fixed?
	FREDDIE
	I live in Britain--I don’t want to
	stand out.
	Besides, I need them--I lie through
	them.
	CRITIC 3
	Is it true there are tensions in the
	band.
	FREDDIE
	No. None. None at all. Never have
	been.
	ROGER
	Let’s just say we are four very
	strong personalities.
	FREDDIE
	We’re four cocks--fighting--roosters
	that is.

	The band don’t like my answers--And
	frankly I don’t much care for theirs.
	CRITIC 4
	“Bismillah”. What does it mean?
	FREDDIE
	Nothing -
	JOHN
	“We Are The Champions”? It sounds
	so conceited.
	FREDDIE
	It’s not about us.
	Sit. Everybody sit. Just because
	we’re on tour doesn’t mean we have
	to live like animals. Sit. I want
	us all to start dining together
	after every show.
	BRIAN
	“We Are The Champions”? The critics
	would -
	FREDDIE
	 - Fuck the critics! It’s a song for
	the crowd -
	- anyone who wants to taste victory,
	who’s never been allowed to.
	ROGER
	Then call it “You Are The Champions”.
	FREDDIE
	Sinatra could sing “I'm A-number-one,
	top of the list, king of the hill.”
	BRIAN
	Then it is about us?
	FREDDIE
	Beluga caviar. Rare beef. Champagne.
	Moet naturally. Eat!
	ROGER
	Like the champions we are.
	FREDDIE
	You haven’t even heard the song yet.
	Everybody shuttup’n eat!
	BRIAN
	So how’s it go?
	FREDDIE
	Like all our best work it’s just a
	little disposable thing, like a
	plastic razor...like a used tampon.
	BRIAN
	When we do the Rolling Stone
	interview, maybe find another
	metaphor.
	FREDDIE
	“I’ve paid my dues,
	Time after time.
	I've done my sentence
	But committed no crime.
	And bad mistakes?
	I've made a few.
	I've had my share of sand kicked in my
	face but I've come through.
	ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN
	“And I need just go on and on, and on,
	and on.
	FREDDIE/ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN
	“We are the champions, my friends,
	And we'll keep on fighting 'til the
	end. We are the champions.
	We are the champions. No time for
	losers 'cause we are the champions of
	the world.
	Sing it! Let’s hear you!
	CROWD
	“WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, MY FRIENDS,
	AND WE'LL KEEP ON FIGHTING 'TIL THE
	END. WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS...
	WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS...
	NO TIME FOR LOSERS 'CAUSE WE ARE THE
	CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD!”
	FREDDIE
	Told you so! It’s their song!
	“I've taken my bows
	And my curtain calls
	You brought me fame and fortune and
	everything that goes with it
	I thank you all!
	FREDDIE
	“But it's been no bed of roses,
	No pleasure cruise.
	I consider it a challenge before the
	whole human race
	And I ain't gonna lose!!!!
	BRIAN
	That was amazing. They kept singing,
	even after we’d left the stage.
	FREDDIE
	They want to join the band, darling!
	Every fan sub-consciously wants to
	join the band.
	BRIAN
	Then let’s let ‘em join the band. They
	can sing, they can clap, they can
	stamp their feet. Let’s write
	something that gets ‘em even more
	involved.
	FREDDIE
	The critics will hate it. Right
	then--first one to write a cracking
	audience participation song gets -
	- a piece of my Mr Kiplings Almond
	Slice. I’m now having them flown in
	from London to go with my cup of tea.
	ROGER
	Hey. Great song man.
	FREDDIE
	Why thankyou Roger.
	JOHN
	It’s a hit.
	FREDDIE
	Of course it’s a hit. But--muchos
	gracias amigos.
	MARY
	Freddie?
	MARY
	David.
	FREDDIE
	David! David. Hello dear. Be very
	good to Mary, won’t you. Sorry about
	this but we’re all about to change--
	clothes.
	See you later.
	FREDDIE
	Right. Lovely to meet you John.
	DAVID
	David.
	FREDDIE
	David! David.
	FREDDIE
	Gentlemen? I have an announcement.
	Let’s get this out of the way.
	I’ll say this once and then I don’t
	want to discuss it again.
	I’m bisexual.
	ROGER
	You’re also very mean with your
	Almond Slices.
	ENGINEER (MIKE STONE)
	Everyone! As many people as you can
	get! Up on the drum risers! Tea
	Ladies! Cleaners! Everyone!
	ENGINEER
	Okay. On Four. One, two, three,
	four...
	FREDDIE
	“Buddy you're a boy make a big noise,
	Playin' in the street gonna be a big
	man some day -
	BRIAN
	Freddie, Freddie, Jesus man! This
	isn’t Opera now--we want the audience
	to sing along to this one and you’re
	the only guy in the world who can
	sing that high.
	FREDDIE
	Drop it down? Y’think?
	FREDDIE
	“Buddy you're a boy make a big noise,
	Playin' in the street gonna be a big
	man some day -
	PAUL PRENTER
	They all come here, all our famous
	ones: Rock Hudson, Robert
	Mapplethorpe, Rudolph Nureyev comes
	here, Fassbinder, Foucoult. It's
	absolutely without question the place
	in the universe for someone like you.
	Anything goes.
	FREDDIE
	You know, despite my stage persona,
	I’m still really a very shy boy.
	PAUL PRENTER
	Oh this place’ll cure you of all that.
	Life-changing. Trust me. And!--and I
	can even get you your own key to the
	private VIP room downstairs. Almost
	no-one gets their own key!
	FREDDIE
	...Bis--millah!
	FREDDIE
	My own key!
	MEAT-PACKER 1
	Hey!
	MEAT-PACKER 2
	What the fuck do we have here?
	PAUL PRENTER
	No problem. Freddie? Come on.
	FREDDIE
	I love it. It’s like West Side story.
	MEAT-PACKER 3
	You guys sure picked the wrong street
	to walk down.
	FREDDIE
	Oh, I don’t know about that. Lovely
	bunch of beefy boys like you...
	PAUL PRENTER
	Come on!
	FREDDIE
	We’re having a party. Come have a
	drink, brother.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Should I have gone into his room?
	Accepted him and his new world?
	We were worried--about the road he was
	going down--we’d promised to look out
	for him--but at the time we didn’t
	think there was anything we could do.
	(beat)
	Still, for all our problems, the hits
	kept coming. John Deacon wrote us the
	biggest hit we ever had in the United
	States...
	OLDER BRIAN
	Let’s just say the world in 1981 was
	so square that no-one who watched
	this video even guessed Freddie was
	the least bit gay!
	MARY
	What’s the emergency?!
	FREDDIE
	I need someone to go in there (gay
	club) with me. I can’t go in alone.
	MARY
	Freddie?! I left David in the middle
	of dinner!
	FREDDIE
	He’s very short, isn’t he. Five foot
	six, seven?
	MARY
	How dare you! HOW DARE YOU! You know
	what? Find someone else. Call your PA!
	I’m sure PAUL is lurking close by.
	FREDDIE
	Mary! You’re here now. Just give me
	five minutes. Please! Please.
	I’ll pay you.
	This infuriates her further.
	MARY
	What’s happening to you?
	FREDDIE
	I can’t stand being alone right now.
	How do I look? My hair is so horrible
	and still fucking greasy!
	FREDDIE
	Ten minutes. Then you can go home to
	David in my Rolls Royce. I’m very
	happy for you. Really.
	MARY
	Five. Five minutes.
	MARY
	Well, this feels natural.
	FREDDIE
	Must seen very strange to you, sorry
	darling.
	MARY
	You do this a lot?
	FREDDIE
	Bars. Sometimes in the park, you know.
	MARY
	Have you heard from Joe?
	FREDDIE
	Love is Russian Roulette for me, with
	all the chambers loaded. So here I am.
	Sad, isn’t it, to only trust
	strangers.
	(beat)
	And you.
	(holds her hand)
	Do you love him?
	MARY
	He wants to have children.
	(looking around)
	And so you always just wait for
	someone to approach you?
	FREDDIE
	Absolutely. I’m not a tramp, darling!
	Can’t have them getting the wrong
	idea!
	FREDDIE
	I love you.
	MARY
	That’s the problem.
	JIM HUTTON
	You don’t remember me? Probably the
	leather. You come to my salon. Never
	forget a hair-cut.
	MARY
	Oh hello.
	JIM HUTTON
	Jim.
	MARY
	Mary. And this is -
	- this is--umm--ummm--
	JIM HUTTON
	You can’t remember?
	MARY
	He goes by many names.
	JIM HUTTON
	A man of mystery then?
	FREDDIE
	How big’s your cock?
	MARY- shocked - turns to FREDDIE -
	MARY
	And that’s not giving them “the
	wrong idea”?!
	JIM HUTTON
	I was just going to offer you a
	drink and some conversation, I
	don’t give a fuck who you are—-you
	shouldn’t be rude.
	MARY
	I like him.
	FREDDIE
	I like him too.
	MARY
	Great. Then I’ll leave you two to
	get to know each other. I have a
	spaghetti bolognese getting cold.
	MARY
	Bye Jim.
	JIM HUTTON
	So--Freddie--you wanna start again?
	OLDER BRIAN
	And then--at the height of our
	popularity--we screwed up. We recorded
	a video, dreamt up by Roger, for a new
	song that John wrote, but which
	everyone thought was Freddie’s idea...
	PAUL PRENTER
	How are you?
	FREDDIE
	I’m working too hard. Sometimes I feel
	I could just give it all up. Honestly.
	Tour, album, video, tour, album
	video...
	PAUL PRENTER
	What you need to do? What you need to
	do--is go solo.
	FREDDIE
	Not you now.
	PAUL PRENTER
	I’m serious. It’s so clear. You're the
	star. You’re the leader of Queen.
	FREDDIE
	Not “leader”, no. The most important
	person perhaps.
	PAUL PRENTER
	Don’t want control over your life?
	Your schedule?
	PAUL PRENTER
	When Jackson recorded “Thriller”? On
	his own? Not having to share it with
	his brothers? So much fucken money he
	didn’t have to tour. Didn’t have to
	tour. He toured when he wanted to
	tour. Only possible because it was a
	solo album. Freedom.
	FREDDIE
	Well...
	PAUL PRENTER
	I can find a band for you anywhere.
	CBS records has been calling Miami
	every day begging you to do a solo
	deal. Plus, alone you’d be bigger and
	better than ever, and you wouldn’t
	have to deal with so many egos.
	(whispering)
	Freedom. To be Freddie Mercury.
	FREDDIE
	Oh shut up.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	The video was banned. In the USA. And
	it was Freddie who got the blame.
	Never again would we tour there, or
	enjoy the same kind of success.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	We killed the golden goose--and
	Freddie took it hardest...and reacted
	the most destructively...
	When a smiling SECRETARY opens the OFFICE door for them,
	they sweep in to meet...
	YETNIKOFF
	Gentleman. Siddown. Siddown.
	FREDDIE
	Perhaps we should kneel?
	YETNIKOFF
	Ha! Well, he’s a reliable artist.
	Gives his audience what they want,
	time after time.
	YETNIKOFF
	That’s how you build a giant brand.
	YETNIKOFF
	So--
	I’m good you’re good, give it to me
	straight.
	JIM BEACH
	A two-album deal, here at CBS.
	YETNIKOFF
	And you are?
	JIM BEACH
	Queen’s lawyer.
	PAUL PRENTER
	Jim Beach. Freddie gets creative
	control. He’s the biggest act in the
	world and you know it.
	YETNIKOFF
	Michael Jackson is the biggest
	act in the world.
	PAUL PRENTER
	How would you like another Michael
	Jackson?
	YETNIKOFF
	Don’t try to shake me down.
	I served in the US army and I’ve faced
	down Russian tanks across Check-Point
	Charlie--they blinked first.
	FREDDIE
	I like my sausage warm.
	YETNIKOFF
	And that means...precisely?
	FREDDIE
	What it says. Single-entendre, dear.
	YETNIKOFF
	So--what kinda albums?
	FREDDIE
	Disco.
	YETNIKOFF
	Disco? Mmkay.
	FREDDIE
	And opera. The second album.
	YETNIKOFF
	Like Bo Rhapsody? Opera. Like -
	FREDDIE
	No. No. Like...
	FREDDIE
	...pure opera. A collaboration. With
	that voice. Isn’t she remarkable?
	Montserat Cabballe, the finest
	soprano in the world. And I.
	YETNIKOFF
	Is he kidding?
	YETNIKOFF
	Opera? I’d rather have an album that’s
	just the sound of two dogs fucking.
	FREDDIE
	Well, if you want to make it a three
	album deal...
	YETNIKOFF
	Two disco albums. And fast--disco’s a
	bubble. Gonna pop any day, you kiddin’
	me? And no opera. Understood?
	FREDDIE
	“I was born to love you with every
	single beat of my heart
	Yes I was born to take care of you
	Every single day of my life...”
	PAUL PRENTER
	Freddie! It’s -
	ROGER
	When were you going to tell us?!
	When the album comes out?!
	BRIAN
	Jim Beach said something. We thought
	he was joking. Is he joking? He said:
	“You better talk to Freddie.”
	ROGER
	A solo album?
	FREDDIE
	Actually, two. It’s no big deal.
	JOHN
	Two?! So what, that’s it?!
	ROGER
	How much? What did they pay you?
	What did they pay you?
	FREDDIE
	Four million dollars.
	Not bad--you have to admit. But I’m
	worth it. I’ll be bigger
	than Jackson apparently.
	JOHN
	That’s more than any Queen deal.
	FREDDIE
	We need a break anyway. Album, tour,
	ab aeterno--it’s killing us.
	ROGER
	No, no, you’re killing us.
	FREDDIE
	Let’s take some tea in the garden.
	But first I want to play you
	something new. Listen to this -
	ROGER
	Jesus Christ, Fred! You have to snap
	out of this! We’re talking about -
	FREDDIE
	We can’t stand each other right now,
	admit it! And we’re not touring thanks
	to this fiasco in the US...
	BRIAN
	One video was banned. We could tour.
	FREDDIE
	MTV banned our video!!! The youth of
	America! We helped give birth to MTV!
	I’m never touring in the US again!
	And! And I’m being blamed for it,
	dear, not you, whose idea I believe it
	was to dress up in drag!
	And not you!
	Not even you, who wrote the goddamn
	song! No. “Crazy cross-dressing
	Freddie”! “Freddie The Fag” - coast to
	coast. “Freddie the Freak”!
	ROGER
	You loved the idea.
	PAUL PRENTER
	It’s what Freddie wants. He has to
	move on now.
	FREDDIE
	Come on, you must all want a break,
	from the arguments--what songs get on
	the album, whose song should be the
	single, what’s on the B-side, who
	wrote what, who gets to earn the most
	money -
	BRIAN
	We’re a family.
	FREDDIE
	No we’re not, dear. It’s alright for
	you--Roger--John--you’ve all got kids,
	real family. What have I got down the
	road? I’m this or nothing!
	ROGER
	You were running a stall in Kensington
	Market before we gave you a chance!
	FREDDIE
	And without me you’d be a dentist
	playing blues on the weekend at the
	Crown and Anchor!
	And you’d be Dr Brian May, with a nice
	little PHD, winner of the faculty
	prize for the best hair on campus!
	ROGER
	You owe us loyalty! Allegiance! Even
	though you clearly don’t feel any!
	BRIAN
	You really think we’re nothing without
	you?
	FREDDIE
	You’re something--I made you great!
	ROGER
	Believe this guy?
	BRIAN
	Come on, you’re better than this. You
	really are.
	JOHN
	If your album’s a flop, our entire
	backlist gets dragged down with you,
	devalued. Your fate is our fate,
	whether you like it or not.
	FREDDIE
	Spoken like an accountant--sorry John,
	but Christ Wept!
	You don’t understand me anymore.
	It’s a shame.
	Paul? Pick this up.
	FREDDIE
	Oh don’t look so glum. No-one died.
	It’s only rock and roll, for heavens
	sake.
	ROGER
	Queen is dead.
	FREDDIE
	Give her a kiss one day, she might
	wake up...
	FREDDIE
	...Who knows?
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	He ran away. Moved to Munich. We lost
	him.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	But now he had to deliver on two solo
	albums, two disco albums, that would
	repay the enormous advance the record
	company had paid, and he’d never
	recorded on his own before.
	PRENTER
	He can’t talk now. He’s working. He
	works day and night.
	FREDDIE
	Listen to that! That’s the sound I
	want! The sound of--youth, the sound
	of youth! It’s that! Pleasure!
	Indulgence! Hedonism! Ecstacy!
	Ecstacy!
	FREDDIE
	Well, let’s just fucking try it again,
	yes? Because right now it’s so bad I
	can’t even recognise it as being the
	worst song I’ve ever written! Is any
	of this getting lost in translation?
	Mac? Do we need to hire a translator?
	MAC
	Freddie. We should go again.
	FREDDIE
	Ja! We should go again! Danke! Then
	let’s--jolly well--go again.
	MAC
	Time to go home Freddie. Let’s do
	this tomorrow.
	FREDDIE
	No, no--completely take out the
	drums for the first twelve bars -
	MAC
	Take them out?
	FREDDIE
	Take them out, gone--just the vocal
	for the first two lines, try that.
	Something has to work.
	FREDDIE
	“Sometime I feel I’m gonna break
	down and cry, Nowhere to go nothing
	to do with my time, I get lonely,
	so lonely, Living on my own...”
	He starts to COUGH. He grabs a napkin. He coughs up BLOOD.
	MAC
	Freddie?
	PAUL PRENTER
	Oh. Hello. Freddie, no -
	PAUL PRENTER
	Would you like to leave a message?
	PAUL PRENTER
	May I introduce you to our record
	executives. Everyone, this is Holly.
	She’s a big fan of Freddie Mercury.
	The GROUPIE goes up to the first one and gets on her knees.
	GROUPIE
	I only missed one--he left early.
	FREDDIE
	Don’t worry--I got him before he left.
	JIM BEACH
	Is he there? Where is he? I need to
	talk to him. It’s one performance.
	For a good cause...
	PAUL PRENTER
	No. He’s not here. I’ll pass the
	message on. Call you, absolutely.
	OLDER BRIAN
	His solo album? Flopped. You only have
	to listen to it. The darkness,
	creeping in. He was hurting. Cut off
	from everyone he could trust. Lost.
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	We failed him. We promised to be
	there for him.
	OLDER BRIAN
	And where were we, his family who
	should have gone to his rescue?
	We were too English to tell him we
	were worried about the road he was
	going down, or that we felt sad, that
	we were hurting. So Freddie just hid
	from us, assuming we disapproved. We
	didn’t, but we didn’t tell him.
	There was a key--key--that some of
	these people gave him, to a room in
	some -
	- club, some deplorable basement...
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	I heard later that every person
	granted the ‘privilege’ of getting
	their very own key to that door...
	OLDER BRIAN
	...is dead. They all died.
	Want to know a secret?
	The BLOGGER nods -
	OLDER BRIAN
	When Freddie left us, he wasn’t the
	only one to get in trouble. Roger,
	John, yes me-- we were all given keys
	of some sort--we all ruined our
	relationships in basements chasing
	barmaids, strippers, “angels with
	broken wings.”
	OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)
	Even told ourselves we were still
	working!--that living dangerously -
	dancing on the edge of the abyss -
	that looking for heaven and wonder and
	romance in strange beds was our job,
	our mission as rock stars, going to
	the ends of the earth to places people
	only dream of, just to find out what
	it’s like so we can come back and put
	it in a song...
	OLDER BRIAN
	Ha!...but there were no songs. Excess
	just broke our hearts, nearly
	destroyed us, and in the end--for
	Freddie?...
	FREDDIE
	“The boy had a way with words, he
	sang, he moved with grace
	He entertained so naturally, no
	gesture out of place
	His road in life was clearly drawn, he
	didn't hesitate
	Keep going! -
	MONSERAT
	“I love you for your passion, I love
	you for your fire
	The violent desire that burns me in
	its flame
	A love I dare not name...
	PRENTER
	Queen--
	FREDDIE
	Mmmm?
	PRENTER
	--have been invited to perform, called
	“Live Aid”, part of a line-up of other
	bands. Charity thing, linked to that
	Christmas single, “Do They Know It’s
	Christmas”, on which you were not
	invited to sing! Now they want to do a
	concert for Africa--they’re desperate,
	need as many bands as they can get.
	FREDDIE
	How flattering. What--
	(clearly interested)
	--do the others say?
	PRENTER
	I’m presuming they’ll do anything.
	They didn’t want you, now they’re
	desperate.
	FREDDIE
	Then tell them--tell them to use all
	the singers they invited to do the
	fucking single!
	MARY
	Hello Freddie.
	FREDDIE
	What the hell? What are you - ?! Come
	in! Come in! My God! This is...!
	MARY
	I haven’t heard from you. I phoned and
	phoned. I was worried about you. And
	last night I had a terrible dream,
	that something bad had happened -
	FREDDIE
	No! Nothing bad has happened.
	Quite the contrary.
	MARY
	You look pale. And sad.
	FREDDIE
	I’ve been up all night--working,
	that’s all. Wait till you hear what
	I’m doing now! It’s remarkable!
	MARY
	You look -
	FREDDIE
	I’m eating better.
	MARY
	- unwell.
	FREDDIE
	Do I? I wish everybody would stop
	saying that. It’s so depressing.
	I’m living like a monk, actually -
	FREDDIE
	- apart from the odd slip.
	MARY
	Some monastery!
	FREDDIE
	Being human is a condition that
	requires a little anesthesia.
	MARY
	Come back to London. I miss you.
	FREDDIE
	Miss you too.
	FREDDIE
	So much. But I have to finish this
	second album. I’ll be done soon.
	Promise. Let me show you!
	FREDDIE
	Well? WELL?
	FREDDIE
	Do you like it?
	MARY
	I do.
	FREDDIE
	It’s good, isn’t it?! It’s really
	good!
	MARY
	But I thought CBS has forbidden an
	opera record.
	FREDDIE
	Sshhh. They have. But I’ll pay for
	it myself.
	It’s so great to have you here.
	Mary--I need you. Stay. Stay here,
	with me, just till I finish the
	album! Two months! Just you and I!
	Your own bedroom.
	FREDDIE
	Say “Yes.” You can help me work, you
	can be my inspiration.
	I need the love of my life.
	She melts -
	MARY
	Oh Freddie...
	MARY
	I don’t want to sit here and watch
	you hurt yourself. All the parties,
	drugs, strange people -
	FREDDIE
	No. No, no, no. I’ll work. I’ll
	just work, that’s all. Live a quiet
	life, we’ll look after each other
	and become vegan missionaries until
	the album is done.
	MARY
	Work? And nothing else? Mr Mercury?
	FREDDIE
	I promise. Oh, and people call me
	“Your Royal Highness” now.
	MARY
	I’m sure they do.
	FREDDIE
	I’ll show you! I’m gonna start now,
	prove it to you! Just watch! Work!
	FREDDIE
	Total dedication!
	“Just you wait ‘enry ‘iggins just
	you wait.”
	FREDDIE
	I’m working on another piece to
	suit Monserat’s voice. Can you
	imagine? Writing for the most
	divine voice on earth?
	MARY
	That’s good Freddie. That’s good.
	FREDDIE
	A piano introduction, in E/m...
	(we hear this)
	and then...change, B7B9...
	(and this)
	...and then, her voice...Octave
	higher! E/m...
	FREDDIE
	PAUL PRENTER
	Sorry we’re late!
	Oh! Mary! What a pleasant surprise!
	PAUL PRENTER
	What brings you here? Should have
	told us you were coming--What
	hotel are you staying at?
	FREDDIE
	Mary? Come on.
	MARY
	Bye Freddie.
	FREDDIE
	Mary...
	Paul! Everyone, you have to leave.
	REVELLERS
	LEAVE?!
	FREDDIE
	Everyone out. OUT! Out, out!
	PAUL PRENTER
	Well you heard him. Everyone out!
	Out! Out!
	PAUL PRENTER
	There. That’s better.
	MARY
	Him too.
	FREDDIE
	Mary -
	MARY
	Him too. I’m not staying if he’s here.
	FREDDIE
	Paul. You need to go.
	PAUL PRENTER
	For how long?
	FREDDIE
	(to MARY)
	How long?
	MARY
	We don’t need him anymore.
	PAUL PRENTER
	What’s going on? Fred?
	MARY
	We don’t need you. In fact, ever
	since you showed up you’ve been
	looking after yourself. You don’t
	care about him.
	He’s using you. He’s been cutting
	you off from all the people who
	truly care about you. It’s sick!
	PAUL PRENTER
	I take orders from Freddie.
	(to FREDDIE)
	You want this? Seriously?
	(to MARY)
	He’s going to be the biggest act
	in the world. And I’m gonna help
	him get there. So maybe it’s you
	who should go.
	FREDDIE
	Please. It’s going to be fine.
	FREDDIE
	Fuck.
	PAUL PRENTER
	Freddie, listen to me, she’s trying
	to pull everything down we’ve built up-
	-She’s jealous.
	FREDDIE
	Mary--stop this--you’re not going
	anywhere.
	MARY
	Goodbye Freddie.
	PAUL PRENTER
	I don’t know what she was thinking,
	coming here. What a scene!
	FREDDIE goes to the window to see -
	FREDDIE
	You’re out, Paul. It’s over. Things
	have to change.
	PAUL PRENTER
	You’re firing me?
	FREDDIE
	I’m firing you! Yes! Be gone before I
	come back!
	PAUL PRENTER
	With everything I know? With all the
	photographs I have of Mr Freddie
	Mercury?
	FREDDIE
	Careful! Be very careful! I used to
	box in school--still have the trophy!
	Do not! Mess! With me!
	PAUL PRENTER
	You’re blaming me for everything?
	FREDDIE
	No, I blame myself! I made a monster,
	used every trick in the book on myself
	and I fell for it all - lights!
	camera! action! - because, truth is, I
	don’t much like myself--so I made a
	monster--but one so damn big I don’t
	have the strength to play him most of
	the time! Blame myself for something
	else too, for being weak--too weak to
	realise the first thing you attract,
	when you go rotten, is fruit-flies,
	attracted by the decay, dirty little
	fruit flies...
	FREDDIE
	...coming to feast on what’s left.
	Well, there isn’t much left anymore,
	Paul, so do what you like with your
	little photos and anecdotes - “Freddie
	did this - “, “Freddie did that - “--
	Get a good price, and then make sure I
	never see your supercilious little
	fucking face again or I will knock you
	down and you will stay down!
	PAUL PRENTER
	(on TV)
	“his lovers, they were
	countless”...”drug-fuelled parties
	that went on for days”...”but to me he
	remained a frightened little boy from
	Zanzibar”...”the relationship with
	Mary, that was just a cover”...”they
	paid him $4 million for his first solo
	album, which of course failed”...
	JIM BEACH
	Hello? Freddie?
	FREDDIE
	I need to sue. To sue Prenter. Need
	you to set that up. OK?
	JIM BEACH
	Where are you? I’ve been calling you
	in Munich. Tell me where you are?
	FREDDIE
	There was this Africa concert, that
	wants Queen to play. What, um...Is
	that still...?
	JIM BEACH
	Too late. They’ve announced the acts
	already. Tickets sold. Fred?
	Are you in Munich?
	FREDDIE
	Miami--I need to connect again with
	the Mothership. (smiles sadly)
	Do you think you could organise a
	meeting? Would they--would they come,
	do you think?
	JIM BEACH
	They’re still very upset. They don’t
	really want anything to do with you
	I’m afraid.
	FREDDIE
	Oh. If you ask them, they’ll meet me.
	Tell them I want to talk, just talk.
	We’re family, you know? Family have
	fights...all the time...
	JIM BEACH
	I don’t know Freddie.
	FREDDIE
	Are the others here?
	FREDDIE
	You said they were here.
	JIM BEACH
	They’re here--somewhere. Wait here.
	JIM BEACH exits.
	JIM BEACH
	He’s here.
	BRIAN
	Let him wait.
	No-one moves.
	FREDDIE
	Where are they?
	JIM BEACH
	They’re coming.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Hadn’t we waited for him? We
	were angry.
	JIM BEACH
	Who wants to go first?
	JOHN
	Well, I have an announcement. I’m
	leaving the band -
	JOHN
	- to become a record executive at
	emi.
	JIM BEACH
	Thankyou John for the levity. Well,
	I’ll start -
	FREDDIE
	No. I’ll start. I’ll start. I’ve been
	hideous. I know I have. And I deserve
	your wrath. I know that. I’ve been a
	conceited selfish...well, an asshole,
	basically.
	ROGER
	Strong beginning.
	FREDDIE
	Now I’m happy to strip off my shirt
	and flagellate myself before you or,
	or I could ask a simple question.
	JOHN
	I’m good with the flagellation.
	FREDDIE
	What will it take for you all to
	forgive me?
	BRIAN
	Is that what you want, Freddie? I
	forgive you. Is that it, can we go
	now?
	JIM BEACH
	What Freddie wants is -
	ROGER
	- Why don’t we let Freddie tell us
	what he wants.
	FREDDIE
	Queen. I want Queen. I tried to give
	Michael Jackson a run for his money
	but turns out he’s faster than he
	looks. I hired a great band, fine
	musicians that would do exactly what I
	told them, and the big problem was
	they did exactly what I told them.
	Without the sparks, no fire--No fire?
	No magic. No surprises. Without Roger
	contradicting me, I found I couldn’t
	concentrate. Without Brian telling me
	to do it his way, I couldn’t work out
	what I wanted. Without John giving me
	“that look” I could never reach a
	decision. I need the Mothership. I
	always did. I need my family back. And
	right now, my dears, I need you more
	than you can possibly imagine. So.
	Name your terms.
	ROGER
	Could you step out of the room for a
	second, Fred?
	BRIAN
	What?
	ROGER
	Just fucking with him.
	JIM BEACH
	Shall...I get him back in?
	ROGER
	We decided...what did we decide?
	JOHN
	We decided things need to change.
	From now on, everything gets shared
	evenly. Doesn’t matter who writes the
	song, it’s a Queen song. Four ways
	evenly.
	FREDDIE
	Done.
	ROGER
	And we have a problem with the team
	of people you have around you.
	FREDDIE
	Paul is out. I fired him.
	JOHN
	On what pretext?
	FREDDIE
	Villainy.
	Light me a cigarette would you Miami?
	FREDDIE
	What else?
	BRIAN
	Bob Geldoff. He keeps phoning.
	FREDDIE
	How did I offend him?
	ROGER
	Wants to squeeze us into the line-up
	for “Live Aid”.
	JOHN
	As an after-thought!
	ROGER
	He wants an answer now. He swears
	a lot.
	JOHN
	Every ticket is already sold. So if
	we do it, not one in the audience
	will’ve paid to see us.
	ROGER
	And any fans will’ve forgotten who
	we are anyway.
	JOHN
	Plus--we haven’t played together
	for 3 years. Kinda suicide to play
	again for the first time in front of
	thousands...
	ROGER
	...Millions.
	BRIAN
	Yes or no?
	FREDDIE
	It’s a chance to remind them who
	we are.
	ROGER
	And who are we?
	FREDDIE
	We--we are the most preposterous
	rock band in the history of the world
	--and don’t you fucking forget it!
	ROGER
	Okay, let’s try again.
	(taps his drumsticks)
	...two...three...
	The BAND begin to PLAY “HAMMER TO FALL” - but they are too
	RUSTY, and only play a few BARS before they have to stop.
	FREDDIE
	Truly dreadful. Go again.
	BRIAN
	It’s been a while.
	FREDDIE
	We have, what? A twenty minute set?
	Miami, dear? They’ve given us a
	twenty minute set?
	JIM BEACH
	Everyone gets twenty. Jagger, Bowie,
	Elton, McCartney. Twenty minutes to
	rock the world. Just had some numbers,
	guys. Listen up. 72,000 people here in
	London, 100,000 to gather in
	Philadelphia, watching on giant screen
	via live telecast, and a global TV
	audience of 2 billion across 150
	countries. No pressure.
	ROGER
	Okay.
	Two...three...
	JIM BEACH
	Message for you.
	FREDDIE
	Miami--could you get me a car?
	JIM BEACH
	Now?
	FREDDIE
	Wait for me here.
	FREDDIE
	Ohhh Joe.
	FREDDIE
	Handsome Joe.
	Kind Joe.
	YOUNG HIV MAN
	Hey.
	NURSE 2
	Doctor will see you now.
	YOUNG HIV MAN
	Day-O.
	FREDDIE
	Day-O
	GELDOFF
	No! Fok off! It’s a focken famine!
	People are focken’ dying! Africa needs
	this money NOW! (Hangs up) Fuck!
	WORKER
	Coffee?
	GELDOFF
	No thank-you.
	MARY
	Here. Try and drink this? Lemon
	and honey. How is it? (the throat)
	FREDDIE
	Not good. And my knee is killing me
	too. I’m not sure I can do it,
	Mary-kins. I’m serious.
	He touches her PREGNANT belly -
	FREDDIE
	How is my god-son? Little Richard?
	FREDDIE
	What time’s the car coming?
	MARY
	3.30.
	MARY
	The show starts in a few minutes.
	FREDDIE
	I’m going for a walk.
	FRANCIS ROSSI
	More volume.

	“Empty spaces - what are we living for
	Abandoned places - I guess we know the

	Not allowed to go higher than “7” -
	regulations, sorry.
	FREDDIE
	Where are you sticking that?!
	DOCTOR
	Back of your throat. Small steroid
	injection.
	FREDDIE
	Get that away from me! Christ!
	I need vodka and three cigarettes
	right-fucking-now!
	FREDDIE
	Ahhh---hah!--hah!
	How long do we have?
	BRIAN
	As long as you need then halve it.
	FREDDIE
	Ahhh---hah!--hah! DAAYY-O--AAYYY-O...
	Guys?! I have to cut the DAY-O’s with
	the crowd. My voice can’t handle it.
	BRIAN
	Good idea. Look after your voice.
	FREDDIE
	Cigarettes! Ahhh---hah!--hah!
	FREDDIE
	So greasy! Why is it always so greasy?
	JIM HUTTON
	Because you wash it six times a day.
	FREDDIE
	That makes no sense.
	FREDDIE
	Miami? I thank you.
	I’m turning over a new leaf.
	From now on I’m going monastic.
	FREDDIE
	Early nights, mineral water -
	Nastrovia.
	FREDDIE downs the VODKA, stands up, gargles it for a few
	seconds...
	FREDDIE
	Come on voice come on voice come
	on voice--you can do it--one more
	charge--one last hurrarr...
	FREDDIE
	Ahh.ha..ha..ha, meee,mee...

	YETNIKOFF
	And for me he writes a fucken opera!
	FREDDIE
	“I've paid my dues/Time after time.
	I've done my sentence/ But committed
	no crime.
	FREDDIE
	“And bad mistakes? I've made a few.
	I've had my -
	FREDDIE
	“- share of sand kicked in my face
	But I've come through!
	We are the champions, my friends,
	And we'll keep on fighting 'til
	the end.
	We are the champions.
	We are the champions.
	No time for losers
	'Cause we are the champions of
	the world.
	FREDDIE
	“I've taken my bows/ And my curtain
	calls/ You brought me fame and fortune
	and everything that goes with it
	I thank you all!
	FREDDIE
	“But it's been no bed of roses,
	No pleasure cruise/ I consider it a
	challenge before the whole human race/
	And I ain't gonna lose!
	FREDDIE AND CROWD
	“We are the champions, my friends,
	And we'll keep on fighting 'til the
	end.
	We are the champions.
	We are the champions.
	No time for losers
	'Cause we are the champions of the
	worrrrrrrrlllllldddddd!!!!”
	OLDER BRIAN
	Write what you want. You people
	always do. I need to sleep.
	Just don’t call him “wicked” or
	“corrupt”! -
	- he lived life! To the brim! -
	and perhaps -
	- yeah, over the brim -
	- but he was always singing for the
	person right at the back of the
	stadium, the one who doesn’t fit in,
	the outcasts, the shy, and the prettydamn-sure-they-don’t-matter. He showed
	them they too could fly, fly above the
	haters and the detractors and the
	pullers-down--coz that’s what rock and
	roll can do. It can re-define you.
	Dream heroic--and little Farrokh
	Bulsara did that.
	BLOGGER
	“Re-define you.” In what way?
	OLDER BRIAN
	If you’ve never put on your favourite
	song and never felt it--then you’ll
	never know.
	(beat)
	Freddie made you feel--better--bigger--
	braver...
	(smiles, gently)
	...happier. Now that’s it, we’re done!
	We’re done.
	BLOGGER
	But we didn’t get to the end! The
	end of the story.
	OLDER BRIAN
	You know what happened. Everyone
	knows what happened.
	BLOGGER
	Must have been very hard.
	OLDER BRIAN
	You ran out of battery. Do you
	need a taxi? Let me call a cab.
	BLOGGER
	Were you there at the end?
	My last question. Promise.
	OLDER BRIAN
	Look at that! It’s morning!
	BLOGGER
	Dr May?
	OLDER BRIAN
	Mmmm?
	BLOGGER
	One last question.
	OLDER BRIAN
	You used your last question several
	hours ago.
	BLOGGER
	Bismillah. Bismillah.
	Will you ever tell anyone what
	Freddie meant by that word?
	OLDER BRIAN
	Here. A gift. Now get out of here!
	Out!
	FREDDIE (V.O.)
	“Sometimes I get to feelin'
	I was back in the old days--long ago
	When we were kids, when we were young
	Things seemed so perfect - you know?
	The days were endless, we were crazy -
	we were young -
	FREDDIE
	“The sun was always shinin' - we just
	lived for fun. Sometimes it seems like
	lately - I just don't know, the rest
	of my life's been - just a show.
	Those were the days of our lives. The
	bad things in life were so few. Those
	days are all gone now but one thing is
	true - When I look and I find I still
	love you.”
	FREDDIE
	“You can't turn back the clock,
	you can't turn back the tide
	Ain't that a shame?...”
	FREDDIE (V.O.)
	“I'd like to go back one time on a
	roller coaster ride
	When life was just a game
	No use sitting and thinkin' on what
	you did/ When you can lay back and
	enjoy it through your kids
	Sometimes it seems like lately I just
	don't know/ Better sit back and go -
	with the flow...
	FREDDIE (V.O.)
	“Cos these are the days of our lives
	They've flown in the swiftness of time
	These days are all gone now but some
	things remain
	When I look and I find - no change.”
	FREDDIE (V.O.)
	“Those were the days of our lives yeah
	The bad things in life were so few
	Those days are all gone now but one
	thing's still true
	FREDDIE
	I still love you.
