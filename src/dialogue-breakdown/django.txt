          Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
          harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
     
                         THE RIDER
          Good cold evening gentlemen.
          Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
          slave traders that go by the'name of
          The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

                         ACE SPECK
          Who wants to. know?

                         THE RIDER
          I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
          is my horse, Fritz.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You a doctor?
                         DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Affirmative.

                         DICKY SPECK
          What kinda doctor?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
          purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

                         ACE SPECK
          So what?


                         LE
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So, I wish to parley with you.

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
          second language. Amongst your inventory,
          I've been led to believe, is a specimen
          I'm keen to acquire.
          Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
          you, who was formerly a resident of
          The Carrucan Plantation?

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

                         DJANGO
          Django.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
          for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
          amazing name - during your time at the
          Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
          three overseers by the name of The Brittle
          Brothers?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

                         DJANGO
          Dem da Brittle Brothers.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So Django, do you think you could recognize -
          ï¿½. 
                         
                         ACE SPECK
          Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Like what?

                         ACE SPEC
          Like that!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English, goddamit!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
          trying to conduct a transaction.

                         ACE SPECK
          I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
          sale.
                         ACE SPECK
          Move it!
          Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          My good man, did you simply get carried away
          with your dramatic gesture, or are you
          pointing that weapon at me with lethal
          intention...?

                         ACE SPECK
          Last chance, fancy pants
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          - Very well -
          
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
          But I didn't want you to do anything rash
          before you had a moment to come to your senses.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ.
          I only shot your brother, once he threatened
          to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...
          .one, two, three, four, five, six,
          seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

                         DICKY SPECK
          My damn legs busted!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
          caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
          to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          As I was saying, if you were to see
          the Brittle Brothers again, would you
          recognize them?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
          look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
          unshaven white men, can you honestly
          and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?


                         DJANGO
          I can point 'em out.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
          Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          I'm gonna lose this leg!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes, unless you find a talented physician
          very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
          end result. But back to business, how much
          do you want for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          You go to hell!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Don't be silly. How much for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          800 dollars!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
          the slave trade that you and your family does,
          but neither was I born yesterday.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
          that the going rate for African flesh'
          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
          Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
          why would they lie - puts his price at
          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
          young Django here.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          And since your late brother. won't be using
          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
          rubbing, then get up on that horse.
          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
          bill of sale. Do you have one?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
          This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
          Django is spelled with a silent "D",
          is it not?

                         DJANGO
          Huh?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Why not..
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes, that does add a little character.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
          mark here.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
          pleasure doing business with you, but your
          customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Now as to you poor devils.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
          of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
          choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
          beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
          to the nearest town. Which would be at least
          thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
          Or ...
          .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
          rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
          bury the two of them deep, and make your way
          to a more enlightened area of the country.
          The choice is yours.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh, and on the off chance that there's
          any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
          the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Just give him a little kick.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          See, it's not so difficult.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

                         DJANGO
          Who?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Your horse?

                         DJANGO
          What horse?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ'
          The horse you're riding.

                         DJANGO
          This ain't my horse.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes it is.

                         DJANGO
          No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
          it.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
          technically not. If it's my horse, I can
          give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
          Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
          congratulations.

                         DJANGO
          I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
          up in no stable.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ

          Don't worry about all that!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
          intend to name it? Half the fun of having
          a horse is choosing his name. For instance
          my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
          ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
          couldn't do without him.
          Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
          something one does lightly. So once you've
          thought about it for awhile -

                         DJANGO
          - Tony.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          - Tony what?

                         DJANGO
          - I dunno, Tony the horse.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
          Tony?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
          Why Tony?

                         DJANGO
          I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
          tell ya.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
          there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
          an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
          any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
          well. Good job Django, well done.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What's everybody staring at?

                         DJANGO
          They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What's this bizarre obsession they have
          with. you not riding horses?

                         DJANGO
          You askin' me?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So what other archaic rituals are you people
          verboten to take part in?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
          you can do, and what you can't do, and if
          you can't do it, why can't you do it?
          Like for instance, what if we were to walk
          in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
          order a drink, and drink it?
          Would the authorities frown on that?

                         DJANGO
          Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What part would they find the most offensive?

                         DJANGO
          All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
          I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
          at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
          And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
          with no white man, in public.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So if you and I did those things, that would
          be considered enough of a infraction to make
          the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

                         DJANGO
          You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
          The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well in that case Django, after you.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Django you're going to have to learn to trust
          me, and as the man said; "There's no time
          like the,present."
         
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
          weary travelers.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
          for about a hour. But by then we'll be
          servin' breakfast -

                         SALOON KEEPER
          Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
          get that nigger outta here.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
          the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
          jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
          on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
          and that would fall under the domain of the
          Sheriff.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          It looks like we must act as our own bartender.

                         DJANGO
          What kinda dentist are you?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
          Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
          like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
          it's a disaster - But these days I practice
          a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well the way the slave trade deals in
          human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
          deals in corpses.
          The state places a bounty on a man's head.
          I track that man, I find that man, I kill
          that man. After I've killed him, I transport
          that man's corpse back to the authorities -
          and sometimes that's easier said then done.
          I show that corpse to the authorities -
          proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
          - At which point, the authorities pay me
          the bounty.
          Cheers.
                         DJANGO
          What's a bounty?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          It's like a reward.

                         DJANGO
          You kill people and they give you a reward?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Certain people, yes.

                         DJANGO
          White people?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

                         DJANGO
          Bad people?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Badder they are, bigger the reward.
          Which brings me to you, and I must admit
          I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
          to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
          On the other hand, I need your help,
          and if you're not in a position to refuse,
          all the better. So for the time being,
          I'm going to make this slave malarkey
          work to my benefit.
          Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
          So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
          an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
          however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
          disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
          what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

                         DJANGO
          I know what they look like, all right.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
          with me till we find them -

                         DJANGO
          - Where we goin'?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I hear at least two of them are overseeing
          up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
          That means we visit every plantation in
          Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
          find them, you point them out, and I kill
          them. You do that, I agree to give you
          your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
          Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
          dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
          I've already gave him to you -- but once the
          final Brittle brother lies dead in the
          dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
          new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
          included.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
          Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
          start trouble, and scare all these nice
          people? You ain't got nothin' better to
          do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
          and show your ass -

                         PEDESTRIAN
          What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Now you can go get the marshall.


                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Move that buckboard over there long ways
          across the street from the saloon. And I
          want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
          And I want two men with two rifles on this
          roof, and two men with two rifles on that
          roof, with all barrels pointed at that
          front door. And somebody git poor Bill
          outta the goddamn street.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          I think they wonderin' why you playin'
          the piana'.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Good.
          But what are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
          around out front, now they hidin' behind it
          with guns. And a buncha other white folks
          are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
          down here.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
          marshall out there?

                         DJANGO
          If the one I think is the.marshall is the
          marshall, he's out there.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What makes you think he's the marshall?

                         DJANGO
          Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          You in the saloon!

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          We got eleven Winchesters on every way
          outta that buildin'! You got once chance
          git outta this alive! You and your nigger
          come out right now with your hands over
          your head, and I mean, right now!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          First things first! Is this the marshall
          I have the pleasure of addressing?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
          myself of all weapons, and just as you
          have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
          with my hands raised above my head.
          I trust as a representative of the
          criminal justice system of The United
          States of America, I shant be shot down
          in the street, by either you or your deputies,
          before I've had my day in court.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
          'em down like a dog in the street!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
          have your word as a lawman not to shoot
          me down like a dog in the street?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
          somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
          cheat the hangman in my town!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          They're a little tense out there. So don't
          make any quick movements, and let me do
          the talking.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You unarmed?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
          address you, your deputies, and apparently
          the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
          incident that just occurred?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Go on!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
          yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
          court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
          who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
          to elect as their sheriff, who went by
          the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
          wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
          with a price on his head of two hundred
          dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
          or alive.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          The hell you say!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
          news. But I'm willing to wager this man
          was elected sheriff sometime in the last
          two years. I know this because. three years
          ago he was rustling cattle from,
          The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
          Lubbock Texas.
          In my possession. is a warrant made out by
          circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
          of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
          He will back up who I am, and who your
          dear departed sheriff was.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          In other words marshall, you owe me
          two hundred dollars.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
          times. A man who survives, is a man with
          a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
          a good plan. So, having said that, what's
          your plan, young Django?

                         DJANGO
          What'cha mean?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well, after this Brittle business is behind
          us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
          seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
          What's your plan after that?

                         DJANGO
          Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
          Do most slaves take the institution of
          matrimony seriously?

                         DJANGO
          Huh?

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Do slaves believe in marriage'?

                         DJANGO
          Me and my wife do.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Where is she now?

                         DJANGO
          I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
          and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
          She got sold two days 'fore me.
          But I don't know who to.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Care for some jerky?

                         DJANGO
          Sure.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
          purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
          where she is?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
          So how long ago did all this happen?

                         DJANGO
          A few months ago.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Three or four?

                         DJANGO
          Three.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
          and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
          Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
          monthsago?

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          The bad part about slavery being a business,
          is it's immoral. The good part about it being
          a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
          in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
          name in it, and the name of the customer who
          bought her, and more then likely their address.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
          pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
          not going to get you very far in Greenville.
          Not to mention a slave auction town in
          Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
          visit. Free or not.

                         DJANGO
          I'll have my freedom papers.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes you will. But say you show them to some
          rascals, and they take them from you and
          tear them up?

                         DJANGO
          They could do that?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'm not saying they would, but they could.

                         DJANGO
          They do that I'll kill 'em.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
          man. The point being is the place,is just
          too dangerous for you.

                         DJANGO
          Well I gotta go, when do I go?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          When you get more dangerous.

                         DJANGO
          is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that
          wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at
          Versailles.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
          You're playing a character. Your character
          is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
          Remember what I told you. During the act,
          you can never break character.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          It's against the law for niggers to ride
          horses in this territory.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          I said niggers -
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          His name is Django, he's a free man, and
          he can ride what he pleases.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Not on my.property, around my niggers
          he can't.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
          wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
          My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
          valet, Django, and these are our horses,
          Fritz, and Tony.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
          are a gentleman, and a business man.
          And it is in these capacities that we've
          ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
          with you now.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          State your business.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I wish to purchase one of your
          nigger gals.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
          Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
          no appointment, no nuttin'?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'm afraid so.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
          your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
          sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
          say about that?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
          I've been led to believe you to be,
          I have five thousand things I might say,
          that could change your mind.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
          to drink.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Maybe while we discuss business, you
          could provide one of your loveliest black
          creatures to escort Django here around
          your magnificent grounds.

                         SPENCER
          Absolutely. Betina!

                         BETINA
          Yes sir, Big Daddy?

                         SPENCER

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          What's your Jimmies name again?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Django.

                         SPENCER
          Betina sugar, take Django around the
          grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

                         BETINA
          As you please, Big Daddy.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
          free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
          Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
          treated as an extension of myself.

                         SPENCER
          Understood., Schultz. Betina?

                         BETINA
          Yes, sir?

                         SPENCER
          Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
          man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
          him like any of these other niggers around
          here, cause he ain't like any of these
          other niggers around here. Ya got it?


                         BETINA
          Ya want I should treat 'em like white
          folks?

                         SPENCER
          No that's not what I said.

                         BETINA
          Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Yes, I can see that.
          What's the name of that peckawood boy from
          town works with the glass? His mama works
          at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
          the winda's when we have a problem?

          MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
          Oh, you mean Jerry.

                         SPENCER
          Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.
          You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

                         BETINA
          Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Well that's it then... just treat 'em
          like you would Jerry.


                         BETINA
          What'cha do for your massa'?

                         DJANGO
          Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

                         BETINA
          So you really free?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.

                         BETINA
          You mean you wanna dress like that?

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I've been'told by those who should know,
          the most exquisite African flesh in the
          state of Tennessee is bred right here on
          your land. And from the look of these
          black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

                         SPENCER
          Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
          faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
          field. But the lion share of my lady
          niggers are real show pony's.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
          pony for young Django. So the only
          question that remains is, do you have a
          nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

                         SPENCER
          DOCTOR SHULTZ, five thousand dollar nigger,
          is practically my middle name.


                         DJANGO
          Betina, come over here, I need to ask
          you something.

                         BETINA
          What'cho want?

                         DJANGO
          I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
          brothers. Overseers. Their name is
          Brittle. Do you know 'em?

                         BETINA
          Brittle?

                         DJANGO
          Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
          And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

                         BETINA
          I don't know dem.

                         DJANGO
          They could be usin' a different name.
          They woulda' come to the plantation in
          the last year.

                         BETINA
          You mean The Shaffer's?

                         DJANGO
          Maybe? Three brother?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Are they here?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Can you point one of 'em out to me?

                         BETINA
          Well ones over in that field.
          She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
          in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.


                         BETINA
          Is that who you lookin' for?

                         DJANGO
          Yep.

                         DJANGO
          Where's the other two?

          BETINA.
          They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
          for breakin' eggs.

                         DJANGO
          They whippin' Little Jody?

                         DJANGO
          Point me in that direction.

                         BETINA
          You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.

                         DJANGO
          Go git that white man, I came here with.

                         DJANGO
          Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
          She's real sorry!
                         DJANGO
          Goddamit, Big John!

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          I like the way you beg, boy.

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
          yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
          are clumsy. You'd break everything in
          goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
          only known cure for nigger clumsiness
          is a peelin'.

                         BIG JOHN
          After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

                         DJANGO
          John Brittle!         
                         LITTLE RAJ
          Django?
                         DJANGO
          Remember me?

          BIG JOHN FACE
          goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
          heart, at Django.

                         DJANGO
          I like the way you die, boy.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Who are they?

                         DJANGO
          That's John Brittle, and that's his
          little brother Raj.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Where's Ellis?

                         DJANGO
          He's the one hightailin' it across that
          field right now.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Are you sure that's him?
                         

                         DJANGO
          Yes!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Are you positive?

                         DJANGO
          I dunno.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You don't know if you're positive?

                         DJANGO
          I don't know what, positive,'means.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          It means you're sure.

                         DJANGO
          Yes.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes, what?

                         DJANGO
          Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!

                         SPENCER
          Just who the hell are you two jokers?

          Dr. SCHULTZ
          I am Dr. King Schultz, a legal representative
          of the criminal justice system of the
          United States of America. The man to my
          left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
          In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
          court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
          Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
          alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
          Roger Brittle --

                         DJANGO
          - They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You know them by the name, Shaffer.
          But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
          These are wanted men. The law wants them
          for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
          states dead or alive. When Django and myself
          executed these men on sight, we were operating
          within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
          passions are high. But I must warn you,
          the penalty for taking deadly force
          against a officer of the court in the
          performance of his duty is, you will be
          hung by the neck until you are dead.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          May I please remove the warrant from my
          pocket so you may examine it?

                         SPENCER
          Gimmie.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Satisfied.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          May I have that back?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          We good?

                         BENNETT
          Get off my land.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Post haste.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          Load up the bodies as quickly as
          you can, and let's get out of
          here.

                         BENNETT
          Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
          while you on my property. But for lettin' a
          nigger kill a white man, and especially for
          letting a nigger kill a white man in a
          audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
          it out of the county alive. Mark my words
          Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
          gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
          from my motherfuckin' gate.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
          regulator playmates aren't shy about
          killing for what you believe in. But mark
          my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
          towards Django or myself, you better be
          prepared to die for it.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          That's them sonsabitches.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Now unless they start shootin' first,
          nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
          for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
          nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
          personally, strip and clip that garboon
          myself.
                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
          this thing.
                         BRADSHAW
          We ready, or what?

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.
          Shit ...I just made it worse.

                         RANDY
          I can't see shit either.

                         REDFISH
          Who made this goddamn shit?

          0. B.
          Willards wife.

                         WILLARD
          Well make you own goddamn masks!

                         SPENCER
          Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate
          what Jenny did.

                         REDFISH
          Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
          could cut it better then this.

          0. B.
          How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?

                         ROBERT
          Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
          I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
          But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
          all over, and I'm riding blind.

                         RANDY
          Oh shit, I just made mine worse.

                         RANDY
          Yep, it's worse.

                         RANDY
          Did anybody bring any extra bags?

                         TERRY
          No, no one brought a extra bag!


                         RANDY
          I'm just asking.

                         DOUG
          Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

                         SPENCER
          Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
          up, that just defeats the purpose.
                         REDFISH
          I can't see in this fucking thing!
          I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
          And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

                         WILLARD
          Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
          my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
          ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
          And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
          From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!

                         SPENCER
          O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
          not dead.

          O.B.
          But Willards riding off.

                         SPENCER
          Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
          here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
          And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

                         RANDY
          Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
                         ROBERT
          I think we all think the bags was a nice
          idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
          could of been done better. So how 'bout,
          no bags this time, but next time, we do the
          bags right, and then we go full regalia.
                         SPENCER
          Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!

                         TERRY
          But nobody can see.

                         SPENCER
          So?

                         TERRY
          So, it would be nice to see.

                         SPENCER
          Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
          can't see, so what? All that matters is can
          the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Auf wiedersehen.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Let 'em have it!

                         DJANGO
          I can't see nothin'.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Just fire into the smoke.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          He's getting away.

                         DJANGO
          I got 'em.

             

                         
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          He's getting out of range.

                         DJANGO
          I got 'em.

                         DJANGO
          I got 'em.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Like that, huh?

                         DJANGO
          I like.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well, I think while they take this opportunity
          to lick their wounds, we should take this
          opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
          dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
          You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
          You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
          even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
          You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

                         DJANGO
          She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
          If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
          where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
          were sayin' where I gotta go first?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          There'should be some sort of records office.
          You know when she was sold, you know where
          she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
          you know her name ... . what is her name?

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Broomhilda?
          Django.nods his head yes.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Were her owners German?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
          The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
          a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
          speak a little German too.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Your wife?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
          her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          So let me get this straight, your slave
          wife speaks German, and her name is
          Broomhilda Von Shaft...?

                         DJANGO
          Yep. Mouthful, huh?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          To say the least.
          This looks like a very pretty place to have
          our picnic. What'd ya say, here?


                         DJANGO
          How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
          were German?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
          her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

                         DJANGO
          Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
          a character in one of the most popular of
          all the German legends.

                         DJANGO
          Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes there is.

                         DJANGO
          Do you know it?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Every German knows that story. Would you
          like me to tell you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
          daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
          Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

                         DJANGO
          What she do?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
          him in some way. So at first he's just going to
          obliterate her -

                         DJANGO
          Obliterate... . what does that mean?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Like blow up.

                         DJANGO
          Phew, that's pretty mad.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
          little time, he calms down a bit. He's
          still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
          Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
          does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda's on a mountain?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          It's a German legend, there's always going
          to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
          puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
          fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
          And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
          And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
          arises brave enough to save her.

                         DJANGO
          Does a fella arise?
          From now on as DOCTOR SHULTZ talks, he's beginning to realize something he
          wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
          named, Sigfried.

                         DJANGO
          Does Sigfried save her?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
          Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
          a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
          said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
          obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
          his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
          not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
          he's not afraid.of him.
          He walks through hellfire because
          Broomhilda's worth. it.

                         DJANGO
          I know how he feels.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I think I'm just starting to realize that.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
          save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
          let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
          Let me ask you a question, how do you like
          the bounty hunting business?

                         DJANGO
          Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
          What's not to like?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I hafta admit, we make a good team.

                         DJANGO
          But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
          Big John and Rodger?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
          overzealous. But normally, that's a good
          thing. How'd you like to partner up for
          the winter?

                         DJANGO
          What'd ya mean partner up?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
          of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
          of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
          three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
          over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
          Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
          A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
          for the winter.

                         DJANGO
          You makin' another agreement?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes. You work with me through the winter,
          till the snow melts. I give you a third
          of my bounties. And while we're together,
          I'll teach you a few things you're going
          to need to know.

                         DJANGO
          Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
          head bow thing that Fritz can do?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          That among other things. We make some
          money this winter, when the snow melts,
          I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
          we'll find where they sent your wife.
          I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
          No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
          understandably, he's a little suspicious.

                         DJANGO
          Why you care what happens to me? Why you
          care if I find my wife?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well frankly, I've never given anybody
          their freedom before. And now that I have,
          I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
          just not ready to go off on your own, it's
          that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
          Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
          it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
          obliged to help you on your quest to
          rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Keep down or he'll see you.

                         DJANGO
          Who that farmer? Who cares?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
          just might.

                         DJANGO
          What? The little man pushin' that plow?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

                         DJANGO
          Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
          who's hiding out as a farmer, because
          there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
          his head.
          He hands Django the scope rifle case.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          And he's all yours my boy.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
          folks for money?

                         DJANGO
          His son's with him.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
          Maybe even share a last word. That's
          better then most get, and a damn. sight
          better then he deserves.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
          mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

                         DJANGO
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
          The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
          stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
          for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
          hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
          Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
          follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and
          crazy craig koons."
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
          is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
          twenty-two, they would never of printed that.
          But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
          and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
          You want to save your wife by doing what
          I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
          and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
          is worth seven thousand dollars.
          Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

                         DJANGO
          Why?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          It's good luck. You always keep the
          handbill of your first bounty.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          See, they're having a tender little father son
          moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
          they've ever had.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I think it's safe to say you're faster then
          the snowman.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
          and who the hell ya got there?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
          it down to the friendly peace officer.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
          And three of their acolytes.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
          nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
          'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
          snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You're pretty confident aren't you?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You have reason to be.
                         DJANGO
          Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh you're ready for Greenville.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
          sure.

          Good god almighty these niggers stink!

          you can!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          It's a spectacle out of Dante.

                         DJANGO
          You should see it from the other side.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

                         DJANGO
          You'd be surprised what you can endure.
          Where to?

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          On that day, eight months ago, the auction
          was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
          for his fat boy son Scotty.
          Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
          From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
          Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
          the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

                         SCOTTY
          This is for you.

                         SCOTTY
          They're jelly beans. Try one.

                         SCOTTY
          Good huh?
          She nods her head, yes.


                         BROOMHILDA
          Master Scotty... ?

                         SCOTTY
          Yes Broomhilda?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
          you on that seat so we can talk?

                         SCOTTY
          Please, I'd love that.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          What's your name, gal?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Broomhilda.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          Follow me. into the kitchen,
          You stay out here.

          Mrs.HARMONY
          I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
          my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
          girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
          with him, they fool with him for the wrong
          reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
          man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
          He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
          eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
          wrong, you'll deal with me.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
          needs is a little confidence.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          And you'll give that to him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          He is, isn't he?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Ah-huh.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
          bride for young master Scotty that day.
          And the two kids had a nice time playing
          house for awhile.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
          no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
          even join the family at their dinner table.
          We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
          gravy.

          NARRATOR.(VO)
          And pretty soon she was adopted into a
          member of the family.
          Mrs.Harmony and Broomhilda sewing together.
          The Harmony family and Broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard.
          After dinner, Mrs.Harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano.
          Mr.Harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Scotty was never happier.
          Scotty and Broomhilda walking holding hands at Southern magic hour.
          Broomhilda having sex with Scotty, baby talking with him, talking him
          through it, making him feel loved and secure.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          After three months of this bliss,
          Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
          a romantic weekend in Greenville.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          White masters would take their pretty
          Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
          excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
          how bad the other slaves had it, always made
          the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
          position


                          NARRATOR (VO)
          And two, there was a sliver of society that
          ran through Greenville at night that catered
          to white masters who were infected with a
          condition that was normally referred to as,
          "Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
          bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
          white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.


                         NARRATOR (VO)
          But the crown jewel of all this interracial
          frivolity, was the members only, Cleopatra
          Club.

                         SCOTTY
          I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
          I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
          I love you. And if loving you means I go to
          hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Then... speak of the devil and the devil
          appears.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          appears at their table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
          The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
          to welcome an attractive couple'like
          yourselves to my favorite place on earth.

                         SCOTTY
          Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
          We love it here.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          May I join you?-

                         SCOTTY
          Please, by all means.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long have you been a member?

                         SCOTTY
          We just joined this weekend.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well our little private oasis appreciates
          your patronage. Some may consider the dues
          excessive, but they're necessary for us to
          create this haven for the alternative
          lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

                         SCOTTY
          Well said, and money well spent.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It would be.my pleasure, your first
          weekend at the club, to join me and my

          After excusing herself, she walked across
          the street to her hotel room. She got
          her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
          didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
          Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
          home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
          She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
          to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
          scrape every pimple.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
          wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
          card game. As the game wore on, it came down
          to a two thousand dollar pot between
          Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
          for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
          Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
          something in his ear.

                         CANDIE
          Really?
          You know what Sheba just tole me?
                         SCOTTY
          What?

                         CANDIE
          She says she thinks you're cute.

                         SCOTTY
          Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
          beautiful.

                         CANDIE
          Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
          lip. Want some lip?
                         SCOTTY
          Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

                         CANDIE
          Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
          friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.

                         CANDIE
          Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
          brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
          it. If you're really holding cards, time to
          pony up. I raise you five hundred.
          SCOTTY.
          I see your five hundred...
          .and raise you four hundred more.
          Call.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Not so fast, boy.

                         (BEAT)
          Pot ain't fat enough yet.

                         SCOTTY
          I'm all in.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Ain't that too bad.
                         SCOTTY
          I would think a southern gentleman of
          such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
          to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          One final raise.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's Sheba's bill of sale.

                         SCOTTY
          What? I don't want her.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          In Greenville slaves are currency. And
          Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
          I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
          fold?

                         SCOTTY
          I'm all out of money.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But we ain't playin' for money no more..
          We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
          you got.

                         SCOTTY
          I can't bet Broomhilda.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
          or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
          and a pencil.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
          Scotty makes a pressured decision.

                         SCOTTY
          Let me see your cards!
                         SCOTTY
          You cheated me.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What did you just call me?

                         SCOTTY
          I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
          cause that's what you are!
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
          in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
          I challenge you to a duel.
          Piano player, will you hit three separate
          notes?

                         (TO SCOTTY)
          On the third note, pick up the gun and
          try to kill me.
          Piano player please ...
          This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

                         SCOTTY
          Wait a minute ...no!

                         SCOTTY
          I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
          to duel!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then get out of here, get in your buggy
          and get out of town.

                         SCOTTY
          Sure. Let me just get my girl.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You lost that girl, fat boy.

                         SCOTTY
          Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
          called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
          give you Broomhilda.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
          to fuckin' another one.
          Or pick up that gun.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Hello Oliver.

          FRONT DESK CLERK (OLIVER)
          Hello Mr.Candie, good evening.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Good evening to you as well,. young Oliver.
          Could you please inform me which room
          your guest Scott Harmony is staying in?

          INT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
          Broomhilda is asleep in bed...


                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Welcome to Candyland.


                         NARRATOR (VO)
          That was four months ago.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
          owner of Candyland.

                         DJANGO
          Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh, so you heard of it?

                         DJANGO
          Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
          and apparently the repellent gentleman down
          there is the one who owns her.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

                         DJANGO
          Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
          a couple niggers he'd fight.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Can you play a mandingo expert?

                         DJANGO
          What?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
          who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

                         DJANGO
          Why?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Because when a man has one of the four
          biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
          the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
          is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
          his attention, we better be talking about
          big sweaty black males. So my character is
          that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
          in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
          fight game. And your character is the mandingo
          expert I hired to help me do it.

                         DJANGO
          They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
          DOCTOR SHULTZ.
          One-Eyed Charly?

                         DJANGO
          That's what you call it when you buy a slave
          expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
          know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
          He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
          don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
          Dr'. SCHULTZ
          Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?
                         DJANGO
          You know, back on the plantation, my. job
          wasn't historian.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
          legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
          play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
          yes, if you can't.

                         DJANGO
          You want me to play a black slaver? There
          ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
          slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
          buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Can you do that?

                         DJANGO
          That, I can do. What's next?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          To get ourselves personally invited to

                         FRENCH MAID
          Bonjour.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Bonjour, mon petite femme noire.
          We are here to see Calvin Candie.

                         FRENCH MAID
          Enter.

                         HOSTESS
          Hello gentlemen, I'm Cleo, can I help you?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes I am Dr.King Schultz, and this is my
          associate, Django Freeman.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          We're here for a appointment with
                         CLEO
          Yes you gentlemen are expected. Please
          make yourself comfortable. I'll inform
          Monsieur Candie you've arrived.
          Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen
          a tasty refreshment?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Not at the moment.

                         CLEO
          Then Coco will entertain you while I
          inform Monsieur Candie.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          How charming.
          Cleo leaves.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Have you ever seen anything like this
          before?
                         MOGUY
          DOCTOR SHULTZ, good to see you again.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
          in creating the opportunity for this
          appointment.
          Mr.MOGUY
          Nonsense, it's my job.      
          .So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
          so much about.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
          lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.

                         MOGUY
          Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
          room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
          along too?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          We would be quite lucky indeed if the
          charming Coco cared.to follow.
                         MOGUY
          You better watch out doctor, you gonna
          steal this little pony's heart.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          How long have you been associated with
          Mr.Candie?

                         MOGUY
          Calvin and I were about eleven when we
          went to boarding school together. One
          could almost say, I was raised to be
          Calvin's lawyer.

                         DJANGO
          One could almost say, you a nigger.

                         MOGUY
          What did you say?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
          Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
          know before I meet him?

                         MOGUY
          Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What civilized people aren't?

                         MOGUY
          That's why all the French ambiance. And
          he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What ever he prefers.

                         MOGUY
          Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
          French to him, it'll embarrass him.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Why do you want to get in the mandingo
          business?
          That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
          .to make the proper introductions?
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Quit stalling and answer the question.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          The awful truth?
          I'm bored, and it seems like a good
          bit of fun.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
          goin on that's a good bit of fun_
          CALVIN CANDIE.
          The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
          him today. What's his name, Moguy?

                         MOGUY
          Big Fred.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
          Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.
          What's your nigger's name?

                         AMERIGO
          Luigi... .?
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
          a good bit of fun?

                         DJANGO
          You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How'd you two like to try the signature drink
          of the club?

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          We'd love to.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
          don't spare the rum.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
          like you owe me ten dollars.
          Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
      
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's your name, boy?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          His name is Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Where'd ya dig him up?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          A fortuitous turn of events brought
          Django and myself together.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
          real bright boy.
          I'm curious, what makes you such a
          mandingo expert?

                         DJANGO
          I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
          Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

                         BARTHOLOMEW
          What you say, boy?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
          you directed your line of inquiry to me.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
          neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
          if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
          didn't seek you out for your advice. I
          sought you out to purchase a fighting
          nigger at above top dollar market price.
          I was'under the impression when you
          granted me an audience, it would be to
          discuss business.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          No we weren't talking business yet. We
          were discussing my curiosity.
          Now according to Moguy here, if I do
          business with you...
          , .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.
          He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
          but more or less, yes.
          None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
          needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
          So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
          looked over my African flesh, and were
          none too impressed.

                         DJANGO
          Not for top dollar.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well then we got nothing more to talk
          about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
          from me, those are the beat ass niggers
          I wanna sell.

                         DJANGO
          He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
          sell. He wants the nigger you don't
          wanna sell.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
          sell.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ chimes in thoughtfully;-
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You won't sell your best. You won't even
          sell your second best. But your third
          best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
          I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
          forced to consider it... . who knows what
          could happen?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What do you consider ridiculous?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ.
          For a truly talented specimen,
          ."The Right Nigger"..:?
          How much would you say, Django?

                         DJANGO
          Twelve thousand dollars.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
          you got my attention.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How's your Catfish, dew drop?

                         COCO
          Real good Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You spend a lot of time around niggers
          aside from Freeman here?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Not so much.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
          treat this was for 'em. You feel special
          Coco?

                         COCO
          Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You feel special Bartholomew?

                         BARTHOLOMEW
          Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

                         SHEBA
          Yep.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
          special?

                         DJANGO
          Not as special as her.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well we're leaving bright and early
          tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
          kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
          You oughta come with us.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
          suppose I could be amenable to that.
          How far must we trek?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
          in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
          There you can get a look at my best
          specimens. Have dinner with my sister
          and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
          my guest.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Splendid.

                         DJANGO
          Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
                         RODNEY
          No sir.

                         DJANGO
          You want a boot heel in it?

                         RODNEY
          No sir.

                         DJANGO
          Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
          Flash that bad look at me again,
          I'll give ya reason not to like me!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          How do you like this side of the slave
          trade?

                         DJANGO
          Not so much.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Prefer the other side?

                         DJANGO
          I didn't say that.

          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

                         DJANGO
          Are you sure it's her?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          He didn't call her by name, but she's a
          young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
          speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
          assume, in this instance, I think it's
          pretty safe.

                         DJANGO
          Did you offer to buy her?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I opened the door to my possible interest.
          But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
          so interested.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Am I intruding?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Of course not.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I swear you two are cozier then a couple
          of cuttle fish.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You'd be surprised what a good
          conversationalist Django is.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh by now, I don't think that would
          surprise meat all.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          When do we reach your property?
                         CALVIN CANDLE
          You been on it. I own the whole sixty
          miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
          Billy Crash, git up here!

                         BILLY CRASH
          Yeah, Boss?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Find out what that goddamn commotion
          is up at the tracker shack!

                         BILLY CRASH
          Right away, Boss.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know, confidentially, just 'tween
          us girls, worse things about this
          business, ain't the slaves. It's all
          the white trash ya gotta deal with.
          Like these peckawoods we got riding with
          us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
          ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
          niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
          holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
          it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
          And don't think they don't know it either.
          It's about the only thing these dumbass
          motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
          Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
          niggers ass, other than somebody might as
          well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
          boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
          they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
          inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
          gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
          a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
          patience, that German lady taught Hildi
          how to speak German.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
          hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
          understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
          could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
          of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
          to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
          wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
          they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What the hell's goin on?

                         BILLY CRASH
          They got 'em a runaway.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Who?


                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
          a fool thing like run off?

                         D'ARTAGNAN
          I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
          win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
          shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
          myself think!
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
          Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
          Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
          he's just makin' em hungry.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long was he loose?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          A. night. Day. Half the other night.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How far he git off property?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
          considering that limp he got.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
          Friday?.

                         MOGUY
          One of this new lot.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
          wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.
          Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
          a tail on a teddy bear.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
          soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
          Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
          business. Now I done paid five hundred
          dollars for you. And when I pay five
          hundred dollars, I expect to get five
          fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
          and play dead. You've fought three fights.

                         D'ARTAGNAN
          I won every one.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
          muddied the line between winning and losing.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
          dollars, I want five fights. So what
          about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
          reimburse me?
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You even know what reimburse means?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'll reimburse you.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You will?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
          one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
          broom?
                         DJANGO
          No he won't.
                         DJANGO
          He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
          all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
          ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
          we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
          right, Doc?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You heard 'em.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
          jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
          like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
          Mr. Stonesipher?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          That's right.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well now since you won't pay a penny for
          this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
          this nigger however I see fit?

                         DJANGO
          He's your nigger.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
          bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Marsha...git 'em!
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Your boss looks a little green around
          the gills for a blood sport like
          nigger fightin'?
                         DJANGO
          Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
          ripped apart by dogs, is all.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But you are use to it?

                         DJANGO
          Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
          a little more use to American's then
          he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
          ready, we rode five hours so you could
          show off your stock. Let's git to it.
          Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
          ain't impressed.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Follow me.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hello Stephen my boy!

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
          this nigger up on that nag?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
          shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
          on that nag?

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          Hey Snowball.

                         DJANGO
          If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
          my horse, you ask me.

                         STEPHEN
          Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
          horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
          goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
          funny. Django's a Freeman.
                         STEPHEN
          This nigger, here?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
          the two of. you. Django, this is another
          cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
          Stephen, this is Django. You two should
          hate each other.
                         STEPHEN
          Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
          feel the need to entertain?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Django and his friend in grey, DOCTOR SHULTZ
          are customers, and they are our guests
          Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
          .are to show them every hospitality.
          Do you understand that?

                         STEPHEN
          I don't know why I gotta -

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You don't hafta know why, do you
          understand?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Good. They're spending the night. Go up
          in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

                         STEPHEN
          He's gonna stay in the Big House?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

                         STEPHEN
          In the Big House?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You gotta problem with that?

                         STEPHEN
          I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
          problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
          and the pillow cases once this black ass
          motherfuckers gone!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
          Your problem, right now, is making a
          good impression. And I want you to start
          solving that problem right now, and git
          them rooms ready.
                         STEPHEN
          Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          DOCTOR SHULTZ, this attractive southern belle
          is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
          Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
          Django,
          and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony. 
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          And it is our great delight to encounter
          this flaming rose.

                         LARA LEE
          Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
          You're not from around here, are you?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Actually I'm from a far off land,
          Dusseldorf, to be exact.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          These two are in the market for a fightin'
          nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
          show 'em my stock.

                         LARA LEE
          We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Half the reason I invited them. I thought
          you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
          little sister.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know since I started fightin' niggers
          about eleven years ago, it's been a new
          lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
          now is the man responsible for all my
          success.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Howdy Ace.
          This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
          nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
          Ace Woody.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
          Cody.
          Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
          Django Freeman, they're big customers with
          big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
          brought 'em out here so you could give
          'em a little display of our African flesh.
                         ACE WOODY
          Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
                         ACE WOODY
          These the new chickens?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes siree bob.

                         ACE WOODY
          How many you get?
          One, two, three, four, five.

          Those of you with exceptional ability
          will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
          you who don't possess exceptional ability,
          will wish you did.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          We only get about two out of every batch
          of five fighters we buy. But those two
          tend to be lucky.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
          that you don't trust my judgement?
                         ACE WOODY
          Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
          Boss Candie...eventually.

          Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?

                         STEPHEN
          All ready for your guest and his nigger.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you're incorrigible.
          Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
          rooms.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          There you can lie down and rest up
          for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
          some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
          my finer specimens.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Splendid.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
          Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
          of oats.
                         DJANGO
          That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
          care of 'em now.

                         TIMMY
          Yes, sir.
                         DJANGO
          Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
                         DJANGO
          Give that one to Fritz.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
          the nigger girl we were talking about?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Nigger girl?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I believe you said she spoke German?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Do you think before the demonstration you
          could send her around to my room?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I don't see why not.
          Stephen, when you get through showing
          them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
          I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
          and sent over to DOCTOR SHULTZ's room.
          Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

                         STEPHEN
          Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
           somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What?

                         STEPHEN
          Hildi's in The Hot Box.
          This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's she doin' there?

                         STEPHEN
          What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
          she bein punished.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What she do?

                         STEPHEN
          She ran away again.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
          when I was gone?

                         STEPHEN
          Two.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          When did she go?

                         STEPHEN
          Last night. They brought her back this
          morning.
                         CALVIN CANDLE
          How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
          Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
          those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
          motherfuckers right now.

                         STEPHEN
          Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
          D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
          lookin' for her and found her. She a little
          beat up, but she did that to herself.
          Runnin' through them damn bushes.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long she been in the box?

                         STEPHEN
          What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
          fool got ten more days to go.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Take her out.

                         STEPHEN
          Take her out? Why!

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
          my nigger. DOCTOR SHULTZ is my guest. Southern
          hospitality dictates I make her available
          to him.

                         STEPHEN
          But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
          havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
          wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
          I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
          her out.
          Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
          for getting her cleaned up and presentable
          for DOCTOR SHULTZ?
                         STEPHEN
          You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
          little box?

                         STEPHEN
          This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
          nice too.
                         STEPHEN
          Feel free to touch anything you want,
          cause we burnin' all this shit once you
          gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
          door when the demonstration ready.

                         DJANGO
          He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
          That's all that needs to be said.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Hello ladies.
                         LARA LEE
          DOCTOR SHULTZ, may I introduce to you,
          Hildi. Hildi, this is DOCTOR SHULTZ, he
          speaks German.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I've been informed you do as well.

                         BROOMHILDA
          It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
          in German.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Astonishing.
          Please come inside Fraulein.
          She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
          "Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
          to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          They call you Hildi, but your real name
          is Broomhilda, isn't it?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes. How do you know that?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Stands to reason who ever taught you
          German would also give you a German name.
          Can I pour you a glass of water,
          Broomhilda?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
          a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
          I'm only speaking German to you now,
          Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
          listening to us. Myself and a mutual
          friend of ours, have gone through a lot
          of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
          find you fraulein - to rescue you.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Please drink.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
          intention to take you away from here
          forever.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I don't got any friends.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes you do.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Who?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
          flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
          surprise you.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Where is he?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Standing right behind that door.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Promise me you won't scream?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Say, I promise.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I promise.
                          DJANGO
           Hey Little Trouble Maker.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You silver tongued devil you.

                         STEPHEN
          What you. whistlin', girl?
                         STEPHEN
          What was you whistlin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Oh nuttin'.

                         STEPHEN
          You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
          whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
          no.name.
                         STEPHEN
          It's kinder pretty.
                         STEPHEN
          That was a compliment.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Thank you.
                         STEPHEN
          I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
          such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
          run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
          Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
          The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
          you are two days later, whistlin' while you
          work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
          have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
          .I'm jus' sayin'.
                         BROOMHILDA
          I'm done here, may I be excused?

                         STEPHEN
          Yes you may.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
          specimens, no doubt about it. But the
          best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
          and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
          called Eskimo Joe?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
          get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
          day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
          best, and you'll never sell him and I can
          see why, he's a champion.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          All three are champions.
                         DJANGO
          Samson's the champion. The other two
          are pretty good.

                         LARA LEE
          Hildi!
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
          take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
          best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
          long as you don't put 'em up against those
          two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

                         DJANGO
          Maybe.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
          admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
          game, I do have a bit of a background in
          the European traveling circus. Hence, I
          have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
          I need something more then just a big nigger.
          He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
          I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
          I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
          for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
          Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
          but is he right as rain ... ?
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          DOCTOR SHULTZ, i will have you know, there
          is no one in the nigger fight game that
          appreciates the value of showmanship
          more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
          one must not forget the most important
          thing in the nigger fight game.
          A nigger that can win fights. That should
          be your first, second, third, four, and
          fifth concern. After you have that, and
          you know you have that, then, you can
          start to implement a grande design. But
          since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
          status - beating Moguy by one year for
          that honor allow the old sage to advise,
          first things first.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I see you two gettin' on?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Famously.
          Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
          it's like not to hear you native tongue
          for four years.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I can't express the joy I felt conversing
          in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
          charming conversation companion.
                         LARA LEE
          I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
          the German sweet talk you want, but it
          looks like this ponys got big eyes for
          Django.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
          a drink in this house in twenty years.

                         STEPHEN
          When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
          a COLD drink.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Did you overhear that joke I said about
          me spending two weeks in Boston

                         STEPHEN

                         (MOCK INDIGNANT)
          You don't have any idea the work I do
          to see food gets on the table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What does that hafta do with the price of
          Tea in China?

                         STEPHEN
          You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
          nothin' better to do then listen in here
          to you tellin' unfunny jokes?
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What? They laughed!

                         STEPHEN
          Of course they laughed, their parents
          raised them right. When they're a guest
          in somebody's house, and the master of
          of the house thinks he's- funny, you
          suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          No it was really funny,
          wasn't it?

                         STEPHEN
          Now what do you expect these people to
          say? What you need to do is stop
          embarrassing your guest.
          Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
          polite, I understand, you mean well, but
          it just encourages him.
                         STEPHEN
          You know that nigger?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Who?

                         STEPHEN
          Don't stall me bitch, you know who?

                         BROOMHILDA
          At the table? I don't know him.

          STEPHEN.
          You don't know him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          No.

                         STEPHEN
          You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
                         STEPHEN
          Okay, if you say so.

                         DJANGO
          Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
          about it. But if it was my money, I
          wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
          for him.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What would your price be?

                         DJANGO
          Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
          and I don't know why I would be inclined
          to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
                         MOGUY
          But the real question is, not how much
          he cost, but how much he can earn?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Django?

                         DJANGO
          In a years time, seven or eight fights -
          outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
          pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...

                         DJANGO
          Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
          one thousand dollars.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
          you cut that cake, that spells profit.
          Not to, mention a years worth of action at
          the big table in a blood sport with a
          winner nigger. However let me reclarify
          how this whole negotiation came about.
          It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
          nigger, it was you who approached me to
          buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
          figure Bright Boy was banding about,
          ain't too far off from right. And if I
          wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
          could sell 'em any day of the week.
          But like you said in Greenville doctor,
          I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
          ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
          dollars that would make me consider it.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
          the power of persuasion.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
          Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          However, that is a tremendous amount of
          money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
          I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
          Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
          up a legal contract before I would feel
          comfortable exchanging that amount of
          money for flesh. Not to mention having
          Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
          choosing. So say I return in about five
          days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
          Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
          the finer points between themselves.


                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Splendid.
          Stephen, time for dessert!

                         BROOMHILDA
          Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may, Hildi.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
          table in the big house?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's a lot better then sizzling in that
          hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
          bramble bush, ain't it?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes 'em.
                         STEPHEN
          You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
          be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
          back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
          where he from.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
          just speak German, or did ya git her
          clothes off?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          We just spoke.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So you haven't seen her back?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          No I haven't.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then Stephen's right, you would probably
          find this interesting. Hildi, take off
          your dress, and show us your back.
                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
          and looking nice.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But Lara Lee, DOCTOR SHULTZ is from Dusseldorf,
          they don't got niggers there. And he's a
          man of medicine. I'm sure it would
          fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
          pain. I mean Hildi got something like
          fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
          one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
          are tough, no doubt about it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
          Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
          During the brandies.
                         STEPHEN
          I thought you said you didn't know him?
                         BROOMHILDA
          Huh?
                         STEPHEN
          I said, you said, you didn't know him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I don't.

                         STEPHEN
          Yes you do.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Mister Stephen, I don't.

                         STEPHEN
          Why you lyin to me?
                         BROOMBILDA
          I ain't.

                         STEPHEN
          Why you cryin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Because you're scarin' me.

                         STEPHEN
          Why am I scarin' you?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Because you're scary.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ (OS)
          .to speak German,with Hildi this
          afternoon was positively soul enriching.
                         STEPHEN
          You, stay in the kitchen.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          You indicated earlier you would be
          willing to part with Hildi?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes siree bob I did.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well in that case allow me to propose
          another proposition?
                         STEPHEN
          - Monsieur Candie?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you just interrupted DOCTOR SHULTZ.

                         STEPHEN
          Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
          ain't worth a damn these days.

                         (TO CANDIE)
          Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
          the kitchen.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What, you mean get outta my chair?

                         STEPHEN
          If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What about dessert?

                         STEPHEN
          I would rather tell you in private.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
          melodrama could be brewing back there?

                         STEPHEN
          Meet me in the library.
          Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
          has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
          library" is their secret signal.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
          they are in the kitchen, from time to
          time, adult supervision is required.
          If you'll excuse me a moment.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's the matter?

                         STEPHEN
          Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
          mandingos. They want that girl. -

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What the hell you talkin' about?

                         STEPHEN
          They playin your ass for a fool, that's
          what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
          for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
          that girl.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What girl, Hildi?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          He just bought Eskimo Joe.

                         STEPHEN
          Did he give you any money?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well not yet, but -

                         STEPHEN
          - Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
          how. But he was just about to buy, who he
          came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
          Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
          go through all that trouble, to. buy a
          nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
          five hundred dollars?

                         STEPHEN
          Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
          love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
          Now why that German gives a fuck about
          who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
          with, I'm sure I don't know.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          If she's who they want, why the whole
          snake oil pitch about mandingos?

                         STEPHEN
          Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
          to four hundred dollar. But twelve
          thousand got you real friendly.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
          sonsabitches!

                         (LOUDER)
          Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
          fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
          .gonna have us a Candyland tar and
          feathering!

                         STEPHEN
          Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
          seein' something like that ... . but why
          don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
          huckster insinuate themselves at my
          dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
          plantation for a fool!

                         STEPHEN
          Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
          discuss this.

                         STEPHEN
          Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
          was something up with these two. We just
          didn't know what. But now we do. They
          don't want you to know how bad they want
          that girl. But these ole boys have rode
          a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
          trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
          bull to get this girl. They must want her
          mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
          changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
          wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
          changed is the advantage.

                         (BEAT)
          Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
          and busts these motherfucker's chops.
                         LARA LEE
          There you are! I was beginning to think
          you and that of crow ran off together.
                         CALVIN CANDLE
          That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
          Lara Lee?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
          Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
          shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
          Would you be a dear and go out there and
          give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
          knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
          But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
          your shoulder?
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now lay your palms flat on the table top.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now you lift those palms off that turtle
          shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
          loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
          There's been a lotta lies said around this
          table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.
          Mr. Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
          the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
          
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
          were just getting ready to make me a
          proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Right.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen! Bring out Hildi!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now it should be quite clear by now I know
          you're not here to buy no mandingos.
          Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
          want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
          to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
          you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
          horseshit.

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Stephen, put her in that chair.
          Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
          With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
          silently watch Candie's next move.
          Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
          You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
          sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
          DOCTOR SHULTZ, you yourself said, "For the Right
          Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
          consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
          myself said, "What is your definition of
          ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
          thousand dollars."
          Now considering you two have ridden a whole
          lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
          and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
          purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
          appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
          And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
          Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I take it you prefer the take it or leave
          it style of negotiating.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
          Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
          anything with my property I so desire.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          And if you think my price for this nigger
          is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
          is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
          death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
          this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          May I lift my hands from the table top in
          order to remove my billfold?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
          jacket, and says;,
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Easy come, easy go.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Pleasure doin' business with you.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Rhubarb pie?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          No.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
          of ya?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Actually, I was thinking of that poor
          devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
          And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
          all this.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dumas...?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
          I figured you must be an admirer. You named
          your slave after that novel's lead character.
          If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
          wonder what he would of made of it?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You doubt he'd approve?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
          at best.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Soft hearted Frenchy?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas is black.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          We got it, let's go.
          Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
          auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
          actually means is, till I see you again,
          and since I never wish to see you again,
          to you sir, I say, goodbye.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          One more moment, Doc!
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's a custom here in the South, once a
          business deal is concluded, for the two
          parties to shake hands. It implies good
          faith.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'm not from the South.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
          I must insist.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Insist what...? That I shake your hand
          before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
          insist in the opposite direction.
                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know what I think you are?
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          What you think I am? No I don't.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          I think you are a bad loser.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          And I think you're an abysmal winner.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
          a deal ain't done till the two parties have
          shook hands. Even after all this paper
          signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
          away twelve thousand dollars...?
          I don't think so.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Let's go.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
          before this German shakes my hand.
          Cut 'er down.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ.
          You really want me to shake your hand?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I insist.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          Well, if you insist.
          DOCTOR SHULTZ
          I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

                         TIMMY
          Act like you still sleepin'.

                         DJANGO
          Where's Broomhilda?

                         TIMMY
          Who?

                         DJANGO
          Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
          couple of days ago. They had her in The
          Hot Box.

                         TIMMY
          I don't know 'bout no girl.

                         DJANGO
          How 'bout that German white man I came
          here with?

                         TIMMY
          Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
                         ACE WOODY
          Git on outta here, boy!

                         ACE WOODY
          So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
                         ACE WOODY
          I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
          We found your wanted posters and book of figures
          in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
          heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
          boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
          line of work?
                         DJANGO
          Well, it turns out I was a natural.
                         ACE WOODY
          Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.

                         ACE WOODY
          See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
          'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
          everyone 'round here blames you.
                         ACE WOODY
          Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
          goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
          hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
          However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
          able to attend.

                         ACE WOODY
          Now I understand you didn't really have
          nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
          sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
          to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
          asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
          But grieving folks 'round here need someone
          to blame. And I guess they figure if you
          hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
          in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
          And you know what, they got a point.

                         ACE WOODY
          Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
          the error of his ways, believe me when I.
          tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
          book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
          there try an' git creative with the way they
          bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
          methods are, tried and true.

                         ACE WOODY
          You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
          me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
          training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
          money I made my whole goddamn life.
          And no end in sight, neither.
          Then you came along. Knocked me right off
          that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
          Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
          mandingos as her brother?
          Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
          is you done fucked up my good thang.
          So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
          could say I gotta axe to grind.

                         ACE WOODY
          How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
          your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
          the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
                         ACE WOODY
          Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.
          On the count of three.
                         DJANGO

          no!!!!

                         ACE WOODY

          one...

                         DJANGO

          No don't do it!!!!!

                         ACE WOODY
          Got to do it, boy. TWO...

                         DJANGO

          no!!!!!
                         STEPHEN
          Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
          talk about the Old Man's funeral.
          Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
          Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
          Dickey people.
                         ACE WOODY
          Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.

                         ACE WOODY
          How disappointing.

                         ACE WOODY
          Where she at?

                         STEPHEN
          She in the big house. The kitchen.
                         ACE WOODY
          You gonna look after our friend?
                         STEPHEN
          Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
          01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
          upside down nigger we both know, gonna
          have us a big of chat.

                         STEPHEN
          Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
          stick is all nice and FROSTY.

                         STEPHEN
          I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
          on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
          Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
          You get the idea to go to Greenville -
          look up the Ole Man there.
          That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
          believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
          buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
          to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
          whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
          Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
          goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
          Big House.
                         STEPHEN
          And that's where you met me. And that's when
          you knew your goose was cooked.
                         STEPHEN
          Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
          didn't know what's what. He still thought his
          ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
          you are, you always know the end is near
          'fore the white folks.
                         STEPHEN
          Damn Nigger, you smell good.

                         STEPHEN
          You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
          bed in the quest room in the Big House -
          After you slapped my ass to the floor
          You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
          ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
          Remember that, Bright Boy?

                         STEPHEN
          You leavin', that's what you can take
          with you.

                         STEPHEN
          Now you were quite the topic of conversation
          for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
          never had a bright idea in their life, was
          comin' up with different ways to kill your
          ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
          wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
          like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
          niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
          "Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
          Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
          "Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
          mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
          And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
          We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
          the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
          worse then that."
                         STEPHEN
          So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
          your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
          And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
          you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
          every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
          And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
          'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
          the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
          Like them three y'all came back with. For them
          big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
          'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
          I give two or three.
                         DJANGO
          Where's Broomhilda?

                         STEPHEN
          She's all right for now. Miss Lara
          soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
          to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
          Now Billy Crash might not look or
          smell too good, but ain't nobody
          gonna bother her.

                         ROY
          It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
          the big boss. Let's git the niggers and

          We get a little money to send back home, and

          How would you like to make eleven thousand

          Keep riding, just ride slower.

                         DJANGO
          Back at that plantation Candyland, there
          was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar

                         JANO
          You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.

                         DJANGO
          That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
          not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
          earn it.

                         JANO
          If you got something to say, say it.

                         DJANGO
          The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
          waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
          form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
          Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

                         JANO
          Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

                         DJANGO
          Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
          gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
          There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
          bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
          dollars for each of his three accomplices,
          Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
          And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
          there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
          cause they just got away with murder.
          But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
          mates could get that money.

                         JANO
          Who pays the money?

                         DJANGO
          The Court.

                         JANO
          The Court?

                         DJANGO
          The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
          the way, the court don't give a damn about
          how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
          back, from up on a hill, in the back of
          the head, in their sleep - don't matter.
                         DJANGO
          Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
          long as you do it.

                         JANO
          They.pay us to kill 'em?

                         DJANGO
          No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
          corpse. Get it?

                         JANO
          I think so... . what did these jokers do again?

                         DJANGO
          Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
          robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.

          What's this?

                         DJANGO
          I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty

          Whatsamatter, can't you read?

                         JANO
          I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
          I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
          think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.

                         DJANGO
          What about that cowboy fella in the lead?

                         JANO

                         DJANGO
          Can Roy read?

                         JANO
          Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin
          read. I just don't got my glasses.
                         DJANGO
          I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
          a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
          Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
          Candyland on a horse with my white German
          partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
          Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
          Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
          Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
          went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
          Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
          blame me, so here I am.
          You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
          know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
          But those four men, are still back there.
          They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
          five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
          last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
          and gittin it.
                         ROY
          What's your deal? You tell us who they are
          and we let ya go?

                         DJANGO
          I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
          me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
          dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
          and I'll point 'em out to you.
          He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
          one little push.

                         DJANGO
          Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
          truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
          me in the same cage with them without them
          killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
          .am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
          there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

                         ROY
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
          The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
          robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
          One thousand five hundred dollars for each
          of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

                         FLOYD
          Just because the handbill's real doesn't
          mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

                         ROY
          Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
          or alive handbill in his pocket?
                         ROY
          That black's damn convincing.
                         ROY
          That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
                         ROY
          I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
          like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
          he ride in with a white man yesterday?
                         CHESTER
          Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
          Auction and he rode on a horse with a
          white man.

                         ROY
          This white man, was the black his slave?

                         RODNEY
          He weren't no slave.

                         FLOYD
          You sure about that?

                         RODNEY
          Damn sure.
          Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
          seriously.

                         ROY
          What happened at Candyland?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

                         ROY
          Who shot 'em?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          The German.

                         ROY
          And why did he do that?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          The nigger and the German were actin as if they
          were slavers, but they weren't.

                         ROY

          Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
          in the chest...
