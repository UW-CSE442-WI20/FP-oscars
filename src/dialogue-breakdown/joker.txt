              --is it just me, or is it getting
              crazier out there?

                         SOCIAL WORKER
              It's certainly tense. People are
              upset, they're struggling. Looking
              for work. The garbage strike seems
              like it's been going on forever.
              These are tough times.
              How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
              enjoying it?

                          JOKER
              Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
              day, so   I really like that. I don't
              think I   could ever work in an
              office.   Behind a desk.
             No offense.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Have you been keeping up with your
          journal?

                       JOKER
          Everyday.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Great. Did you bring it with you?


                    JOKER
          I'm sorry. Did I bring what?

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Arthur, last time I asked you to
          bring your journal with you. For
          these appointments. Do you have it?

                       JOKER
          Yes ma'am.


                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Can I see it?

                    JOKER
          I've been using it as a journal,
          but also a joke diary. Funny
          thoughts or, or observations-- Did
          I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
          stand-up comedy?


                    SOCIAL WORKER
          No. You didn't.

                    JOKER
          I think I did.
                                                            3.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Oh yeah. Because of what your
          mother said,-- about your purpose.
          "To bring laughter and joy to the
          world," right?

                    JOKER
          Right.

                    JOKER
          I didn't realize you wanted to read
          it.



                    SOCIAL WORKER
          "I just hope my death makes more
          sense than my life."

                    JOKER
          Yeah. I mean, that's just--

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Does my reading it upset you?


                    JOKER
          No. I just,-- some of it's
          personal. You know?

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          I understand. I just want to make
          sure you're keeping up with it.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          What about your mom? How's she
          feeling?

                    JOKER
          She has good days. But mostly bad.
          It's been a big help having me
          there. She really needs me.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Seems like she's been sick a lot
          since you got home.

                     JOKER
          Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
          was in the hospital, after my last
          episode-- she was having trouble
          getting over there to visit.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          All right. So, I'll see you again,
          two weeks from today?

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Is there something else I can help
          you with, Arthur? My next
          appointment is waiting.


                    JOKER
          Yeah, I was wondering if you could
          ask the doctor to increase the
          dosage on my medications? Nothing
          seems to make a difference.

                     SOCIAL WORKER
          Do you know which ones you'd like
          increased?


                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Have you been sleeping?
                                                              5.


                        JOKER
              Some.


                        SOCIAL WORKER
              Arthur, you're on seven different
              medications. Surely they must be
              doing something.


                        JOKER
              I just don't wanna feel so bad
              anymore.
                        KID #1
              Suck my dick, clown.


                        KID #2
              Whoops.


                         WOMAN ON BUS
              Can you please stop bothering my
              kid?

                        JOKER
              I wasn't bothering her, I was--

                         WOMAN ON BUS
              Just stop.

                            WOMAN ON BUS
                  You think that's funny?

                        SOPHIE (OS)
              Wait!!


                         SOPHIE
              Thank you.
              Of course it's you,-- everyone else
              in this building is just so fucking
              rude.

                        SOPHIE
              How's your mom doing?

    
                        JOKER
              It's day to day. I'm doing
              everything I can to get her back on
              her feet.
                  (re: pharmacy bag)
              Picked up her medicine. Gonna make
              her some dinner.
                                                            10.


                        SOPHIE
              She's lucky she has you--


                        SOPHIE
              Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How
              many times have I told you that?
              This building is so awful, isn't
              it?


                        SOPHIE
              Okay. Well, tell your mom I said
              hello.



                        JOKER
              Hey Sophie--


                        JOKER
              I'll tell my mom you said hello.

                        MOM (OS)
              Happy?! Did you check the mail
              before you came up?

                        JOKER
              Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.

                        MOM (OS)
              You sure you looked? Sometimes I
              don't know where your head is.


                        JOKER
              Yes I'm sure. And my head's right
              here. I'm gonna make you some
              dinner, okay?

                        MOM
              He must not be getting my letters.


                    JOKER
          He's a busy man.

                    MOM
          Too busy for me? I worked for that
          family for 12 years. He always had
          a smile for me. Least he could do
          is write back.

                    JOKER
          Ma, eat. You need to eat.

                    MOM
          You need to eat. Look how skinny
          you are.


                    MOM
          All day long it's more bad news.
          That's all there is.

                    JOKER
          Maybe you shouldn't watch so much
          television.

                    MOM
          He's the only hope for Gotham.
          He'll make a great mayor. Everybody
          says so.

                    JOKER
          Everybody who? Who do you talk to?

                    MOM
          Well everybody on the news.

                    JOKER
          Stop it. He's not even gonna run.
          Why would Thomas Wayne want to be
          mayor? He can do more good as a
          businessman.

                    MOM
          Because he cares about this city.
          And everyone in it-- that's why I
          can't believe he hasn't written me
          back.

                    JOKER
          He will. Now eat some dinner.


                    JOKER
          How you feeling today?

                    MOM
          I don't know. It always hits me
          worse at night, you notice that?


                    JOKER
          Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a
          werewolf?

                    MOM
          It's not funny.

                    MOM
          Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.
          A better one. I want you to hand
          deliver it to him.

                       JOKER
          What? Why?

                    MOM
          Cause maybe the mailman is throwing
          them away. We should have tipped
          him at Christmas time.

                    JOKER
          Who tips their mailman?

                    MOM
          Some people do. Rich people do.

                    JOKER
          Okay. I can try his office.
          Tomorrow.


                          MOM
               Thank you.
               Come sit. It's almost on.

               Mr. Thomas Wayne.

                         RECEPTIONIST
               Okay. You can leave it with me.

                         JOKER
               It's kind of important. I need to
               make sure he gets it himself.

                         RECEPTIONIST
               Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you
               right in.

                         RECEPTIONIST
               I'm kidding. Leave it here.


                         JOKER
               Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to
               work for the Wayne family-- for 12
               years. She was their housekeeper.

                         RECEPTIONIST
               That's great. But you can leave it
               with me or you can leave with the
               letter. Those are your options. Now
               please step aside.

                         JOKER
               Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe
               at least call back to him? Tell him
               that I'm here.

                         RECEPTIONIST
               Thomas Wayne is away on business.


                         JOKER

                    RANDALL
          I heard about the beat down you
          took. Fucking savages.

                    JOKER
          It was just a bunch of kids. I
          should have left it alone.


                    RANDALL
          It's crazy out there. And it's only
          getting worse.

                     JOKER
          My mother says that the people
          nowadays lack empathy.

                    RANDALL
          What's empathy?

                    JOKER
          It means like "feeling for other
          people."

                    RANDALL
          Like sympathy?

                    JOKER
          Kind of. But different.

                    RANDALL
          Take it. I got a few. You gotta
          protect yourself out there, buddy.
          Too many wackos.


                    RANDALL
          It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job
          done if you ever need to use it.
          Usually pulling it out is enough.

                         RANDALL
               Don't sweat it. You can pay me some
               other time. You're my boy.

   
                         RANDALL
               But you didn't get it from me,
               okay?

               What for?

                           GARY
               No clue.


                         JOKER
               Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to
               see me?

                   (without even looking up)
               How's the comedy career? Are you a
               famous stand-up yet?

                         JOKER
               Not quite. Haven't even performed
               yet. Just been working my material.
               This business is all about fine-
               tuning.


                       HOYT
          Right.


                    HOYT
          Don't sit. This will be quick.


                     HOYT
          Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of
          the guys here, they think you're a
          freak. But I like you. I don't even
          know why I like you. I mean, you
          don't say much.
          It's probably that stupid laugh. It
          gets me every time. Kills me.


                    HOYT
          But I got another complaint. And
          it's starting to piss me off.


                    HOYT
          Kenny's Music. Sunday. The guy said
          you disappeared. Never even
          returned his sign.

                    JOKER
          No. I got jumped. I told you about
          that.

                    HOYT
          For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no
          sense, just give him his sign back.
          He's going out of business for

          Hey!


                         HOYT
               What the fuck, Arthur?!

                         JOKER
               I don't have his sign.                                   

                         MOM
               --so what did he say when you gave
               him the letter?

                         JOKER
               They wouldn't let me see him.
               But they promised me it would get
               to him.

                         MOM
               It's good they promised. He only
               works with the best. We should hear
               something soon.


                          JOKER
               Look up.


                         JOKER
               Why are these letters so important
               to you, Ma? What do you think he's
               gonna do?

                         MOM
               He's gonna help us.

                         JOKER
               Help us how?
                                                             22.


                         MOM
               Get us out of here, take me away
               from this place and these-- these
               awful people.

                         JOKER
               You worked for him over 30 years
               ago. What makes you think he would
               help you?


                         MOM
               Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.
               If he knew how I was living, if he
               saw this place, it would make him
               sick. I can't explain it to you any
               better than that.


                         JOKER
               I don't want you worrying about
               money. Everyone's been telling me
               they think my stand-up is ready for
               the big clubs. It's just a matter
               of time before I get a break.


                         MOM
               Happy, what makes you think you
               could do that?

                         JOKER
               What do you mean?

                         MOM
               I mean, don't you have to be funny
               to be a comedian?


                         MOM (OS)
               Happy!? What was that?

                         JOKER
               What?!

 

                         MOM (OS)
               That Noise! Did you hear that noise?

  
                         JOKER
               I'm watching an old war movie.

                         MOM (OS)
               Turn it down!

    
                         MOM
               It's so loud.


                         JOKER
               I know. The Americans are really
               giving it to the Japs.

                         JOKER
               I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.


                          JOKER
               Why didn't Randall tell me the gun
               was loaded? He's my friend. With my
               luck, I could have killed someone.
               I could have killed myself.

                         JOKER
               I should have killed myself.

   
                         JOKER
               I should kill myself.

               Hello. I'd like to open an account.


                         SOPHIE
               Hey, what are you doing up here?


                    JOKER
          Oh, hi. That's weird.
          I didn't know you worked at a bank.

                    SOPHIE
          Pretty glamorous, right?


                    JOKER
          Very glamorous. Look at this place.


                    JOKER
          I'm a comedian. I do stand-up
          comedy.

                    SOPHIE
          Really? I had no idea.

                    JOKER
          Yeah. You know, I'm always making
          funny observations. Always on the
          look out for my next bit-- so it
          makes sense.

                    SOPHIE
          Right. Anyway, is there something I
          could help you with?


                    JOKER
          I said hi to my mom.

                       SOPHIE
          Excuse me?

                    JOKER
          Last week. You said to say hi to my
          mom. I did. Made her day.

               Everything is fine Mr. Slotnick.


                         SOPHIE
               No. He's not. He's interested in
               opening an account.

                         BRANCH MANAGER
               Great. You just need to fill out a
               form. They are back there-- against
               the wall.

 

                          JOKER
               Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you
               as well, Miss.


                         JOKER
               You know what?! I forgot my ID!

               Hoyt, let me explain.

                         HOYT (OVER PHONE)
               Oh, this'll be good. Please tell me
               why you brought a gun into a sick
               kid's ward?

                         JOKER
               It was, it was a prop gun. It's
               part of my act now.
                                                         30.


                    HOYT (OVER PHONE)
          Bullshit. Jingles would never carry
          a fucking gun. Besides, Randall
          told me you tried to buy a .38 off
          him last week.


                    JOKER
          Randall told you that?

                    HOYT (OVER PHONE)
          He was with me when the call came
          in. You're a fuck up, Arthur. And a
          liar. You're fired.

                    JOKER
          Hoyt--

                     HOYT (OVER PHONE)
          Say it, Arthur.
          Let me hear you say it.

                    JOKER
          Say what?

                    HOYT (OVER PHONE)
          I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.

          Okay. Well, all the info is right
          there on the flyer.


                    JOKER
          You know they say laughter is the
          best medicine.

                    SOPHIE
          Is that what they say?

               We spoke about this last time,
               Arthur. You're supposed to bring
               your journal with you.

                         JOKER
               Well I didn't think you were going
               to read it.

                         SOCIAL WORKER
               You said it didn't bother you.

                         JOKER
               I lied. Everything bothers me.

                         SOCIAL WORKER
               What about it bothered you?

                         JOKER
               It's personal. It's my private
               thoughts. Plus it contains original
               comedy material that I don't feel
               comfortable handing over to you.

                         SOCIAL WORKER
               Arthur, I have some bad news for
               you.


                         SOCIAL WORKER
               They've cut our funding. We're
               closing down our offices next week.

  

                         JOKER
               So where will we be meeting?


                         SOCIAL WORKER
               We won't be. The city's cut funding
               across the board. Social services
               is part of that.


                         JOKER
               Okay.

                         SOCIAL WORKER
               They don't give a shit about people
               like you, Arthur. You don't have a
               voice and they don't really care
               what happens to you or to us for
               that matter.


                         JOKER
               How am I gonna get my medication?


                         MOM (OS)
               Happy! Come in here. Thomas Wayne
               is on TV.

                         MOM (OS)
               Quick! Come.

                         MOM
               They're interviewing him about
               those horrible murders on the
               subway last week.

                    JOKER
          Why are they talking to him?


                    THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
          --as you know, Jerry, all three of
          them worked at Wayne Investments,
          and they were the best of the best.
          Solid young men.

                    THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
          And while I didn't know them
          personally, like all Wayne
          employees, past and present, they
          were family.

                    MOM
          You hear that! I told you. We're
          family.

                    "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
          There now seems to be a groundswell
          of anti-rich sentiment in the city.
          It's almost as if our less
          fortunate residents have taken the
          side of the killer.

                    THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
          Yes and it's a shame. It's one of
          the reasons I'm considering a run
          for mayor. Gotham has lost its way.

                    "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
          Are you announcing your candidacy?

                    THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
          No comment.

                         "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
               What about the eyewitness report of
               the suspect being a man in clown
               make-up or a clown mask-- Care to
               comment on that?



                         THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
               It makes total sense to me. What
               kind of coward would do something
               that cold-blooded? Someone who
               hides behind a mask. Someone who's
               envious of those more fortunate
               than themselves, yet too scared to
               show their own face.
                   (to camera)
               And until that jealousy ends, those
               of us who've made a good life for
               ourselves will always look at those
               who haven't as nothing but clowns.

                         EMCEE (OS)
               This next comic describes himself
               as a lifelong Gotham resident who
               from a young age was always told
               that "his purpose in life was to
               bring joy and laughter into this
               cold, dark world." Ummm. Okay.

                         EMCEE (OS)
               Please help me welcome Arthur
               Fleck!

               -- good evening, hello.
               Good to be here.
               I, I hated school as a kid. But myher would always say,--
                 
               "You should enjoy it. One day
               you'll have to work for a living."
               "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
               comedian!"

                    JOKER
          So, did you laugh? Really couldn't
          see much from up there.

                    SOPHIE
          Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear
          anything?

                    JOKER
          All I heard was my heart pounding.

                     SOPHIE
          It was good. I really needed to get
          out of my apartment so, thanks.
          What happened to the rest of your
          friends?

                    JOKER
          What friends?

                    SOPHIE
          Didn't you say some of your friends
          were coming?

                    JOKER
          Yeah, I decided not to invite them.
          As a performer sometimes you want
          to see how a "real" crowd reacts.
          People who don't already love me,
          or, or have a notion of who I am,
          you know?

                    SOPHIE
          Yeah. I get that.

                    SOPHIE (OS)
          You believe that shit?

                    JOKER
          Yeah,-- I don't know how something
          like that happens.

                    SOPHIE
          Please. I'll bet you five bucks
          those rich assholes deserved it.

                       JOKER
          You think?

                    SOPHIE
          Look at their faces. Those smug
          smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck
          them.


                    SOPHIE
          The guy who did it is a hero. Three
          less pricks in Gotham City. Woo-
          hoo! Only a million more to go.

                    JOKER
          Hey. You want to get some coffee?

                         SOPHIE
               --I'm telling you, it's across the
               board. Wall Street, the banks,
               politicians. They've been making a
               killing for years. Fuck them.


                         JOKER
               I don't know.

                         SOPHIE
               What don't you know?

                         JOKER
               Not all of them are awful. Take
               someone like Thomas Wayne for
               example. He's a hero.

                         SOPHIE
               Oh c'mon, he's the worst!


                         JOKER
               Sophie, he's the only one who can
               save this city.

                         SOPHIE
               You can't be serious!? He's a
               complete narcissist. Brags about
               his money. Meanwhile, the rest of
               us can barely make rent. Or feed
               our kids.


                         JOKER
               What happened?

                            SOPHIE
               With what?


                    JOKER
          With your job. At the bank?

                    SOPHIE
          Oh. Yeah, I was, um,--

          We don't have to talk about it.

          And have you ever wanted to torch                    
          the place?

          Right. And this was like the first                   
          good job I had in like, years. Not                   
          waitressing or anything like that.                   
          It was 9-5. I had benefits. You                      
          know what that means when you have                   
          a kid?                                                                             

                    SOPHIE                                     
          But from the very first day, the                     
          manager guy starts smiling at me,                    
          whispering in my ear, touching me,                   
          trying to get me to sleep with him--                 

                    JOKER                                      
          Did you do it? Did you go to bed                     
          with him?                                            


                    SOPHIE                                        
          Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig.                       
          So finally I complained to his                          
          boss, and they fired me... And now,                     
          now I don't know what to do with                        
          myself.                                                 

                    JOKER                                         
          Right. Wait, what do you mean?                          

                    SOPHIE                                        
          I finally felt good. Like I had a                       
          future. A purpose. And now I don't                      
          even know how I'm gonna pay my                          
          rent.                                                   


                    JOKER
          I'm sorry. I have this thing--

                    SOPHIE                                        
          I know.                                                 
                                                    

                    SOPHIE                                        
          How did you get it?

                    JOKER
          I don't know. I read you can get it
          from a brain injury or, or a lesion
          in there. My mom said I was born
          this way. Born laughing.


                            SOPHIE
                  Is that why she calls you Happy?

                            JOKER
                  Kind of. That actually started when
                  I was a kid. The other kids made
                  fun of me, called me Happy-- but
                  not in a good way. I got so sick of
                  it, one day when I was about ten,
                  I, I,--

                              SOPHIE
                  What?

                            JOKER
                  I took a razor and cut this smile
                  onto my face.
                  Sort of like "You want happy? Here,
                  how's this for happy?"


                              SOPHIE
                  You okay?

                            JOKER
                  I've been thinking about this night

               Is, is that my letter? Is that my

               How could you not tell me, Ma?

                         MOM
               You told me you dropped it off.
               You have no right opening my mail.
               Who do you think you are?

          How could you keep that from me?

          can Thomas Wayne be my father?

                     MOM (OS)

          He is an extraordinary man, Arthur.
          We had a connection. I was so
          beautiful then. We were in love.

                     MOM (OS)
          His wife could see it. She was
          jealous from the moment I started
          working there. She fired me before
          I even knew I was pregnant with
          you.
               And, I never told him or anybody
               because, well, you can imagine what
               people would say about Thomas and
               me, and, and what they would say
               about you.

               That I was a whore, and Thomas
               Wayne was a fornicator, and that
               you're a little, unwanted bastard.

          No, I heard he pulled it out and
          waved it around like a cowboy.

          It was a prop gun. And I didn't
          pull it out, it fell out.

                         MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
               So I told my youngest son, Tommy,
               remember he's the 'not so bright'
               one,--
               I told him that the garbage strike
               is still going on. And he says, and
               I'm not kidding, Tommy says, "So
               where are we gonna get all our
               garbage from?"

   
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
               And finally, in a world where
               everyone thinks they could do my
               job, we got this videotape from the
               Gotham Comedy Club. Here's a guy
               who thinks if you just keep
               laughing, it'll somehow make you
               funny. Check out this joker.

          -- good evening, hello.
          Good to be here.
          I, I hated school as a kid. But my
          mother would always say,--
          "You should enjoy it. One day
          you'll have to work for a living."
          "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
          comedian!"

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
          You should have listened to your
          mother.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
          One more, Bernie. Let's see one
          more. I love this guy.


                     JOKER (ON TV)
          It's funny, when I was a little boy
          and told people I wanted to be a
          comedian, everyone laughed at me.
          Well no one is laughing now.


                         MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
               You can say that again, pal!

    
                         YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
               -- I'm sorry to bother you, but can
               you settle an argument for us?
                            JOKER
               Excuse me?

                         YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
               You were the guy on Murray Franklin
               last night, right?


                         JOKER
               No, sorry. Wasn't me.

                         NURSE #1 (OS)
               Of course it was you. You were the
               comedian.

                         YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
               Except you weren't funny. You
               didn't tell any jokes.


                         JOKER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about.

                         YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
               No. It was definitely you, buddy.
               You're the guy who couldn't stop
               laughing. Murray killed you.


                         JOKER
               If I were you, I'd walk away from
               this table before I strangle all
               three of you with that fucking
               stethoscope hanging from your neck.

               Can I help you, pal?

                         JOKER
               What? Yeah. No I, I--


                     THOMAS WAYNE
          You need to get in here or
          something?


                    JOKER
          Dad. It's me.

                       THOMAS WAYNE
          Excuse me?

                     JOKER
          My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.
          I know you didn't know about me,
          and I don't want anything from you.
          Well... maybe a hug.

                    THOMAS WAYNE
          Jesus? You're the guy who came by
          my house yesterday.


                    JOKER
          Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,
          wouldn't let me see you. So I came
          here. I have so many questions.

                    THOMAS WAYNE
          Look pal, I'm not your father.
          What's wrong with you?

                    JOKER
          How do you know?


                    THOMAS WAYNE
          Cause you were adopted. And I never
          fucked your mother. What do you
          want from me, money?

                    JOKER
          No. What? I wasn't adopted.

                    THOMAS WAYNE
          She never told you? Your mother
          adopted you before she even started
          working for us. She was arrested
          when you were four years old and
          committed to Arkham State Hospital.
          She's batshit crazy.

                    JOKER
          No. No, I don't believe that.

                    THOMAS WAYNE
          I don't really give a shit   what you
          believe.
          But if you ever come to my   house
          again, if you ever talk to   my son
          again, if I ever even hear   about
          you again, I'll--


                    THOMAS WAYNE
          Are you laughing at me?

Joker's laughing so hard he can't answer.

                    THOMAS WAYNE
          You think this is funny?

                         JOKER
               No, no I have a con--

                         THOMAS WAYNE
               Is this a fucking joke to you?

   

                    CLERK
          Sorry for the wait. All our records
          that are 10 years or older are
          stored in the basement. You're
          talking over 30 years ago,-- I had                     
          to do some serious digging.


                    CLERK
          Like I said, if it's in here, I'm
          still gonna need a release from
          her.


                    JOKER
          Can I ask you a question? How does
          someone wind up in here? Have all
          these people committed crimes?

                    CLERK
          Some have. Some are just crazy and
          pose a danger to themselves or
          others. Some just got nowhere else
          to go.


                    JOKER
          Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes
          I don't know what to do, y'know, I
          don't think I can take any more of
          this.

                    CLERK
          Yeah, I can't take much more of
          this shit either.         
          Now they talking about more
          layoffs, man, we're understaffed as
          it is. I don't know what I'm gonna
          do.

                    JOKER
          Last time I ended up taking it out
          on some,-- people. Bad shit. I
          thought it would bother me but, it
          really hasn't.

                    CLERK
          What's that?

                    JOKER
          It's just so hard to try and be
          happy all the time, y'know, when
          everything's going to shit all
          around you.

                    CLERK
          Listen, I'm just an administrative
          assistant, like a clerk. I file
          paperwork, fill out forms. I don't
          really know what to tell you, but
          maybe you should see someone-- they
          have programs, like city services.

                    JOKER
          Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was
          just talking to talk.

                    CLERK
          Here it is,-- Fleck. Penny Fleck.

                    JOKER
          So she was a patient here.


                    CLERK
          Uh-huh. Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin

          You said she's your mother?


                    CLERK
          I'm sorry, I can't. Like I said, I
          can't release this without the
          proper forms. I could get in
          trouble.
          Besides, it's pretty bad.

                    JOKER
          I can handle bad. I've been on a
          pretty bad run myself.


                    CLERK
          I can't help you. If you want these

          Hi Arthur. Well, as I was saying--                     
          we've gotten a lot of calls about                      
          your clip, amazing responses. And,                     
          Murray asked if I would reach out                      
          to see if you would come on as his                     
          guest. Can we set up a day?

          Yes. Isn't that great? He'd love to                    
          talk to you, maybe do some of your

               Ma, remember how you used to tell
               me that God gave me this laugh for
               a reason. That I had a purpose. To
               bring laughter and joy into this
               fucked up world,--

               could you let that happen? What
               kind of woman are you? What kind of
               mother are you?

          show.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          So what's with the face? Are you
          part of the protests?

                    JOKER
          No, I don't believe in any of that.
          I don't believe in anything. I just
          thought it would be good for my
          act.

          Your act? Didn't you hear that a                       
          kid got killed on the subway and                       
          two cops who were almost beat to                       
          death? You didn't hear about the                       
          dozens of protestors and police                        
          injured in the riots?                                  

                    JOKER
          No. I hadn't heard.


                    GENE UFLAND
          --the audience is gonna go crazy if
          you put him on. It was okay maybe
          for a bit, but not a whole segment.
                     MURRAY FRANKLIN
          I like it. It's timely. It's edgy.
          It's, it's dangerous. The best
          comedy is all those things put
          together.
          We're gonna go with it.
                    JOKER
          Thank you Murray.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          Couple rules though,-- No cussing,
          no off-color material, we do a
          clean show, okay? You'll be on
          after Dr. Sally. Someone will come
          and get you. Good?

                    JOKER
          Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When
          you bring me out, can you introduce
          me as "The Joker"?


                     GENE UFLAND
          What? You don't want to use your
          real name?

                    JOKER
          Honestly, I don't even know what my
          real name is.


                    JOKER
          Besides, that's what you called me
          on the show, Murray. A joker.
          Remember?


                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Did I?

                          GENE UFLAND
                I have no idea.

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it
                is.

  
                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                You gotta see our next guest for
                yourself. Will you stick around?
                Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure
                he could use a doctor.


                          DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
                Oh. Does he have sexual problems?

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                He looks like he's got a lot of
                problems.


                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                It's been a crazy few days here in
                Gotham, and, I think maybe things
                are about to get crazy around here
                too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll
                be right back.

                          ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
                Back in 30 seconds.

                          DIRECTOR
                Okay, cue the clip. We'll come to
                it straight out of break.

                          ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
                Five... Four... Three...

                          DIRECTOR
                Roll clip. Put up the show graphic.

      

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                O-kay, you may have seen that clip
                of our next guest when we first
                played it two weeks ago. Now before
                he comes out, I just want to say
                that we're all heartbroken here and
                sensitive to what's going on in the
                city tonight. But, this is how he
                wanted to come on the show. So let
                me introduce-- The Joker.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the
          show. But I gotta tell ya, with
          what happened at City Hall today,
          I'm sure many of our viewers here
          in the studio, and at home, might
          find this look of yours in poor
          taste.

                           MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Can you tell us why you're dressed
                like this?

    

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Okay. But I'm not sure how any of
                this is funny. A lot of those
                protesters are going with this
                look. City seems to be full of
                clowns these days.

                          JOKER
                Yeah. Isn't it great?
                          TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
                This guy's got nothing.

                           DIRECTOR
                Gene, what the hell? You wanna kill
                this?

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                So when we talked earlier, you
                mentioned that you aren't
                political. That this look isn't a
                political statement.
                                                          106.


                    JOKER
          That's right. I'm not political,
          Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying
          to make people laugh.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          How's that goin' for ya? Have you
          been working on any new material?
          Do you want to tell us a joke?

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          You brought a joke book?


                    JOKER
          Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          Oh god, a knock-knock joke? And you
          need to read it?

                    JOKER
          I want to get it right. Knock
          knock.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          Who's there?

                     JOKER
          It's the police, ma'am. Your son
          has been hit by a drunk driver.
          He's dead.


                          DIRECTOR
                Okay, ready Camera Two. Take Two.
                Ready Three. Three.
   
                          MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON MONITORS)
                So, Arthur, you told me backstage
                that your--

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Right. Sorry. I mean Joker-- you
                told me backstage that your
                mother's a big fan of the show,
                that she never misses it.

                          JOKER
                That's right, Murray. But she's
                dead now.

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Hold on. Your mother's dead?

                          JOKER
                Yeah. She is.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          Okay. What about your father? Does
          he watch the show?


                     JOKER
          I don't know who my father is,
          Murray. Turns out I was adopted and
          sexually assaulted by my mother's
          boyfriend.

                    DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
          Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke
          about that.

                     MURRAY FRANKLIN
          Yeah, that's not funny, that's not
          the kind of humor we do on this
          show.

                     JOKER
          Sorry. It's been a rough few
          months, Murray. I mean, after my
          mother died, the police came to
          question me at her funeral. Who
          does that?

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          Oh really? Were you a suspect?

                    JOKER
          Very funny, Murray. No, they came
          because I killed those three Wall
          Street guys.


                           MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Okay. I'm waiting for the
                punchline.

                          JOKER
                There is no punchline. It's not a
                joke.

                          DIRECTOR
                Did he just confess to killing the
                Wall Street Three?

                          TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
                Yeah. I think he did.

                           ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
                He definitely did.

                          DIRECTOR
                Jesus Christ.
                Camera Three, get in close.


                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                You're serious, aren't you? You're
                telling us you killed those three
                boys on the subway. Why should we
                believe you?


                          JOKER
                I got nothing left to lose, Murray.
                Nothing can hurt me anymore. This
                is my fate, it was always my fate.
                My life is nothing but a comedy.            

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
                Let me get this straight, you think
                killing those young men is funny?

                          JOKER (ON TV)
                Yeah. But comedy is subjective,
                isn't that what they say? Besides,
                the way I see it, what happened was
                a good thing. All of you, Gotham,
                the system that knows so much, you
                decide, you decide what's right and
                wrong. What's real or what's made
                up. The same way you decide what's
                funny or not.

                           MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Okay, I think I understand. You did
                it to start a movement, to become a
                symbol.

                          JOKER
                C'mon, Murray, do I look like the
                kind of clown who could start a
                movement? I killed those guys                          
                because they were awful.                               
                Everybody's awful these days. It's
                enough to make anyone crazy.                           
                                                

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          So that's it, you're crazy. That's
          your defense for killing three
          young men? Because they were mean              
          to you?                                        

                    JOKER
          No. They couldn't carry a tune to              
          save their lives.                              
              

                    JOKER                                
          Why is everyone so upset about                 
          these guys? Because Thomas Wayne               
          went and cried about them on TV?

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN                      
          You have a problem with Thomas
          Wayne, too?

                    JOKER
          Yeah. I do. Everything comes so
          easy for him.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
          And what's wrong with that?

                    JOKER
          Have you seen what it's like out
          there, Murray? Do you ever actually            
          leave the studio? Everybody just               
          yells and screams at each other.               
          Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody
          thinks what it's like to be the
          other guy. You think men like                  
          Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever
          think what it's like to be a guy
          like me? To be anybody but
          themselves.
          They don't. They think we'll all
          just sit there and take it like
          good little boys. That we won't
          werewolf and go wild. Well, this is            
          for all of you out there.

                          POLICE LIEUTENANT (OS)
                That asshole just confessed to
                killing those Wall Street guys on
                fucking live TV!

   
                          MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
                So much self-pity, Arthur. You
                sound like you're making excuses
                for killing three young men. Not
                everybody's awful.                                      


                          JOKER
                You're awful, Murray.

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                Me? How am I awful?

                          JOKER
                Playing my video, inviting me on

                fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh

                of them, Murray. Everything comes
                too easy for you.

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                You don't know the first thing
                about me, pal. Look what happened
                because of what you did, Arthur,
                what it led to. There are riots out
                there. Two policemen are in                             
                critical condition, someone was                         
                killed today.

                How about another joke, Murray?
