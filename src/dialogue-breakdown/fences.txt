	BONO (v.o.)
	Troy, you ought to stop that lying!
	TROY (v.o.)
	I ain’t lying! The nigger had a watermelon this big. Talking about... “What watermelon, Mr. Rand?” I like to fell out! “What
	watermelon, Mr. Rand?”... And it sitting there
	big as life.
	BONO (v.o.)
	What did Mr. Rand say?
	TROY (v.o.) 
	Ain’t said nothing. Figure if the nigger
	too dumb to know he carrying a watermelon, he
	wasn’t gonna get much sense out of him. Trying to
	hide that great big old watermelon under his
	coat. Afraid to let the white man see him carry
	it home.
	BONO 
	I’m like you... I ain’t got no time for them
	kind of people.
	TROY
	Now what he look like getting mad ’cause he see
	the man from the union talking to Mr. Rand?
	BONO 
	He come talking to me about... “Troy Maxson
	gonna get us fired.” I told him to get away from
	me with that. He walked away from me calling you
	a troublemaker. What Mr. Rand say?
	TROY 
	Ain’t said nothing. He told me to go down to the
	commissioner’s office next Friday. They called me
	down there to see them.
	BONO
	Well, as long as you got your complaint filed,
	they can’t fire you. That’s what one of them white
	fellows tell me.
	TROY 
	I ain’t worried about them firing me. They gonna
	fire me ’cause I asked a question? That’s all I
	did. I went to Mr. Rand and asked him—“Why? Why
	you got the white mens driving and the colored
	lifting?” Told him, “What’s the matter, don’t I
	count?”
	TROY 
	You think only white fellows got sense enough
	to drive a truck? That ain’t no paper job. Hell,
	anybody can drive a truck. How come you got all
	the whites driving and the coloreds lifting?
	TROY 
	He told me, “Take it to the union.” Well, hell,
	that’s what I done! Now they wanna come up with
	this pack of lies.
	BONO 
	I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any
	questions... just tell the truth! It ain’t
	nothing but something they done trumped up on you
	’cause you filed a complaint on them.
	TROY 
	Brownie don’t understand nothing. All I want
	them to do is change the job description. Give
	everybody a chance to drive the truck. Brownie
	can’t see that. He ain’t got that much sense.
	How you figure he be making out with that gal be
	up at Taylors’ all the time... that Alberta
	gal?
	TROY
	Who?
	BONO 
	Brownie!
	TROY 
	Same as you and me. He getting as much as we is.
	Which is to say nothing.
	BONO 
	It is, huh? I figure you doing a little better
	than me... and I ain’t saying what I’m doing.
	TROY 
	Aw, nigger, look here... I know you. If you
	had got anywhere near that gal, twenty minutes
	later you be looking to tell somebody. And the
	first one you gonna tell... that you gonna want
	to brag to... is gonna be me.
	BONO 
	I ain’t saying that. I see where you be eyeing
	her.
	TROY
	I eye all the women. I don’t miss nothing. Don’t
	never let nobody tell you Troy Maxson don’t eye
	the women.
	BONO
	You been doing more than eyeing her. You done
	bought her a drink or two.
	TROY
	Hell yeah, I bought her a drink! What that mean?
	I bought you one, too. What that mean ’cause I buy
	her a drink? I’m just being polite.
	BONO
	It’s all right to buy her one drink. That’s what
	you call being polite. But when you wanna be buying two or three... that’s what you call eyeing her.
	TROY
	Look here, as long as you known me... you
	ever known me to chase after women?
	BONO 
	Hell yeah! Long as I done known you. You forgetting I knew you when.
	TROY 
	Naw, I’m talking about since I been married to
	Rose?
	BONO
	Oh, not since you been married to Rose. Now,
	that’s the truth, there. I can say that.
	TROY
	All right then! Case closed.
	BONO
	I see you be walking up around Alberta’s house.
	You supposed to be at Taylors’ and you be walking
	up around there.
	TROY 
	What you watching where I’m walking for? I ain’t
	watching after you.
	BONO 
	I seen you walking around there more than once.
	TROY 
	Hell, you liable to see me walking anywhere!
	That don’t mean nothing because you seen me walking around there.
	BONO 
	Where she come from anyway? She just kinda
	showed up one day.
	TROY 
	Tallahassee. You can look at her and tell she one
	of them Florida gals. They got some big healthy
	women down there. Grow them right up out the ground.
	Got a little bit of Indian in her. Most of them
	niggers down in Florida got some Indian in them.
	BONO 
	I don’t know about that Indian part. But she
	damn sure big and healthy. Woman wears some big
	stockings. Got them great big old legs and hips
	as wide as the Mississippi river.
	TROY 
	Legs don’t mean nothing. You don’t do nothing
	but push them out of the way. But them hips cushion the ride!
	BONO 
	Troy, you ain’t got no sense.
	TROY 
	It’s the truth! Like you riding on Goodyears!
	ROSE 
	What you all out here getting into?
	TROY 
	What you worried about what we getting into for?
	This is men talk, woman.
	ROSE 
	What I care what you talking about? Bono, you
	gonna stay for supper?
	BONO 
	No, I thank you, Rose. But Lucille say she cooking up a pot of pigfeet.
	TROY 
	Pigfeet! Hell, I’m going home with you! Might
	even stay the night if you got some pigfeet. You
	got something in there to top them pigfeet, Rose?
	ROSE 
	I’m cooking up some chicken. I got some chicken
	and collard greens.
	TROY 
	Well, go on back in the house and let me and
	Bono finish what we was talking about. This is men
	talk. I got some talk for you later. You know what
	kind of talk I mean. Go on and powder it up.
	ROSE 
	Troy Maxson, don’t you start that now!
	TROY 
	Aw, woman... come here.
	Look here, Bono... When I met this woman...
	I got out that place, say, “Hitch up my pony,
	saddle up my mare... there’s a woman out there
	for me somewhere. I looked here. Looked there.
	Saw Rose and latched on to her.” I latched on to
	her and told her—I’m gonna tell you the truth—I
	told her, “Baby, I don’t wanna marry, I just
	wanna be your man.” Rose told me... tell him
	what you told me, Rose.
	ROSE 
	I told him if he wasn’t the marrying kind, then
	move out the way so the marrying kind could find me.
	TROY 
	That’s what she told me. “Nigger, you in my way.
	You blocking the view! Move out the way so I can
	find me a husband.” I thought it over two or three
	days. Come back—
	ROSE 
	Ain’t no two or three days nothing. You was back
	the same night.
	TROY 
	Come back, told her... “Okay, baby... but
	I’m gonna buy me a banty rooster and put him out
	there in the backyard... and when he see a
	stranger come, he’ll flap his wings and crow...”
	Look here, Bono, I could watch the front door by
	myself... it was that back door I was worried
	about.
	ROSE 
	Troy, you ought not talk like that. Troy ain’t
	doing nothing but telling a lie.
	TROY 
	Only thing is... when we first got married... forget the rooster... we ain’t had
	no yard!
	BONO 
	I hear you tell it. Me and Lucille was staying
	down there on Logan Street. Had two rooms with the
	outhouse in the back. I ain’t mind the outhouse
	none. But when that goddamn wind blow through
	there in the winter... that’s what I’m talking
	about! To this day I wonder why in the hell I ever
	stayed down there for six long years. But see, I
	didn’t know I could do no better. I thought only
	white folks had inside toilets and things.
	ROSE 
	There’s a lot of people don’t know they can do
	no better than they doing now. That’s just something you got to learn. A lot of folks still shop
	at Bella’s.
	TROY 
	Ain’t nothing wrong with shopping at Bella’s.
	She got fresh food.
	ROSE 
	I ain’t said nothing about if she got fresh
	food. I’m talking about what she charge. She
	charge ten cents more than the A&P.
	TROY 
	The A&P ain’t never done nothing for me. I
	spends my money where I’m treated right. I go
	down to Bella, say, “I need a loaf of bread, I’ll
	pay you Friday.” She give it to me. What sense
	that make when I got money to go and spend it
	somewhere else and ignore the person who done
	right by me? That ain’t in the Bible.
	ROSE 
	We ain’t talking about what’s in the Bible. What
	sense it make to shop there when she overcharge?
	TROY 
	You shop where you want to. I’ll do my shopping
	where the people been good to me.
	ROSE 
	Well, I don’t think it’s right for her to overcharge. That’s all I was saying.
	BONO 
	Look here... I got to get on. Lucille be
	raising all kind of hell.
	TROY 
	Where you going, nigger? We ain’t finished this
	pint. Come here, finish this pint.
	BONO 
	Well, hell, I am... if you ever turn the bottle loose.
	TROY 
	The only thing I say about the A&P is I’m glad
	Cory got that job down there. Help him take care
	of his school clothes and things.
	TROY 
	Gabe done moved out and things getting tight
	around here. He got that job... he can start
	to look out for himself.
	ROSE 
	Cory done went and got recruited by a college
	football team.
	TROY 
	I told that boy about that football stuff. The
	white man ain’t gonna let him get nowhere with
	that football. I told him when he first come to me
	with it. Now you come telling me he done went and
	got more tied up in it. He ought to go and get
	recruited in how to fix cars or something where he
	can make a living.
	ROSE 
	He ain’t talking about making no living playing
	football. It’s just something the boys in school
	do. They gonna send a recruiter by to talk to you.
	He’ll tell you he ain’t talking about making no
	living playing football. It’s a honor to be recruited.
	TROY 
	It ain’t gonna get him nowhere. Bono’ll tell you
	that.
	BONO 
	If he be like you in the sports... he’s gonna
	be all right. Ain’t but two men ever played base
	ball as good as you. That’s Babe Ruth and Josh
	Gibson. Them’s the only two men ever hit more
	home runs than you.
	TROY 
	What it ever get me? Ain’t got a pot to piss in
	or a window to throw it out of.
	ROSE 
	Times have changed since you was playing baseball, Troy. That was before the war. Times have
	changed a lot since then.
	TROY 
	How in hell they done changed?
	ROSE 
	They got lots of colored boys playing ball now.
	Baseball and football.
	BONO 
	You right about that, Rose. Times have changed,
	Troy. You just come along too early.
	TROY 
	There ought not never have been no time called
	too early! Now you take that fellow... what’s
	that fellow they had playing right field for the
	Yankees back then? You know who I’m talking about,
	Bono. Used to play right field for the Yankees.
	ROSE 
	Selkirk?
	TROY 
	Selkirk! That’s it! Man batting .269, understand? .269. What kind of sense that make? I was
	hitting .432 with thirty-seven home runs! Man
	batting .269 and playing right field for the Yankees! I saw Josh Gibson’s daughter yesterday. She
	walking around with raggedy shoes on her feet.
	Now I bet you Selkirk’s daughter ain’t walking
	around with raggedy shoes on her feet! I bet you
	that!
	ROSE 
	They got a lot of colored baseball players now.
	Jackie Robinson was the first. Folks had to wait
	for Jackie Robinson.
	TROY 
	I done seen a hundred niggers play baseball better than Jackie Robinson. Hell, I know some teams
	Jackie Robinson couldn’t even make! What you
	talking about Jackie Robinson. Jackie Robinson
	wasn’t nobody. I’m talking about if you could
	play ball then they ought to have let you play.
	Don’t care what color you were. Come telling me I
	come along too early. If you could play...
	then they ought to have let you play.
	ROSE 
	You gonna drink yourself to death. You don’t
	need to be drinking like that.
	TROY 
	Death ain’t nothing. I done seen him. Done
	wrassled with him. You can’t tell me nothing
	about death. Death ain’t nothing but a fastball
	on the outside corner. And you know what I’ll do
	to that! Lookee here, Bono... am I lying?
	TROY 
	You get one of them fastballs, about waist high,
	over the outside corner of the plate where you
	can get the meat of the bat on it...
	TROY 
	You can kiss it good-bye. Now, am I lying?
	BONO 
	Naw, you telling the truth there. I seen you do
	it.
	TROY 
	If I’m lying... that 450 feet worth of lying!
	That’s all death is to me. A fastball on the outside corner.
	ROSE 
	I don’t know why you want to get on talking
	about death.
	TROY 
	Ain’t nothing wrong with talking about death.
	That’s part of life. Everybody gonna die. You
	gonna die, I’m gonna die. Bono’s gonna die. Hell,
	we all gonna die.
	ROSE 
	But you ain’t got to talk about it. I don’t like
	to talk about it.
	TROY 
	You the one brought it up. Me and Bono was
	talking about baseball... you tell me I’m
	gonna drink myself to death. Ain’t that right,
	Bono? You know I don’t drink this but one night
	out of the week. That’s Friday night. I’m gonna
	drink just enough to where I can handle it. Then
	I cuts it loose. I leave it alone. So don’t you
	worry about me drinking myself to death. ’Cause I
	ain’t worried about Death. I done seen him. I
	done wrestled with him.
	TROY 
	Look here, Bono... I looked up one day and
	Death was marching straight at me. Like Soldiers
	on Parade! The Army of Death was marching straight
	at me. The middle of July, 1941. It got real cold
	just like it be winter. It seem like Death himself reached out and touched me on the shoulder.
	He touch me just like I touch you. I got cold as
	ice and Death standing there grinning at me.
	ROSE 
	Troy, why don’t you hush that talk.
	TROY 
	I say... “What you want, Mr. Death? You be
	wanting me? You done brought your army to be getting me?” I looked him dead in the eye. I wasn’t
	fearing nothing. I was ready to tangle. Just like
	I’m ready to tangle now. The bible say be ever
	vigilant. That’s why I don’t get but so drunk. I
	got to keep watch.
	ROSE
	Troy was right down there in Mercy Hospital. You remember he had pneumonia? Laying
	there with a fever talking plumb out of his head.
	TROY 
	Death standing there staring at me... carrying
	that sickle in his hand. Finally he say, “You want
	bound over for another year?” See, just like
	that... “You want bound over for another year?”
	I told him, “Bound over hell! Let’s settle this
	now!” It seem like he kinda fell back when I said
	that, and all the cold went out of me. I reached
	down and grabbed that sickle and threw it just as
	far as I could throw it... and me and him commenced to wrestling. We wrestled for three days and
	three nights. I can’t say where I found the strength
	from. Every time it seemed like he was gonna get
	the best of me, I’d reach way down deep inside myself and find the strength to do him one better.
	ROSE 
	Every time Troy tell that story he find different
	ways to tell it. Different things to make up
	about it.
	TROY 
	I ain’t making up nothing. I’m telling you the
	facts of what happened. I wrestled with Death for
	three days and three nights and I’m standing here
	to tell you about it... All right. At the end
	of the third night we done weakened each other to
	where we can’t hardly move. Death stood up,
	throwed on his robe... had him a white robe
	with a hood on it.
	Troy mimics a Klansman’s hood. Bono laughs at
	this; Rose does the same in spite of herself.
	TROY 
	He throwed on that robe and went off to look for
	his sickle. Say, “I’ll be back.” Just like that.
	“I’ll be back.” I told him say, “Yeah, but...
	you gonna have to find me!” I wasn’t no fool. I
	wasn’t going looking for him. Death ain’t nothing
	to play with.
	TROY 
	And I know he’s gonna get me. I know I
	got to join his army... his camp followers.
	But as long as I keep my strength and see him
	coming... as long as I keep up my vigilance... he’s gonna have to fight to get me. I
	ain’t going easy.
	BONO 
	Well, look here, since you got to keep up your
	vigilance... let me have the bottle.
	TROY 
	Aw hell, I shouldn’t have told you that part. I
	should have left out that part.
	ROSE 
	Troy be talking that stuff and half the time
	don’t even know what he be talking about.
	TROY 
	Bono know me better than that.
	BONO 
	That’s right. I know you. I know you got some
	Uncle Remus in your blood. You got more stories
	than the devil got sinners.
	TROY 
	Aw hell, I done seen him too! Done talked with
	the devil.
	ROSE 
	Troy, don’t nobody want to be hearing all that
	stuff.
	LYONS 
	Hey, Pop.
	TROY 
	What you come “Hey, Popping” me for?
	LYONS 
	How you doing, Rose?
	LYONS 
	Mr. Bono. How you doing?
	BONO 
	Hey, Lyons... how you been?
	TROY 
	He must have been doing all right. I ain’t seen
	him around here last week.
	ROSE 
	Troy, leave your boy alone. He come by to see
	you and you wanna start all that nonsense.
	TROY 
	I ain’t bothering Lyons.
	TROY 
	Here... get you a drink. We got an understanding. I know why he come by to see me and he
	know I know.
	LYONS 
	Come on, Pop... I just stopped by to say
	hi... see how you was doing.
	TROY 
	You ain’t stopped by yesterday.
	ROSE 
	You gonna stay for supper, Lyons? I got some
	chicken cooking in the oven.
	As she heads toward the house, Rose
	picks up Troy’s apron and gloves from
	the back porch, carrying them inside.
	LYONS 
	No, Rose... thanks. I was just in the neighborhood and thought I’d stop by for a minute.
	TROY 
	You was in the neighborhood all right, nigger.
	You telling the truth there. You was in the neighborhood ’cause it’s my payday.
	LYONS 
	Well, hell, since you mentioned it... let me
	have ten dollars.
	TROY 
	I’ll be damned! I’ll die and go to hell and play
	blackjack with the devil before I give you ten
	dollars.
	BONO 
	That’s what I want to know about... that
	devil you done seen.
	LYONS 
	Pop done seen the devil? You too much Pops.
	TROY 
	Yeah, I done seen him. Talked to him too!
	ROSE 
	You ain’t seen no devil. I done told you that
	man ain’t had nothing to do with the devil. Anything you can’t understand, you want to call it
	the devil.
	TROY 
	Look here, Bono... I went down to see Hertzberger about some furniture. Got three rooms for
	two- ninety-eight. That what it say on the radio.
	“Three rooms... two- ninety-eight.” Even made
	up a little song about it. Go down there... man
	tell me I can’t get no credit. I’m working every
	day and can’t get no credit. What to do? I got an
	empty house with some raggedy furniture in it.
	Cory ain’t got no bed. He’s sleeping on a pile of
	rags on the floor. Working every day and can’t get
	no credit. Come back here—Rose’ll tell you—madder
	than hell. Sit down... try to figure what I’m
	gonna do. Come a knock on the door. Ain’t been
	living here but three days. Who know I’m here?
	Open the door... devil standing there bigger
	than life. White fellow... got on good clothes
	and everything. Standing there with a clipboard in
	his hand. I ain’t had to say nothing. First words
	come out of his mouth was... “I understand you
	need some furniture and can’t get no credit.” I
	liked to fell over. He say, “I’ll give you all the
	credit you want, but you got to pay the interest
	on it.” I told him, “Give me three rooms’ worth
	and charge whatever you want.” Next day a truck
	pulled up here and two men unloaded them three
	rooms. Man what drove the truck give me a book.
	Say send ten dollars, first of every month to the
	address in the book and everything will be all
	right. Say if I miss a payment the devil was coming back and it’ll be hell to pay. That was fifteen
	years ago. To this day... the first of the month
	I send my ten dollars, Rose’ll tell you.
	ROSE 
	Troy lying.
	TROY 
	I ain’t never seen that man since. Now you tell
	me who else that could have been but the devil? I
	ain’t sold my soul or nothing like that, you understand. Naw, I wouldn’t have truck with the
	devil about nothing like that.
	TROY 
	I got my furniture and pays my ten dollars the
	first of the month just like clockwork.
	BONO 
	How long you say you been paying this ten dollars a month?
	TROY 
	Fifteen years!
	BONO 
	Hell, ain’t you finished paying for it yet? How
	much the man done charged you?
	TROY 
	Aw hell, I done paid for it. I done paid for it
	ten times over! The fact is I’m scared to stop
	paying it.
	ROSE 
	Troy lying. We got that furniture from Mr.
	Glickman. He ain’t paying no ten dollars a month
	to nobody.
	TROY 
	Aw hell, woman. Bono know I ain’t that big a
	fool.
	LYONS 
	I was just getting ready to say... I know
	where there’s a bridge for sale.
	TROY 
	Look here, I’ll tell you this... it don’t matter to me if he was the devil. It don’t matter if
	the devil give credit. Somebody has got to give it.
	ROSE 
	It ought to matter. You going around talking
	about having truck with the devil... God’s the
	one you gonna have to answer to. He’s the one
	gonna be at the Judgment.
	LYONS 
	Yeah, well, look here, Pop... let me have
	that ten dollars. I’ll give it back to you. Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.
	TROY 
	What I tell you, Bono? The only time I see this
	nigger is when he wants something. That’s the
	only time I see him.
	LYONS 
	Come on, Pop, Mr. Bono don’t want to hear all
	that. Let me have the ten dollars. I told you
	Bonnie working.
	TROY 
	What that mean to me? “Bonnie working.” I don’t
	care if she working. Go ask her for the ten dollars if she working. Talking about “Bonnie working.” Why ain’t you working?
	LYONS 
	Aw, Pop, you know I can’t find no decent job.
	Where am I gonna get a job at? You know I can’t
	get no job.
	TROY 
	I told you I know some people down there. I can
	get you on the rubbish if you want to work. I told
	you that the last time you came by here asking me
	for something.
	LYONS 
	Naw, Pop... thanks. That ain’t for me. I
	don’t wanna be carrying nobody’s rubbish. I don’t
	want to be punching nobody’s time clock
	TROY 
	What’s the matter, you too good to carry people’s rubbish? Where you think that ten dollars
	you talking about come from? I’m just supposed to
	haul people’s rubbish and give my money to you
	’cause you too lazy to work. You too lazy to work
	and wanna know why you ain’t got what I got.
	ROSE 
	What hospital Bonnie working at? Mercy?
	LYONS 
	She’s down at Passavant working in the laundry.
	TROY 
	I ain’t got nothing as it is. I give you that ten
	dollars and I got to eat beans the rest of the week.
	Naw... you ain’t getting no ten dollars here.
	LYONS 
	You ain’t got to be eating no beans. I don’t
	know why you wanna say that.
	TROY 
	I ain’t got no extra money. Gabe done moved over
	to Miss Pearl’s, paying her the rent, and things
	done got tight around here. I can’t afford to be
	giving you every payday.
	LYONS 
	I ain’t asked you to give me nothing. I asked
	you to loan me ten dollars. I know you got ten
	dollars.
	TROY
	Yeah, I got it. You know why I got it?
	’Cause I don’t throw my money away out there in
	the streets. You living the fast life... wanna
	be a musician... running around in them clubs
	and things... then, you learn to take care of
	yourself. You ain’t gonna find me going and asking
	nobody for nothing. I done spent too many years
	without.
	LYONS 
	You and me is two different people, Pop.
	TROY 
	I done learned my mistake and learned to do
	what’s right by it. You still trying to get something for nothing. Life don’t owe you nothing.
	You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono. He’ll tell you
	I’m right.
	LYONS 
	You got your way of dealing with the world...
	I got mine. The only thing that matters to me is
	the music.
	TROY 
	Yeah, I can see that! It don’t matter how you
	gonna eat... where your next dollar is coming
	from. You telling the truth there.
	LYONS
	I know I got to eat. But I got to live
	too. I need something that gonna help me to get
	out of the bed in the morning. Make me feel like
	I belong in the world. I don’t bother nobody. I
	just stay with my music ’cause that’s the only
	way I can find to live in the world. Otherwise
	there ain’t no telling what I might do. Now I
	don’t come criticizing you and how you live. I
	just come by to ask you for ten dollars... I
	don’t wanna hear all that about how I live!
	TROY 
	Boy, your mama did a hell of a job raising you.
	LYONS 
	You can’t change me, Pop. I’m thirty-four years
	old. If you wanted to change me, you should have
	been there when I was growing up. I come by to see
	you... ask for ten dollars and you want to
	talk about how I was raised. You don’t know nothing about how I was raised.
	ROSE 
	Let the boy have ten dollars, Troy.
	TROY
	 What the hell you looking at me for?
	I ain’t got no ten dollars. You know what I do
	with my money.
	Give him ten dollars if you want him to have it.
	ROSE 
	I will. Just as soon as you turn it loose.
	TROY
	There it is. Seventy-six
	dollars and forty-two cents. You see this, Bono?
	Now, I ain’t gonna get but six of that back.
	ROSE 
	You ought to stop telling that lie. Here, Lyons.
	She hands him the money.
	LYONS
	Thanks, Rose. Look... I
	got to run... I’ll see you later.
	TROY 
	Wait a minute. You gonna say, “thanks, Rose,”
	and ain’t gonna look to see where she got that ten
	dollars from? See how they do me, Bono?
	LYONS 
	I know she got it from you, Pop. Thanks. I’ll
	give it back to you.
	TROY 
	There he go telling another lie. Time I see that
	ten dollars... he’ll be owing me thirty more.
	LYONS 
	See you, Mr. Bono.
	BONO 
	Take care, Lyons!
	LYONS 
	Thanks, Pop. I’ll see you again.
	TROY 
	I don’t know why he don’t go and get him a decent job and take care of that woman he got.
	BONO 
	He’ll be all right, Troy. The boy is still young.
	TROY 
	The boy is thirty-four years old.
	ROSE 
	Let’s not get off into all that.
	BONO 
	Look here... I got to be going. I got to be
	getting on. Lucille gonna be waiting.
	TROY 
	See this woman, Bono? I love this woman. I love
	this woman so much it hurts. I love her so
	much... I done run out of ways of loving her.
	So I got to go back to basics. Don’t you come by
	my house Monday morning talking about time to go
	to work... ’cause I’m still gonna be stroking!
	ROSE 
	Troy! Stop it now!
	BONO 
	I ain’t paying him no mind, Rose. That ain’t
	nothing but gin-talk. Go on, Troy. I’ll see you
	Monday.
	TROY 
	Don’t you come by my house, nigger!
	TROY
	I done told you what I’m gonna be doing.
	ROSE 
	...Just ask Jesus to be a fence around
	you,
	And you never have to worry anymore.
	Just bow down...
	Jesus be a fence all around me every day.
	ROSE
	When you get burdened—
	Jesus, I want you to protect me
	As I travel on the way.
	When you get lonely—
	ROSE 
	Jesus be a fence all around me every day
	Jesus, protect me
	As I travel on my way.
	ROSE 
	Morning. You ready for breakfast? I can fix it
	as soon I finish hanging up these clothes.
	TROY 
	I got the coffee on. That’ll be all right. I’ll
	just drink some of that this morning.
	ROSE
	That 651 hit yesterday. That’s
	the second time this month. Miss Pearl hit for a
	dollar... seem like those that need the least
	always get lucky. Poor folks can’t get nothing.
	TROY 
	Them numbers don’t know nobody. I don’t know why
	you fool with them. You and Lyons both.
	ROSE 
	It’s something to do.
	TROY 
	You ain’t doing nothing but throwing your money
	away.
	ROSE 
	Troy, you know I don’t play foolishly. I just
	play a nickel here and a nickel there.
	TROY 
	That’s two nickels you done thrown away.
	ROSE 
	Now I hit sometimes... that makes up for it.
	It always come in handy when I do hit. I don’t
	hear you complaining then.
	TROY 
	I ain’t complaining now. I just say it’s foolish.
	Trying to guess out of six hundred ways which way
	the number gonna come. If I had all the money niggers... these Negroes, throw away on numbers
	for one week—just one week—I’d be a rich man.
	ROSE
	Well, you wishing and calling it foolish ain’t gonna stop folks from playing numbers. That’s one thing for sure.
	Besides... some good things come from playing
	numbers. Look where Pope done bought him that
	restaurant off of numbers.
	TROY 
	I can’t stand niggers like that. Man ain’t had
	two dimes to rub together. He walking around with
	his shoes all run over bumming money for cigarettes. All right. Got lucky there and hit the
	numbers...
	ROSE 
	Troy, I know all about it.
	TROY 
	Had good sense, I’ll say that for him. He ain’t
	throwed his money away.
	TROY 
	I seen niggers hit the numbers and go through
	two thousand dollars in four days. Man brought
	him that restaurant down there... fixed it up
	real nice... and then didn’t want nobody to
	come in it! A Negro go in there and can’t get no
	kind of service. I seen a white fellow come in
	there and order a bowl of stew. Pope picked all
	the meat out the pot for him. Man ain’t had nothing but a bowl of meat! Negro come behind him and
	ain’t got nothing but the potatoes and carrots.
	Talking about what numbers do for people, you
	picked a wrong example. Ain’t done nothing but
	make a worser fool out of him than he was before.
	ROSE 
	Troy, you ought to stop worrying about what happened at work yesterday.
	TROY 
	I ain’t worried. Just told me to be down there
	at the commissioner’s office on Friday. Everybody
	think they gonna fire me. I ain’t worried about
	them firing me. You ain’t got to worry about that.
	Where’s Cory? Cory in the house?
	cory!
	ROSE 
	He gone out.
	TROY 
	Out, huh? He gone out ’cause he know I want him
	to help me with this fence. I know how he is. That
	boy scared of work. He ain’t done a lick of work
	in his life.
	ROSE 
	He had to go to football practice. Coach wanted
	them to get in a little extra practice before the
	season start.
	TROY 
	I got his practice... running out of here
	before he get his chores done.
	ROSE 
	Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?
	ROSE 
	Don’t nothing set right with you. Go on back in
	there and go to bed... get up on the other side.
	TROY 
	Why something got to be wrong with me? I ain’t
	said nothing wrong with me.
	ROSE 
	You got something to say about everything. First
	it’s the numbers... then it’s the way the man
	runs his restaurant... then you done got on
	Cory. What’s it gonna be next? Take a look up
	there and see if the weather suits you... or
	is it gonna be how you gonna put up the fence with
	the clothes hanging in the yard.
	TROY 
	You hit the nail on the head then.
	ROSE 
	I know you like I know the back of my hand. Come
	on in here and get you some more coffee... see
	if that straighten you up.
	’Cause you ain’t right this morning.
	Troy starts to pace out the fence
	GABRIEL
	Yes, ma’am, I got plums
	You ask me how I sell them
	Oh ten cents apiece—Three for a quarter
	Come and buy now...
	GABRIEL
	Cause I’m here today and tomorrow
	I’ll be gone.
	GABRIEL
	There’s Troy... Hey, Troy!
	TROY 
	Hey, Gabe.
	Rose comes out on the porch.
	GABRIEL
	Hey, Rose!
	ROSE 
	How you doing, Gabe?
	ROSE 
	What you got there?
	GABRIEL
	You know what I got, Rose. I got fruits and
	vegetables.
	ROSE 
	Where’s all these plums you talking about?
	GABRIEL
	I ain’t got no plums today, Rose. I was just
	singing that. Have some tomorrow. Put me in a big
	order for plums. Have enough plums tomorrow for
	Saint Peter and everybody.
	GABRIEL
	Troy’s mad at me.
	TROY 
	I ain’t mad at you. What I got to be mad at you
	about? You ain’t done nothing to me.
	GABRIEL
	I just moved over to Miss Pearl’s to keep
	out from in your way. I ain’t mean no harm by
	it.
	TROY 
	Who said anything about that? I ain’t said anything about that.
	GABRIEL
	You ain’t mad at me, is you?
	TROY 
	Naw... I ain’t mad at you, Gabe. If I was mad
	at you I’d tell you about it.
	GABRIEL 
	Got me two rooms. In the basement. Got my own
	door too. Wanna see my key?
	GABRIEL 
	That’s my own key! Ain’t nobody else got a key
	like that. That’s my key! My two rooms.
	TROY 
	Well, that’s good, Gabe. You got your own
	key... that’s good.
	ROSE 
	You hungry, Gabe? I was just fixing to cook Troy
	his breakfast.
	GABRIEL 
	I’ll take some biscuits. You got some biscuits?
	GABRIEL
	Did you know when I was in Heaven...
	every morning me and Saint Peter would sit down
	by the Gate and eat some big fat biscuits?
	GABRIEL 
	Oh, yeah! We had us a good time. We’d sit
	there and eat us them biscuits and then Saint Peter would go off to sleep and tell me to wake him
	up when it’s time to open the Gates for the Judgment.
	ROSE 
	Well, come on, I’ll make up a batch of biscuits.
	GABRIEL 
	Troy... Saint Peter got your name in the
	book. I seen it. It say... Troy Maxson. I
	say... I know him! He got the same name like
	what I got. That’s my brother!
	TROY 
	How many times you gonna tell me that, Gabe?
	GABRIEL 
	Ain’t got my name in the book. Don’t have to
	have my name. I done died and went to Heaven. He
	got your name though. One morning Saint Peter was
	looking at his book... marking it up for the
	Judgment... and he let me see your name. Got it
	in there under M. Got Rose’s name... I ain’t
	seen it like I seen yours... but I know it’s in
	there. He got a great big book. Got everybody’s
	name what was ever been born. That’s what he told
	me. But I seen your name. Seen it with my own eyes.
	TROY 
	Go on in the house there. Rose going to fix you
	something to eat.
	GABRIEL 
	Oh, I ain’t hungry. I done had breakfast with
	Aunt Jemimah. She come by and cooked me up a whole
	mess of flapjacks. Remember how we used to eat
	them flapjacks?
	TROY 
	Go on in the house and get you something to eat
	now.
	GABRIEL 
	I got to go sell my plums. I done sold some
	tomatoes. Got me two quarters. Wanna see?
	He shows his quarters to Troy, then
	pockets them.
	GABRIEL 
	I’m gonna save them and buy me a new horn so
	Saint Peter can hear me when it’s time to open the
	Gates.
	Hear that? Hear that? That’s the hellhounds. I
	got to chase them out of here. Go on get out of
	here! Get out!
	Well, all you hypocrite members,
	You wasting your time away.
	My God’s calling for workmens
	And you had better obey.
	Better get ready for judgment!
	Gabriel walks away singing as
	neighborhood kids give chase. Troy
	starts after him, then stops, looking
	at the old ladies, watching. He goes
	into the house.
	ROSE 
	Where’s Gabe?
	TROY 
	He gone off somewhere.
	ROSE 
	He ain’t eating right. Miss Pearl say she can’t
	get him to eat nothing.
	TROY 
	What you want me to do about it, Rose? I done
	did everything I can for the man. I can’t make him
	get well. Man got half his head blown away...
	what you expect?
	ROSE 
	Seem like something ought to be done to help him.
	TROY 
	Man don’t bother nobody. He just mixed up from
	that metal plate he got in his head. Ain’t no
	sense for him to go back into the hospital.
	ROSE 
	Least he be eating right. They can help him take
	care of himself.
	24249
	TROY 
	Don’t nobody wanna be locked up, Rose. What you
	wanna lock him up for? Man go over there and fight
	the war... messin’ around with them Japs, get
	half his head blown off... and they give him a
	lousy three thousand dollars. And I had to swoop
	down on that.
	ROSE 
	Is you fixing to go into that again?
	TROY 
	That’s the only way I got a roof over my
	head... ’cause of that metal plate.
	ROSE 
	Ain’t no sense you blaming yourself for nothing.
	Gabe wasn’t in no condition to manage that money.
	You done what was right by him. Can’t nobody say
	you ain’t done what was right by him. Look how
	long you took care of him... till he wanted to
	have his own place and moved over there with Miss
	Pearl.
	TROY 
	That ain’t what I’m saying, woman! I’m just
	stating the facts. If my brother didn’t have that
	metal plate in his head... I wouldn’t have a
	pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. And
	I’m fifty-three years old. Now see if you can understand that!
	ROSE 
	Where you going off to? You been running out of
	here every Saturday for weeks. I thought you was
	gonna work on this fence?
	TROY 
	I’m gonna walk down to Taylors’. Listen to the
	ball game. I’ll be back in a bit. I’ll work on it
	when I get back.
	CORY
	Mama? You all right?
	ROSE 
	Your daddy like to had a fit with you running out
	of here this morning without doing your chores.
	CORY 
	I told you I had to go to practice.
	ROSE 
	He say you were supposed to help him with the
	fence.
	CORY 
	He been saying that the last four or five Saturdays, and then he don’t never do nothing, but go
	down to Taylors’... Did you tell him about the
	recruiter?
	ROSE 
	Yeah, I told him.
	CORY 
	What he say?
	ROSE 
	He ain’t said nothing too much. You get up there
	and get started on your chores before he gets
	back. Go on and scrub down them steps before he
	gets back here hollering and carrying on.
	ROSE 
	Troy!
	ROSE 
	Go on, now. You liked to scared me to death.
	What was the score of the game? Lucille had me on
	the phone and I couldn’t keep up with it.
	TROY 
	What I care about the game? Come here, woman.
	ROSE 
	I thought you went down Taylors’ to listen to
	the game. Go on, Troy! You supposed to be putting
	up the fence.
	TROY 
	I’ll put it up when I finish with what is at
	hand.
	ROSE 
	Go on, Troy. I ain’t studying you.
	TROY 
	I’m studying you... fixing to do my homework!
	He lunges again, grabs her.
	ROSE 
	Troy, you better leave me alone.
	TROY 
	Where’s Cory? That boy brought his butt home yet?
	ROSE 
	He’s in the house doing his chores.
	TROY
	Cory!! Get your butt out here, boy!
	When you coming back?
	ROSE
	I’ll be right back.
	TROY 
	When?
	ROSE 
	I’m just going down the street.
	TROY 
	You just now coming in here from leaving this
	morning?
	CORY 
	Yeah, I had to go to football practice.
	TROY 
	Yeah, what?
	CORY 
	Yessir.
	TROY 
	I ain’t but two seconds off you noway. The garbage sitting in there overflowing... you ain’t
	done none of your chores... and you come in
	here talking about, “Yeah.”
	CORY 
	I was just getting ready to do my chores now,
	Pop...
	TROY 
	Your first chore is to help me with this fence
	on Saturday. Everything else come after that. Now
	get that saw and cut them boards.
	Cory takes the saw and begins cutting
	the boards. Troy continues working.
	There is a long pause.
	CORY 
	Hey, Pop... why don’t you buy a TV?
	TROY 
	What I want with a TV? What I want one of them
	for?
	CORY 
	Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra... Jesse!
	TROY 
	I ain’t asked you who had one. I say what I want
	with one?
	CORY 
	So you can watch it. They got lots of things on
	TV. Baseball games and everything. We could watch
	the World Series.
	TROY 
	Yeah ...And how much this TV cost?
	CORY 
	I don’t know. They got them on sale for around
	two hundred dollars.
	TROY 
	Two hundred dollars, huh?
	CORY 
	That ain’t that much, Pop.
	TROY 
	Naw, it’s just two hundred dollars.
	See that roof you got over your head at night?
	Let me tell you something about that roof. It’s
	been over ten years since that roof was last
	tarred. See now... the snow come this winter
	and sit up there on that roof like it is... and
	it’s gonna seep inside. It’s just gonna be a little bit... ain’t gonna hardly notice it. Then
	the next thing you know, it’s gonna be leaking all
	over the house. Then the wood rot from all that
	water and you gonna need a whole new roof. Now,
	how much you think it cost to get that roof tarred?
	CORY
	I don’t know.
	TROY 
	Two hundred and sixty-four dollars... cash
	money. While you thinking about a TV, I got to be
	thinking about the roof... and whatever else
	go wrong around here. Now if you had two hundred
	dollars, what would you do... fix the roof or
	buy a TV?
	CORY 
	I’d buy a TV. Then when the roof started to
	leak... when it needed fixing... I’d fix it.
	TROY 
	Where are you gonna get the money from? You done
	spent it for a TV. You gonna sit up and watch the
	water run all over your brand-new TV.
	CORY 
	Aw, Pop. You got money. I know you do.
	TROY 
	Where I got it at, huh?
	CORY 
	You got it in the bank.
	TROY 
	You wanna see my bankbook? You wanna see that
	$73.22 I got sitting up in there?
	CORY 
	You ain’t got to pay for it all at one time. You
	can put a down payment on it and carry it home
	with you.
	TROY 
	Not me. I ain’t gonna owe nobody nothing if I
	can help it. Miss a payment and they come and
	snatch it right out your house. Then what you
	got? Now, soon as I get two hundred dollars clear,
	then I’ll buy a TV. Right now, as soon as I get
	two hundred and sixty-four dollars, I’m gonna
	have this roof tarred.
	CORY 
	Aw... Pop!
	TROY 
	You go on and get you two hundred dollars and
	buy one if ya want it. I got better things to do
	with my money.
	CORY 
	I can’t get no two hundred dollars. I ain’t
	never seen two hundred dollars.
	TROY 
	I’ll tell you what... you get you a hundred
	dollars and I’ll put the other hundred with it.
	CORY 
	All right, I’m gonna show you.
	TROY 
	You gonna show me how you can cut them boards
	right now.
	CORY 
	The Pirates won today. That makes five in a row.
	TROY 
	I ain’t thinking about the Pirates. Got an allwhite team. Got that boy... that Puerto Rican
	boy... Clemente. Don’t even half-play him.
	That boy could be something if they give him a
	chance. Play him one day and sit him on the bench
	the next.
	CORY 
	He gets a lot of chances to play.
	TROY 
	I’m talking about playing regular. Playing every day so you can get your timing. That’s what
	I’m talking about.
	CORY 
	They got some white guys on the team that don’t
	play every day. You can’t play everybody at the
	same time.
	TROY 
	If they got a white fellow sitting on the
	bench... you can bet your last dollar he can’t
	play! The colored guy got to be twice as good before he get on the team. That’s why I don’t want
	you to get all tied up in them sports. Man on the
	team and what it get him? They got colored on the
	team and don’t use them. Same as not having them.
	All them teams the same.
	CORY 
	The Braves got Hank Aaron and Wes Covington.
	Hank Aaron hit two home runs today. That makes
	forty-three.
	TROY 
	Hank Aaron ain’t nobody. That’s what you supposed to do. That’s how you supposed to play the
	game. Ain’t nothing to it. It’s just a matter of
	timing... getting the right follow-through.
	Hell, I can hit forty-three home runs right now!
	CORY 
	Not off no major-league pitching, you couldn’t.
	TROY 
	We had better pitching in the Negro leagues. I
	hit seven home runs off of Satchel Paige. You
	can’t get no better than that!
	CORY 
	Sandy Koufax. He’s leading the league in strikeouts.
	TROY 
	I ain’t thinking of no Sandy Koufax.
	CORY 
	You got Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette. I bet you
	couldn’t hit no home runs off of Warren Spahn.
	TROY 
	I’m through with it now. You go on and cut them
	boards.
	Your mama tell me you done got recruited by a
	college football team? Is that right?
	CORY 
	Yeah. Coach Zellman say the recruiter gonna be
	coming by to talk to you. Get you to sign the
	permission papers.
	TROY 
	I thought you supposed to be working down there
	at the A&P. Ain’t you supposed to be working down
	there after school?
	CORY 
	Mr. Stawicki say he gonna hold my job for me
	until after the football season. Say starting
	next week I can work weekends.
	TROY 
	I thought we had an understanding about this
	football stuff? You suppose to keep up with your
	chores and hold that job down at the A&P. Ain’t
	been around here all day on a Saturday. Ain’t
	none of your chores done... and now you telling me you done quit your job.
	CORY 
	I’m gonna be working weekends.
	TROY 
	You damn right you are! And ain’t no need for
	nobody coming around here to talk to me about
	signing nothing.
	CORY 
	Hey, Pop... you can’t do that. He’s coming
	all the way from North Carolina.
	TROY 
	I don’t care where he coming from. The white man
	ain’t gonna let you get nowhere with that football no way. You go on and get your book-learning
	so you can work yourself up in that A&P or learn
	how to fix cars or build houses or something, get
	you a trade. That way you have something can’t
	nobody take away from you. You go on and learn how
	to put your hands to some good use. Besides hauling people’s garbage.
	CORY 
	I get good grades, Pop. That’s why the recruiter
	wants to talk with you. You got to keep up your
	grades to get recruited. This way I’ll be going
	to college. I’ll get a chance...
	TROY 
	First you gonna get your butt down there to the
	A&P and get your job back.
	CORY 
	Mr. Stawicki done already hired somebody else
	’cause I told him I was playing football.
	TROY 
	You a bigger fool than I thought... to let
	somebody take away your job so you can play some
	football. Where you gonna get your money to take
	out your girlfriend and whatnot? What kind of foolishness is that to let somebody take away your job?
	CORY 
	I’m still gonna be working weekends.
	TROY 
	Naw... naw. You getting your butt out of here
	and finding you another job.
	CORY 
	Come on, Pop! I got to practice. I can’t work
	after school and play football too. The team
	needs me. That’s what Coach Zellman say...
	TROY 
	I don’t care what nobody else say. I’m the
	boss... you understand? I’m the boss around
	here. I do the only saying what counts.
	CORY 
	Come on, Pop!
	Troy comes right up to Cory, in his
	face.
	TROY 
	I asked you... Did you understand?
	CORY 
	Yeah...
	TROY 
	What?!
	CORY 
	Yessir.
	TROY 
	Yessir.
	CORY
	Can I ask you a question?
	TROY 
	What the hell you wanna ask me? Mr. Stawicki the
	one you got the questions for.
	CORY 
	How come you ain’t never liked me?
	TROY 
	Liked you? Who the hell say I got to like you?
	What law is there say I got to like you? Wanna
	stand up in my face and ask a damn fool-ass question like that. Talking about liking somebody.
	Come here, boy, when I talk to you.
	TROY 
	Straighten up, goddamn it!
	TROY 
	I asked you a question... what law is there
	say I got to like you?
	CORY 
	None.
	TROY 
	Well, all right then! Don’t you eat every day?
	Cory looks down.
	TROY 
	Answer me when I talk to you! Don’t you eat every day?
	CORY 
	Yeah.
	TROY 
	Nigger, as long as you in my house, you put that
	sir on the end of it when you talk to me!
	CORY 
	Yes... sir.
	TROY 
	You eat every day.
	CORY 
	Yessir!
	TROY 
	Got a roof over your head.
	CORY 
	Yessir!
	TROY 
	Got clothes on your back.
	CORY 
	Yessir.
	TROY 
	Why you think that is?
	CORY 
	’Cause of you.
	TROY 
	Aw, hell, I know it’s ’cause of me... but why
	do you think that is?
	CORY
	’Cause you like me.
	TROY 
	Like you? I go out of here every morning...
	bust my butt... putting up with them crackers
	every day... ’cause I like you? You about the
	biggest fool I ever saw. It’s my job. It’s my responsibility! You understand that? A man got to
	take care of his family. You live in my house...
	sleep your behind on my bedclothes... fill you
	belly up with my food... ’cause you my son.
	TROY 
	You my flesh and blood. Not ’cause I like you!
	’Cause it’s my duty to take care of you. I owe a
	responsibility to you! Let’s get this straight
	right here... before it go along any further... I ain’t got to like you. Mr. Rand
	don’t give me my money come payday ’cause he
	likes me. He gives me ’cause he owe me. I done
	give you everything I had to give you. I gave you
	your life! Me and your mama worked that out between us. And liking your black ass wasn’t part
	of the bargain. Don’t you try and go through life
	worrying about if somebody like you or not. You
	best be making sure they doing right by you. You
	understand what I’m saying, boy?
	CORY 
	Yessir.
	TROY 
	Then get the hell out of my face, and get on
	down to that A&P.
	ROSE
	Why don’t you let the boy
	go ahead and play football, Troy? Ain’t no harm
	in that. He’s just trying to be like you with the
	sports.
	TROY 
	I don’t want him to be like me! I want him to
	move as far away from my life as he can get. You
	the only decent thing that ever happened to me. I
	wish him that. But I don’t wish him a thing else
	from my life.
	TROY 
	I decided seventeen years ago that boy wasn’t
	getting involved in no sports. Not after what
	they did to me in the sports.
	ROSE 
	Troy, why don’t you admit you was too old to
	play in the major leagues? For once... why
	don’t you admit that?
	TROY 
	What do you mean too old? Don’t come telling me
	I was too old. I just wasn’t the right color.
	Hell, I’m fifty-three years old and can do better
	than Selkirk’s .269 right now!
	ROSE 
	How’s was you gonna play ball when you were
	over forty? Sometimes I can’t get no sense out
	of you.
	TROY 
	I got good sense, woman. I got sense enough not
	to let my boy get hurt over playing no sports. You
	been mothering that boy too much. Worried about
	if people like him.
	ROSE 
	Everything that boy do... he do for you. He
	wants you to say, “Good job, son.” That’s all.
	TROY 
	Rose, I ain’t got time for that. He’s alive.
	He’s healthy. He’s got to make his own way. I made
	mine. Ain’t nobody gonna hold his hand when he
	get out there in that world.
	ROSE 
	Times have changed from when you was young,
	Troy. People change. The world’s changing around
	you and you can’t even see it.
	TROY
	Woman... I do the best I can
	do. I come in here every Friday. I carry a sack of
	potatoes and a bucket of lard. You all line up at
	the door with your hands out. I give you the lint
	from my pockets. I give you my sweat and my blood.
	I ain’t got no tears. I done spent them. We go upstairs in that room at night... and I fall down
	on you and try to blast a hole into forever. I get
	up Monday morning... find my lunch on the table.
	I go out. Make my way. Find my strength to carry me
	through to the next Friday. That’s all I got, Rose.
	TROY 
	That’s all I got to give. I can’t give nothing
	else!
	DEPUTY COMMISIONER
	The commissioner will see you now.
	BONO
	He told him the same thing he told you.
	Take it to the union.
	TROY
	Brownie ain’t got that much sense. Man wasn’t
	thinking about nothing. He wait until I confront
	them on it... then he wanna come crying seniority.
	rose! hey! rose!
	BONO 
	I wish I could have seen Mr. Rand’s face when
	he told you.
	TROY 
	He couldn’t get it out of his mouth! Liked to
	bit his tongue! When they called me down there to
	the commissioner’s office... he thought they
	was gonna fire me. Like everybody else.
	BONO 
	I didn’t think they was gonna fire you. I thought
	they was gonna put you on the warning paper.
	TROY 
	hey rose!
	Yeah, Mr. Rand like to bit his tongue.
	BONO 
	I see you run right down to Taylors’ and told
	that Alberta gal.
	TORY
	hey rose!
	I told everybody. HEY ROSE!
	I went down there to cash my check.
	ROSE 
	Hush all that hollering, man! I know you out
	here. What they say down there at the commissioner’s office?
	TROY
	You supposed to come when I call
	you, woman. Bono’ll tell you that.
	Don’t Lucille come when you call her?
	ROSE 
	Man, hush your mouth. I ain’t no dog... talk
	about... “come when you call me.”
	TROY
	You hear this, Bono? I had
	me an old dog used to get uppity like that. You
	say, “C’mere, Blue!”... and he just lay there
	and look at you.
	TROY 
	End up getting a stick and chasing him away trying to make him come.
	ROSE 
	I ain’t studying you and your dog. I remember
	you used to sing that old song.
	TROY
	Hear it ring! Hear it ring!
	Had an old dog his name was Blue.
	ROSE 
	Don’t nobody want to hear you sing that old
	song.
	TROY
	You know Blue was mighty true.
	ROSE 
	Used to have Cory running around here singing
	that song.
	BONO 
	Hell, I remember that song myself.
	TROY
	You know Blue was a good old dog.
	Blue treed a possum in a hollow log.
	That was my daddy’s song. My daddy made up that
	song.
	ROSE 
	I don’t care who made it up. Don’t nobody wanna
	hear you sing it.
	TROY
	Come here, woman.
	ROSE 
	You come in here carrying on, I reckon they
	ain’t fired you. What they say down there at the
	commissioner’s office?
	TROY 
	Look here, Rose... Mr.
	Rand called me into his office today when I got
	back from talking to them people down there...
	it come from up top... he called me in and
	told me they was making me a driver.
	ROSE 
	Troy, you kidding!
	TROY 
	No I ain’t. Ask Bono.
	ROSE 
	Well, that’s great, Troy. Now you don’t have to
	hassle them people no more.
	TROY 
	Aw hell... I wasn’t looking to see you today.
	I thought you was in jail. Got it all over the
	front page of the Courier about them raiding Seefus’ place... where you be hanging out with
	all them thugs.
	LYONS 
	Hey, Pop... that ain’t got nothing to do
	with me. I don’t go down there gambling. I go down
	there to sit in with the band. I ain’t got nothing
	to do with the gambling part. They got some good
	music down there.
	TROY 
	They got some rogues... is what they got.
	LYONS 
	How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.
	BONO 
	I see where you playing down at the Crawford
	Grill tonight.
	ROSE 
	How come you ain’t brought Bonnie like I told
	you. You should have brought Bonnie with you, she
	ain’t been over in a month of Sundays.
	LYONS 
	I was just in the neighborhood... thought
	I’d stop by.
	TROY 
	Here he come...
	BONO 
	Your daddy got a promotion on the rubbish. He’s
	gonna be the first colored driver. Ain’t got to do
	nothing but sit up there and read the paper like
	them white fellows.
	LYONS 
	Hey, Pop... if you knew how to read you’d be
	all right.
	BONO 
	Naw... naw... you mean if the nigger knew
	how to drive he’d be all right. Been fighting with
	them people about driving and ain’t even got a
	license. Mr. Rand know you ain’t got no driver’s
	license?
	TROY 
	Driving ain’t nothing. All you do is point the
	truck where you want it to go. Driving ain’t
	nothing.
	BONO 
	Do they know you ain’t got no driver’s license?
	That’s what I’m talking about. I ain’t asked if
	driving was easy. I asked if Mr. Rand know you
	ain’t got no driver’s license.
	TROY 
	He ain’t got to know. The man ain’t got to know
	my business. Time he find out, I have two or three
	driver’s licenses.
	LYONS
	Say, look here, Pop...
	TROY 
	I knew it was coming. Didn’t I tell you, Bono?
	I know what kind of “look here, Pop” that was. The
	nigger fixing to ask me for some money. It’s Friday night. It’s my payday. All them rogues down
	there on the avenue... the ones that ain’t in
	jail... and Lyons is hopping in his shoes to
	get down there with them.
	Lyons takes out a ten dollar bill and
	holds it out to Troy.
	LYONS 
	See, Pop... if you’d give somebody else a
	chance to talk sometime—you’d see that I was fixing to pay you back your ten dollars like I told
	you. Here... I told you I’d pay you when Bonnie got paid.
	TROY 
	Naw... you go ahead and keep that ten dollars. Put it in the bank. The next time you feel
	like you wanna come by here and ask me for something... you go on down there and get that.
	LYONS 
	Here’s your ten dollars, Pop. I told you I
	don’t want you to give me nothing. I just wanted
	to borrow ten dollars.
	TROY 
	Naw... you go on and keep that for the next
	time you want to ask me.
	LYONS 
	Come on, Pop... here go your ten dollars.
	ROSE 
	Why don’t you go on and let the boy pay you
	back, Troy?
	LYONS 
	Here you go, Rose. If you don’t take it I’m
	gonna have to hear about it for the next six
	months.
	ROSE 
	You can hand yours over here too, Troy.
	TROY 
	You see this Bono, you see how they do me?
	BONO 
	Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.
	GABRIEL 
	Better get ready for the judgement!
	Better get ready for...
	Hey!... Hey! There’s Troy’s boy!
	LYONS 
	How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
	GABRIEL 
	Lyons... The King of the Jungle!
	GABRIEL 
	Rose... hey, Rose. Got a flower for you.
	GABRIEL 
	Picked it myself. That’s the same rose like
	you is!
	ROSE 
	That’s right nice of you, Gabe.
	LYONS 
	What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?
	GABRIEL 
	Oh, I been chasing hellhounds and waiting on
	the time to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.
	LYONS 
	You been chasing hellhounds, huh? Well...
	you doing the right thing, Uncle Gabe. Somebody
	got to chase them.
	GABRIEL 
	Oh, yeah... I know it. The devil’s strong.
	The devil ain’t no pushover. Hellhounds snipping
	at everybody’s heels. But I got my trumpet waiting on the Judgment time.
	LYONS 
	Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon, huh?
	GABRIEL 
	Ain’t gonna be too much of a battle when God
	get to waving that Judgment sword. But the people’s gonna have a hell of a time trying to get
	into Heaven if them Gates ain’t open.
	LYONS
	You hear this, Pop?
	Uncle Gabe, you all right!
	GABRIEL
	Lyons! King of the Jungle.
	ROSE 
	You gonna stay for supper, Gabe? Want me to fix
	you a plate?
	GABRIEL 
	I’ll just take a sandwich, Rose. Don’t want
	no plate. Just wanna eat with my hands. I’ll take
	a sandwich.
	ROSE 
	How about you, Lyons? You staying? Got some
	short ribs cooking.
	LYONS 
	Naw, I won’t eat nothing till after we finished
	playing.
	You ought to come down and listen to me play,
	Pop.
	TROY 
	I don’t like that Chinese music. All that noise.
	ROSE 
	Go on in the house and wash up, Gabe... I’ll
	fix you a sandwich.
	GABRIEL
	Troy’s mad at me.
	LYONS 
	What you mad at Uncle Gabe for, Pop.
	ROSE 
	He thinks Troy’s mad at him ’cause he moved over
	to Miss Pearl’s.
	TROY 
	I ain’t mad at the man. He can live where he
	want to live at.
	LYONS 
	What he move over there for? Miss Pearl don’t
	like nobody.
	ROSE 
	She don’t mind him none. She treats him real
	nice. She just don’t allow all that singing.
	TROY 
	She don’t mind that rent he be paying...
	that’s what she don’t mind.
	ROSE 
	Troy, I ain’t going through that with you no
	more. He’s over there ’cause he want to have his
	own place. He can come and go as he please.
	TROY 
	Hell, he could come and go as he please here. I
	wasn’t stopping him. I ain’t put no rules on him.
	ROSE 
	It ain’t the same thing, Troy. And you know it.
	Now, that’s the last I wanna hear about that. I
	don’t wanna hear nothing else about Gabe and Miss
	Pearl. And next week...
	GABRIEL
	I’m ready for my sandwich, Rose.
	ROSE 
	And next week... when that recruiter come
	from that school... I want you to sign that
	paper and go on and let Cory play football. Then
	that’ll be the last I have to hear about that.
	TROY
	I ain’t thinking
	about Cory nothing.
	LYONS 
	What... Cory got recruited? What school he
	going to?
	TROY 
	That boy walking around here smelling his
	piss... thinking he’s grown. Thinking he’s
	gonna do what he want, irrespective of what I
	say. Look here, Bono... I left the commissioner’s office and went down to the A&P... that
	boy ain’t working down there. He lying to me.
	Telling me he got his job back... telling me
	he working weekends... telling me he working
	after school... Mr. Stawicki tell me he ain’t
	working down there at all!
	LYONS 
	Cory just growing up. He’s just busting at the
	seams trying to fill out your shoes.
	TROY 
	I don’t care what he’s doing. When he get to the
	point where he wanna disobey me... then it’s
	time for him to move on. Bono’ll tell you that. I
	bet he ain’t never disobeyed his daddy without
	paying the consequences.
	BONO 
	I ain’t never had a chance. My daddy came on
	through... But I ain’t never knew him to see
	him... or what he had on his mind or where he
	went. Just moving on through. Searching out the
	New Land. That’s what the old folks used to call
	it. See a fellow moving around from place to
	place... woman to woman... called it
	Searching out the New Land. I can’t say if he ever
	found it. I come along, didn’t want no kids.
	Didn’t know if I was gonna be in one place long
	enough to fix on them right as their daddy. I figured I was going searching too.
	BONO 
	As it turned out I been hooked up with Lucille
	near about as long as your daddy been with Rose.
	Going on sixteen years.
	TROY 
	Sometimes I wish I hadn’t known my daddy. He
	ain’t cared nothing about no kids. A kid to him
	wasn’t nothing. All he wanted was for you to
	learn how to walk so he could start you to working. When it come time for eating... he ate
	first. If there was anything left over, that’s
	what you got. Man would sit down and eat two
	chickens and give you the wing.
	LYONS 
	You ought to stop that, Pop. Everybody feed
	their kids. No matter how hard times is... everybody care about their kids. Make sure they
	have something to eat.
	TROY 
	The only thing my daddy cared about was getting
	them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin. That’s the
	only thing that mattered to him. Sometimes I used
	to wonder why he was living. Wonder why the devil
	hadn’t come and got him. “Get them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin” and find out he owe him
	money...
	LYONS 
	He should have just went on and left when he
	saw he couldn’t get nowhere. That’s what I would
	have done.
	TROY 
	How he gonna leave with eleven kids? And where
	he gonna go? He ain’t knew how to do nothing but
	farm. No, he was trapped and I think he knew it.
	But I’ll say this for him... he felt a responsibility toward us. Maybe he ain’t treated us the
	way I felt he should have... but without that
	responsibility he could have walked off and left
	us... made his own way.
	BONO 
	A lot of them did. Back in those days what you
	talking about... they walk out their front
	door and just take on down one road or another and
	keep on walking.
	LYONS 
	There you go! That’s what I’m talking about.
	Troy offers Bono the bottle.
	BONO 
	Just keep on walking till you come to something
	else. Ain’t you never heard of nobody having the
	walking blues? Well, that’s what you call it when
	you just take off like that.
	TROY 
	My daddy ain’t had them walking blues! What you
	talking about? He stayed right there with his
	family. But he was just as evil as he could be.
	My mama couldn’t stand him. Couldn’t stand that
	evilness. She run off when I was about eight.
	TROY
	She sneaked off one night after he had
	gone to sleep. Told me she was coming back for me.
	I ain’t never seen her no more. All his women run
	off and left him. He wasn’t good for nobody.
	TROY 
	When my turn come to head out, I was fourteen
	and got to sniffing around Joe Canewell’s daughter.
	TROY
	Had us an old mule we called Greyboy. My
	daddy sent me out to do some plowing and I tied
	up Greyboy and went to fooling around with Joe
	Canewell’s daughter. We done found us a nice
	spot, got real cozy with each other. She about
	thirteen and we done figured we was grown anyway... So we down there enjoying ourselves... ain’t thinking about nothing.
	TROY
	We didn’t know Greyboy had got loose and
	wandered back to the house and my daddy was looking for me. We down there by the creek enjoying
	ourselves when my daddy come up on us.
	TROY 
	Surprised us. He had them leather straps off the
	mule and commenced to whupping me like there was
	no tomorrow. I jumped up, mad and embarrassed. I
	was scared of my daddy.
	TROY 
	When he commenced to whupping on me... quite
	naturally I run to get out of the way. Now I
	thought he was mad ’cause I ain’t done my work.
	But I see where he was chasing me off so he could
	have the gal for himself. When I see what the
	matter of it was, I lost all fear of my daddy.
	Right there is where I become a man... at
	fourteen years of age.
	TROY
	Now it was my turn to run him off. I
	picked up them same reins that he had used on me.
	I picked up them reins and commenced to whupping
	on him. The gal jumped up and run off... and
	when my daddy turned to face me, I could see why
	the devil had never come to get him...
	TROY
	...’cause he was the devil himself.
	TROY 
	I don’t know what happened. When I woke up, I
	was laying right there by the creek, and Blue...
	this old dog we had... was licking my face. I
	thought I was blind. I couldn’t see nothing. Both
	my eyes were swollen shut. I laid there and cried.
	I didn’t know what I was gonna do.
	TROY 
	The only thing I knew was the time had come for
	me to leave my daddy’s house. And right there the
	world suddenly got big. And it was a long time
	before I could cut it down to where I could handle
	it.
	LYONS 
	What you got there, Uncle Gabe?
	GABRIEL 
	Got me a ham sandwich. Rose gave me a ham
	sandwich.
	TROY 
	I don’t know what happened to him. I done lost
	touch with everybody except Gabriel. But I hope
	he’s dead. I hope he found some peace.
	LYONS 
	That’s a heavy story, Pop. I didn’t know you
	left home when you was fourteen.
	The phone rings inside the house.
	LYONS 
	Fourteen’s kinda young to be out on your own.
	I don’t know what I would have done.
	TROY 
	I got up from the creek and walked on down to
	Mobile. I was through with farming.
	Figured I could do better in the city. So I
	walked the two hundred miles to Mobile.
	LYONS 
	Wait a minute... you ain’t walked no two
	hundred miles, Pop. Ain’t nobody gonna walk no
	two hundred miles. You talking about some walking
	there.
	BONO 
	That’s the only way you got anywhere back in
	them days.
	LYONS 
	Shhh. Damn if I wouldn’t have hitched a ride
	with somebody!
	TROY 
	Who you gonna hitch it with? They ain’t had no
	cars and things like they got now.
	TROY 
	We talking about 1918.
	ROSE 
	What you all out here getting into?
	TROY
	I’m telling Lyons how good he got it.
	He don’t know nothing about this I’m talking.
	ROSE 
	Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone. She say you
	supposed to pick her up.
	LYONS 
	Yeah, okay, Rose.
	TROY 
	I walked on down to Mobile and hitched up with
	some of them fellows that was heading this way.
	Got up here and found out... not only couldn’t
	you get a job... you couldn’t find no place to
	live. I thought I was in freedom. Shhh. Colored
	folks living down there on the riverbanks in
	whatever kind of shelter they could find for themselves. Right down there under the Brady Street
	Bridge. Living in shacks made of sticks and tar
	paper.
	TROY 
	Messed around there and went from bad to worse.
	Started stealing. First it was food. Then I figured, hell, if I steal money I can buy me some
	food. Buy me some shoes too! One thing led to
	another. Met your mama. I was young and anxious
	to be a man. Met your mama and had you. What I do
	that for?
	TROY 
	Now I got to worry about feeding you and her.
	Got to steal three times as much. Went out one day
	looking for somebody to rob... that’s what I
	was, a robber. I’ll tell you the truth. I’m
	ashamed of it today. But it’s the truth. Went to
	rob this fellow... pulled out my knife...
	and he pulled out a gun. Shot me in the chest. It
	felt just like somebody had taken a hot branding
	iron and laid it on me. When he shot me I jumped
	at him with my knife. They told me I killed him
	and they put me in the penitentiary and locked me
	up for fifteen years. That’s where I met Bono.
	That’s where I learned how to play baseball. Got
	out that place and your mama had taken you and
	went on to make a life without me.
	TROY 
	Fifteen years was a long time for her to wait.
	But that fifteen years cured me of that robbing
	stuff.
	Rose’ll tell you. She asked me when I met her
	if I had gotten all that foolishness out of my
	system. And I told her, “Baby, it’s you and baseball all what count with me.” You hear me, Bono?
	I meant it too. She say, “Which one comes first?”
	I told her, “Baby, ain’t no doubt it’s baseball... but you stick and get old with me and
	we’ll both outlive this baseball.” Am I right,
	Rose? And it’s true.
	ROSE 
	Man, hush your mouth. You ain’t said no such
	thing. Talking about, “Baby, you know you’ll always be number one with me.” That’s what you was
	talking.
	TROY 
	You hear that, Bono. That’s why I love her.
	BONO 
	Rose’ll keep you straight. You get off the
	track, she’ll straighten you up.
	ROSE 
	Lyons, you better get on up and get Bonnie. She
	waiting on you.
	LYONS 
	Hey, Pop, why don’t you come on down to the
	Grill and hear me play?
	TROY 
	I ain’t going down there. I’m too old to be sitting around in them clubs.
	BONO 
	You got to be good to play down at the Grill.
	LYONS 
	Come on, Pop...
	TROY 
	I got to get up in the morning.
	LYONS 
	You ain’t got to stay long.
	TROY
	Naw, I’m gonna get my supper and go on
	to bed.
	LYONS 
	Well, I gotta go. I’ll see you again.
	TROY 
	Don’t you come around my house on my payday.
	ROSE 
	Pick up the phone and let somebody know you coming.
	And bring Bonnie with you. You know I’m always glad to see her.
	LYONS 
	Yeah, I’ll do that, Rose. You take care now.
	See you, Pop. See you, Mr. Bono.
	See you, Uncle Gabe.
	GABRIEL
	Lyons! King of the Jungle!
	TROY
	Is supper ready, woman? Me and you got
	some business to take care of. I’m gonna tear it
	up too.
	ROSE 
	Troy, I done told you now!
	TROY 
	Aw hell, woman... this is Bono. Bono like
	family. I done known this nigger since... how
	long I done know you?
	BONO 
	It’s been a long time.
	TROY 
	I done known this nigger since Skippy was a pup.
	Me and him done been through some times.
	BONO 
	You sure right about that.
	TROY 
	Hell, I done know him longer than I known you.
	And we still standing shoulder to shoulder. Hey,
	look here, Bono... a man can’t ask for no more
	than that. I love you, nigger.
	BONO 
	Hell, I love you too... but I got to get home
	see my woman. You got yours in hand. I got to go
	get mine.
	CORY 
	What you do that for, Pop?
	Rose comes out.
	ROSE 
	What’s the matter? Cory... what’s the matter?
	CORY 
	Papa done went up to the school and told Coach
	Zellman I can’t play football no more. Wouldn’t
	even let me play the game. Told him to tell the
	recruiter not to come.
	ROSE 
	Troy...
	TROY 
	What you Troying me for. Yeah, I did it. And the
	boy know why I did it.
	CORY 
	Why you wanna do that to me? That was the one
	chance I had.
	ROSE 
	Ain’t nothing wrong with Cory playing football,
	Troy.
	TROY 
	The boy lied to me. I told the nigger if he
	wanna play football... to keep up his chores
	and hold down that job at the A&P. That was the
	conditions. Stopped down there to see Mr. Stawicki...
	CORY 
	I can’t work after school during the football
	season, Pop! I tried to tell you that Mr. Stawicki’s holding my job for me. You don’t never want
	to listen to nobody. And then you wanna go and do
	this to me!
	TROY 
	I ain’t done nothing to you. You done it to
	yourself
	CORY 
	Just ’cause you didn’t have a chance! You just
	scared I’m gonna be better than you, that’s all.
	TROY 
	Come here.
	ROSE
	Troy...
	TROY 
	All right! See. You done made a mistake.
	CORY 
	I didn’t even do nothing!
	TROY 
	I’m gonna tell you what your mistake was.
	TROY 
	See... you swung at the ball and didn’t hit
	it. That’s strike one. See, you in the batter’s box
	now. You swung and you missed. That’s strike one.
	TROY 
	Don’t you strike out!
	ROSE 
	Cory, I want you to help me with this cupboard.
	CORY 
	I ain’t quitting the team. I don’t care what
	Poppa say.
	ROSE 
	I’ll talk to him when he gets back. He had to
	go see about your Uncle Gabe. The police done arrested him. Say he was disturbing the peace.
	He’ll be back directly. Come on in here and help
	me clean out the top of this cupboard.
	ROSE
	Troy... What they say down there?
	TROY 
	Ain’t said nothing. I give them fifty dollars and
	they let him go. I’ll talk to you about it.
	Where’s Cory?
	ROSE 
	He’s in there helping me clean out these cupboards.
	TROY 
	Tell him to get his butt out here.
	TROY 
	All they want is the money. That makes six or
	seven times I done went down there and got him.
	See me coming they stick out their hands.
	BONO 
	Yeah. I know what you mean. That’s all they care
	about... that money. They don’t care about
	what’s right.
	Nigger, why you got to go and get some hard
	wood? You ain’t doing nothing but building a little old fence. Get you some soft pine wood. That’s
	all you need.
	TROY 
	I know what I’m doing. This is outside wood. You
	put pine wood inside the house. Pine wood is inside wood. This here is outside wood. Now you
	tell me where the fence is gonna be?
	BONO 
	You don’t need this wood. You can put it up with
	pine wood and it’ll stand as long as you gonna be
	here looking at it.
	TROY 
	How you know how long I’m gonna be here, nigger?
	Hell, I might just live forever. Live longer than
	old man Horsely.
	BONO 
	That’s what Magee used to say.
	TROY 
	Magee’s a damn fool. Now you tell me who you
	ever heard of gonna pull their own teeth with a
	pair of rusty pliers.
	BONO 
	The old folks... my granddaddy used to pull
	his teeth with pliers. They ain’t had no dentists
	for the colored folks back then.
	TROY 
	Get clean pliers! You understand? Clean pliers!
	Sterilize them! Besides we ain’t living back
	then. All Magee had to do was walk over to Doc
	Goldblum’s.
	BONO 
	I see where you and that Tallahassee gal...
	that Alberta... I see where you all done got
	tight.
	TROY 
	What you mean “got tight”?
	BONO 
	I see where you be laughing and joking with her
	all the time.
	TROY 
	I laughs and jokes with all of them, Bono. You
	know me.
	BONO 
	That ain’t the kind of laughing and joking I’m
	talking about.
	CORY 
	How you doing, Mr. Bono?
	TROY 
	Get that saw from Bono and cut some wood. He
	talking about the wood’s too hard to cut.
	Stand back there, Jim, and let that young boy
	show you how it’s done.
	BONO 
	He’s sure welcome to it.
	BONO 
	Whew-e-e! Look at that. Big old strong boy. Look
	like Joe Louis. Hell, must be getting old the way
	I’m watching that boy whip through that wood.
	CORY 
	I don’t see why Mama want a fence around the
	yard noways.
	TROY 
	Damn if I know either. What the hell she keeping
	out with it? She ain’t got nothing nobody want.
	BONO 
	Some people build fences to keep people out...
	and other people build fences to keep people in.
	Rose wants to hold on to you all. She loves you.
	TROY 
	Hell, nigger, I don’t need nobody to tell me my
	wife loves me. Cory... go on in and see if you
	can find that other saw.
	CORY 
	Where’s it at?
	TROY 
	I said find it! Look for it till you find it!
	TROY 
	What’s that supposed to mean? Wanna keep us in?
	BONO
	Troy... I done
	known you seem like damn near my whole life. You
	and Rose both. I done know both of you all for
	a long time. I remember when you met Rose. When
	you was hitting them baseballs out the park. A
	lot of them old gals was after you then. You had
	the pick of the litter. When you picked Rose, I
	was happy for you. That was the first time I knew
	you had any sense. I said... My man Troy
	knows what he’s doing... I’m gonna follow
	this nigger... he might take me somewhere. I
	been following you too. I done learned a whole
	heap of things about life watching you. I done
	learned how to tell where the shit lies. How to
	tell it from the alfalfa. You done learned me a
	lot of things. You showed me how to not make the
	same mistakes... to take life as it comes
	along and keep putting one foot in front of the
	other.
	Rose a good woman, Troy.
	TROY 
	Hell, nigger, I know she a good woman. I been
	married to her for eighteen years. What you got
	on your mind, Bono?
	BONO 
	I just say she a good woman. Just like I say
	anything. I ain’t got to have nothing on my mind.
	TROY 
	You just gonna say she a good woman and leave
	it hanging out there like that? Why you telling
	me she a good woman?
	BONO 
	She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.
	TROY 
	You saying I don’t measure up. That’s what you
	trying to say. I don’t measure up ’cause I’m seeing this other gal. I know what you trying to say.
	BONO 
	I know what Rose means to you, Troy. I’m just
	trying to say I don’t want to see you mess up.
	TROY 
	Yeah, I appreciate that, Bono. If you was messing around on Lucille I’d be telling you the same
	thing.
	BONO 
	Well, that’s all I got to say. I just say that
	because I love you both.
	TROY 
	Hell, you know me... I wasn’t out there looking for nothing. You can’t find a better woman
	than Rose. I know that. But seems like this woman
	just stuck on to me where I can’t shake her loose.
	I done wrestled with it, tried to throw her off
	me... but she just stuck on tighter. Now she’s
	stuck on for good.
	BONO 
	You’s in control... that’s what you tell me
	all the time. You responsible for what you do.
	TROY 
	I ain’t ducking the responsibility of it. As
	long as it sets right in my heart... then I’m
	okay. ’Cause that’s all I listen to. It’ll tell
	me right from wrong every time. And I ain’t
	talking about doing Rose no bad turn. I love
	Rose. She done carried me a long ways and I love
	and respect her for that.
	BONO 
	I know you do. That’s why I don’t want to see
	you hurt her. But what you gonna do when she find
	out? What you got then? If you try and juggle both
	of them... sooner or later you gonna drop one
	of them. That’s common sense.
	TROY 
	Yeah, I hear what you saying, Bono. I been trying to figure a way to work it out.
	BONO
	Work it out right, Troy. I
	don’t want to be getting all up between you and
	Rose’s business... but work it so it come out
	right.
	TROY 
	Aw hell, I get all up between you and Lucille’s
	business. When you gonna get that woman that refrigerator she been wanting? Don’t tell me you
	ain’t got no money now. I know who your banker is.
	Mellon don’t need that money bad as Lucille want
	that refrigerator. I’ll tell you that.
	BONO 
	Tell you what I’ll do... when you finish
	building this fence for Rose... I’ll buy Lucille that refrigerator.
	TROY 
	You done stuck your foot in your mouth now!
	TROY 
	Hey, nigger... where you going?
	BONO 
	I’m going home. I know you don’t expect me to
	help you now. I’m protecting my money. I wanna
	see you put up that fence by yourself. That’s
	what I want to see.
	You’ll be here another six months without me.
	TROY 
	Nigger, you ain’t right...
	BONO 
	When it comes to my money... I’m right as
	fireworks on the Fourth of July.
	TROY
	All right, we gonna see now.
	You better get out your bankbook.
	ROSE 
	What they say down there? What’s happening with
	Gabe?
	TROY 
	I went down there and got him out. Cost me fifty
	dollars. Say he was disturbing the peace. Judge
	set up a hearing for him in three weeks. Say to
	show cause why he shouldn’t be recommitted.
	ROSE 
	Well, what’s you say? What’d you tell the judge?
	TROY 
	Told him I’d look after him. It didn’t make no
	sense to recommit the man. He stuck out his big
	greasy palm, and told me to give him fifty dollars
	and take him on home.
	ROSE 
	Where’s he at now? Where’d he go off to?
	TROY 
	He’s gone on about his business. He don’t need
	nobody to hold his hand.
	ROSE 
	Well, I don’t know. Seem like that would be the
	best place for him if they did put him into the
	hospital. I know what you’re gonna say. But that’s
	what I think would be best.
	TROY 
	The man done had his life ruined fighting for
	what? And they wanna take and lock him up. Let him
	be free. He don’t bother nobody.
	ROSE 
	Well, everybody got their own way of looking at
	it I guess. Come on and get your lunch. I got a
	bowl of lima beans and some cornbread in the
	oven. Come on get something to eat. Ain’t no
	sense you fretting over Gabe.
	TROY 
	Rose... got something to tell you.
	ROSE 
	Well, come on... wait till I get this food
	on the table.
	TROY 
	Rose.
	She turns around.
	TROY 
	I don’t know how to say this.
	I can’t explain it none. It just sort of grows
	on you till it gets out of hand. It starts out
	like a little bush... and the next thing you
	know it’s a whole forest.
	ROSE 
	Troy... what is you talking about?
	TROY 
	I’m talking, woman, let me talk. I’m trying to
	find a way to tell you... I’m gonna be a daddy.
	I’m gonna be somebody’s daddy.
	ROSE 
	Troy... you’re not telling me this? You’re
	gonna be... what?
	TROY 
	Rose... now... see...
	ROSE 
	You telling me you gonna be somebody’s daddy?
	You telling your wife this?
	GABRIEL
	Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!
	ROSE 
	I have to wait eighteen years to hear something
	like this.
	GABRIEL 
	Hey, Rose... I got a flower for you.
	That’s a rose. Same rose like you is.
	ROSE 
	Thanks, Gabe.
	GABRIEL 
	Troy, you ain’t mad at me is you? Them bad
	mens come and put me away. You ain’t mad at me is
	you?
	TROY 
	Naw, Gabe, I ain’t mad at you.
	ROSE 
	Eighteen years and you wanna come with this.
	GABRIEL
	See what I got?
	Got a brand-new quarter.
	TROY 
	Rose... it’s just...
	ROSE 
	Ain’t nothing you can say, Troy. Ain’t no way
	of explaining that.
	GABRIEL 
	Fellow that give me this quarter had a whole
	mess of them. I’m gonna keep this quarter till it
	stop shining.
	ROSE 
	Gabe, go on up front now. I got some watermelon
	in the Frigidaire. I’ll get you a piece.
	GABRIEL 
	Say, Rose... you know I was chasing hellhounds and them bad mens come and get me and take
	me away. Troy helped me. He come down there and
	told them they better let me go before he beat
	them up. Yeah, he did!
	ROSE 
	You go on up front and I’ll get you a piece of
	watermelon, Gabe. Them bad mens is gone now.
	GABRIEL 
	Okay, Rose... gonna bring me some watermelon. The kind with the stripes on it.
	ROSE 
	Why, Troy? Why? After all these years to come
	dragging this in to me now. It don’t make no sense
	at your age. I could have expected this ten or
	fifteen years ago, but not now.
	TROY 
	Age ain’t got nothing to do with it, Rose.
	ROSE 
	I done tried to be everything a wife should be.
	Everything a wife could be. Been married eighteen
	years and I got to live to see the day you tell
	me you been seeing another woman and done fathered a child by her. And you know I ain’t never
	wanted no half-nothing in my family. My whole
	family is half. Everybody got different fathers
	and mothers... my two sisters and my brother.
	Can’t hardly tell who’s who. Can’t never sit down
	and talk about Papa and Mama. It’s your papa and
	your mama and my papa and my mama...
	TROY 
	Rose... stop it now.
	ROSE 
	I ain’t never wanted that for none of my children. And now you wanna drag your behind in here
	and tell me something like this.
	TROY 
	You ought to know. It’s time for you to know.
	ROSE 
	Well, I don’t want to know, goddamn it!
	TROY 
	I can’t just make it go away. It’s done now. I
	can’t wish the circumstance of the thing away.
	ROSE 
	And you don’t want to either. Maybe you want to
	wish me and my boy away. Maybe that’s what you
	want? Well, you can’t wish us away. I’ve got
	eighteen years of my life invested in you. You
	ought to have stayed upstairs in my bed where you
	belong.
	TROY 
	Rose... now listen to me... we can get a
	handle on this thing. We can talk this out...
	come to an understanding.
	ROSE 
	All of a sudden it’s “we.” Where was “we” at
	when you was down there rolling around with some
	godforsaken woman? “We” should have come to an
	understanding before you started making a damn
	fool of yourself. You’re a day late and a dollar
	short when it comes to an understanding with me.
	TROY 
	It’s just... She gives me a different
	idea... a different understanding about myself. I can step out of this house and get away
	from the pressures and problems... be a different man. I ain’t got to wonder how I’m gonna
	pay the bills or get the roof fixed. I can just be
	a part of myself that I ain’t never been.
	ROSE 
	What I want to know... is do you plan to continue seeing her. That’s all you can say to me.
	TROY 
	I can sit up in her house and laugh. Do you understand what I’m saying. I can laugh out
	loud... and it feels good. It reaches all the
	way down to the bottom of my shoes.
	ROSE 
	Maybe you ought to go on and stay down there
	with her... if she a better woman than me.
	TROY 
	It ain’t about nobody being a better woman or
	nothing. Rose, you ain’t to blame. A man couldn’t
	ask for no woman to be a better wife than you’ve
	been. I’m responsible for it. I done locked myself into a pattern trying to take care of you all
	that I forgot about myself.
	ROSE 
	What the hell was I there for? That was my job,
	not somebody else’s.
	TROY 
	Rose, I done tried all my life to live decent... to live a clean... hard... useful life. I tried to be a good husband to you. In
	every way I knew how. Maybe I come into the world
	backwards, I don’t know. But... You born with
	two strikes on you before you come to the plate.
	You got to guard it closely... always looking
	for the curveball on the inside corner. You can’t
	afford to let none get past you. You can’t afford
	a call strike.
	TROY 
	If you going down... you going down swinging. Everything lined up against you. What you
	gonna do. I fooled them, Rose. I bunted. When I
	found you and Cory and a halfway decent job...
	I was safe. Couldn’t nothing touch me. I wasn’t
	gonna strike out no more. I wasn’t going back to
	the penitentiary. I wasn’t gonna lay in the
	streets with a bottle of wine. I was safe. I had
	me a family. A job. I wasn’t gonna get that last
	strike. I was on first looking for one of them boys
	to knock me in. To get me home.
	ROSE 
	You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.
	TROY 
	Then when I saw that gal... she firmed up my
	backbone. And I got to thinking that if I
	tried... I just might be able to steal second.
	Do you understand, after eighteen years I wanted
	to steal second.
	ROSE 
	You should have held me tight. You should have
	grabbed me and held on.
	TROY 
	I stood on first base for eighteen years and I
	thought... well, goddamn it... go on for
	it!
	ROSE 
	We’re not talking about baseball! We’re talking
	about you going off to lay in bed with another
	woman... and then bring it home to me. That’s
	what we’re talking about. We ain’t talking about
	no baseball.
	TROY 
	Rose, you’re not listening to me. I’m trying the
	best I can to explain it to you. It’s not easy for
	me to admit that I been standing in the same place
	for eighteen years.
	ROSE 
	I been standing with you! I been right here with
	you, Troy. I got a life too. I gave eighteen years
	of my life to stand in the same spot with you.
	Don’t you think I ever wanted other things? Don’t
	you think I had dreams and hopes? What about my
	life? What about me? Don’t you think it ever
	crossed my mind to want to know other men? That I
	wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my
	responsibilities? That I wanted someone to make
	me laugh so I could feel good?
	ROSE 
	You not the only one who’s got wants and needs.
	But I held on to you, Troy. I took all my feelings, my wants and needs, my dreams... and I
	buried them inside you. I planted a seed and
	watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom. And it didn’t take
	me no eighteen years to find out the soil was hard
	and rocky and it wasn’t never gonna bloom.
	ROSE 
	But I held on to you, Troy. I held you tighter.
	You was my husband. I owed you everything I had.
	Every part of me I could find to give you. And upstairs in that room... with the darkness falling in on me... I gave everything I had to try
	and erase the doubt that you wasn’t the finest man
	in the world, and wherever you was going... I
	wanted to be there with you. ’Cause you was my
	husband. ’Cause that’s the only way I was gonna
	survive as your wife. You always talking about
	what you give... and what you don’t have to
	give. But you take too. You take... and don’t
	even know nobody’s giving!
	You say I take and don’t give!
	ROSE 
	Troy! You’re hurting me!
	TROY 
	You say I take and don’t give.
	ROSE 
	Troy... you’re hurting my arm! Let go.
	TROY 
	I done give you everything I got. Don’t you tell
	that lie on me.
	ROSE 
	Troy!
	TROY 
	Don’t you tell that lie on me!
	Cory rushing out of the house.
	CORY 
	Mama!
	ROSE 
	Troy. You’re hurting me.
	TROY 
	Don’t you tell me about no taking and giving.
	ROSE 
	Troy. Troy. No!
	Cory.
	ROSE 
	Troy... no. Please! Troy!
	TROY
	All right. That’s strike two. You stay
	away from around me, boy. Don’t you strike out.
	You living with a full count. DON’T YOU STRIKE
	out!
	ROSE 
	Troy, I want to talk to you.
	TROY 
	All of a sudden, after all this time, you want
	to talk to me, huh? You ain’t wanted to talk to
	me for months. You ain’t wanted to talk to me last
	night. You ain’t wanted no part of me then. What
	you wanna talk to me about now?
	Rose looks around at the men who
	glance at her and Troy as they pass
	by.
	ROSE 
	Tomorrow’s Friday.
	TROY 
	I know what day tomorrow is. You think I don’t
	know tomorrow’s Friday? My whole life I ain’t
	done nothing but look to see Friday coming and
	you got to tell me it’s Friday.
	ROSE 
	I want to know if you’re coming home.
	TROY 
	I always come home, Rose. You know that. There
	ain’t never been a night I ain’t come home.
	ROSE 
	That ain’t what I mean... and you know it. I
	want to know if you’re coming straight home after
	work.
	TROY 
	I figure I’d cash my check... hang out at Taylors’ with the boys... maybe play a game of
	checkers...
	ROSE 
	Troy, I can’t live like this. I won’t live like
	this. You livin’ on borrowed time with me. It’s
	been going on six months now you ain’t been coming home.
	TROY 
	I be home every night. Every night of the year.
	That’s 365 days.
	ROSE 
	I want you to come home tomorrow after work.
	TROY 
	Rose... I don’t mess up my pay. You know that
	now. I take my pay and I give it to you. I don’t
	have no money but what you give me back. I just
	want to have a little time to myself... a little time to enjoy life.
	ROSE 
	What about me? When’s my time to enjoy life.
	TROY 
	I don’t know what to tell you, Rose. I’m doing
	the best I can.
	ROSE 
	You ain’t been coming home from work but time
	enough to change your clothes and run out...
	and you wanna call that the best you can do?
	TROY 
	I’m going over to the hospital to see Alberta.
	She went into the hospital this afternoon. Look
	like she might have the baby early. I won’t be
	gone long.
	Troy starts to walk away.
	ROSE
	Well, you ought to know. They went
	over to Miss Pearl’s and got Gabe today. She said
	you told them to go ahead and lock him up.
	TROY 
	I ain’t said no such thing. Whoever told you
	that is telling a lie. Pearl ain’t doing nothing
	but telling a big fat lie.
	ROSE 
	She ain’t had to tell me. I read it on the papers.
	TROY 
	I ain’t told them nothing of the kind.
	ROSE 
	I saw it right there on the papers.
	TROY 
	What it say, huh?
	ROSE 
	It said you told them to take him.
	TROY 
	Then they screwed that up, just the way they
	screw up everything. I ain’t worried about what
	they got on the paper.
	ROSE 
	Say the government send part of his check to the
	hospital and the other part to you.
	TROY 
	I ain’t got nothing to do with that if that’s
	the way it works. I ain’t made up the rules about
	how it work.
	ROSE 
	You did Gabe just like you did Cory. You wouldn’t
	sign the paper for Cory... but you signed for
	Gabe. You signed that paper.
	TROY 
	I told you I ain’t signed nothing, woman! The
	only thing I signed was the release form. Hell, I
	can’t read, I don’t know what they had on that
	paper! I ain’t signed nothing about sending Gabe
	away.
	ROSE 
	I said send him to the hospital... you said
	let him be free... now you done went down
	there and signed him to the hospital for half his
	money. You went back on yourself, Troy. You gonna
	have to answer for that.
	TROY 
	See now... you been over there talking to
	Miss Pearl. She done got mad ’cause she ain’t
	getting Gabe’s rent money. That’s all it is.
	She’s liable to say anything.
	ROSE 
	Troy, I seen where you signed the paper.
	TROY 
	You ain’t seen nothing I signed. What she doing
	got papers on my brother anyway? Miss Pearl telling a big fat lie. And I’m gonna tell her about
	it too!
	TROY 
	You ain’t seen nothing I signed! Say... you
	ain’t seen nothing I signed!
	CORY
	Mama?
	ROSE 
	Troy... that was the hospital. Alberta had
	the baby.
	TROY 
	What she have? What is it?
	ROSE 
	It’s a girl.
	TROY 
	I better get on down to the hospital to see her.
	ROSE 
	Troy...
	TROY 
	Rose... I got to go see her now. That’s only
	right... what’s the matter... the baby’s
	all right, ain’t it?
	ROSE 
	Alberta died having the baby.
	TROY
	Died... you say she’s dead? Alberta’s dead?
	ROSE 
	They said they done all they could. They couldn’t
	do nothing for her.
	TROY
	The baby? How’s the baby?
	ROSE 
	They say it’s healthy.
	ROSE 
	I wonder who’s gonna bury her.
	TROY 
	She had family, Rose. She wasn’t living in the
	world by herself.
	ROSE 
	I know she wasn’t living in the world by herself.
	TROY 
	Next thing you gonna want to know if she had any
	insurance.
	ROSE 
	Troy, you ain’t got to talk like that.
	TROY 
	That’s the first thing that jumped out your
	mouth. “Who’s gonna bury her?” Like I’m fixing to
	take on that task for myself.
	ROSE 
	I am your wife. Don’t push me away.
	TROY 
	I ain’t pushing nobody away.
	Just give me some space. That’s all.
	TROY 
	Just give me some room to breathe!
	TROY 
	All right... Mr. Death. See now... I’m
	gonna tell you what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna take
	and build me a fence around this yard.
	TROY 
	See? I’m gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me. And then I want you to stay on the
	other side. See? You stay over there until you’re
	ready for me.
	TROY 
	Then you come on. Bring your army. Bring your
	sickle. Bring your wrestling clothes. I ain’t
	gonna fall down on my vigilance this time. You
	ain’t gonna sneak up on me no more.
	TROY 
	When you ready for me... when the top of your
	list say Troy Maxson... You come up and knock
	on the front door. Ain’t nobody else got nothing
	to do with this.
	TROY
	This is between you and me.
	TROY
	Man to man. You stay on the other side of
	that fence until you ready for me.
	CORY
	Mama, what’s—
	TROY
	Then you come up and—
	TROY 
	—and you knock on the front door! Anytime you
	want!
	I’ll be ready for you!
	TROY 
	Rose... I’m standing here with my daughter in
	my arms. She ain’t but a wee bitty little old
	thing. She don’t know nothing about grownups’ business. She innocent... and she ain’t got no mama.
	ROSE
	What you telling me for, Troy?
	She passes Troy and goes into the
	kitchen. Troy stands still. The radio
	blares the baseball game.
	TROY 
	Well... I guess we’ll just sit out here on
	the porch.
	A man’s got to do what’s right for him. I ain’t
	sorry for nothing I done. It felt right in my heart.
	TROY 
	What you smiling at? Your daddy’s a big man. Got
	these great big old hands. But sometimes he’s
	scared. And right now your daddy’s scared ‘cause
	we sitting out here and ain’t got no home. Oh, I
	been homeless before. I ain’t had no little baby
	with me. But I been homeless.
	TROY 
	You just be out on the road by your lonesome and
	you see one of them trains coming and you just
	kinda go like this...
	Please, Mr. Engineer, let a man ride the
	line...
	Please, Mr. Engineer, let a man ride the
	line...
	I ain’t got no ticket please let me ride the
	blinds.
	TROY 
	She’s my daughter, Rose. My own flesh and blood.
	I can’t deny her no more than I can deny them boys.
	You and them boys is my family. You and them
	and this child is all I got in the world. So I
	guess what I’m saying is... I’d appreciate it
	if you’d help me take care of her.
	ROSE 
	Okay, Troy... you’re right. I’ll take care
	of your baby for you... ’cause... like you
	say... she’s innocent... and you can’t
	visit the sins of the father upon the child. A
	motherless child has got a hard time.
	ROSE 
	From right now... this child got a mother.
	But you a womanless man.
	TROY 
	I’m coming in and everybody’s going out.
	ROSE 
	I’m taking this cake down to the church for the
	bake sale. Lyons was by to see you. He stopped by
	to pay you your twenty dollars. It’s laying in
	there on the table.
	TROY 
	Well... here go this money.
	ROSE 
	Put it in there on the table, Troy. I’ll get it.
	TROY 
	What time you coming back?
	ROSE 
	Ain’t no use in you studying me. It don’t matter
	what time I come back.
	TROY 
	I just asked you a question, woman. What’s the
	matter... can’t I ask you a question?
	ROSE 
	Troy, I don’t want to go into it.
	ROSE 
	Your dinner’s in there on the stove. All you got
	to do is heat it up. And don’t you be eating the
	rest of them cakes in there. I’m coming back for
	them. We having a bake sale at the church tomorrow.
	BONO 
	Hey, Troy.
	TROY 
	Hey, what’s happening, Bono?
	BONO 
	I just thought I’d stop by to see you. Wasn’t
	no one at the house, so I figured -
	TROY 
	What you stop by and see me for? You ain’t
	stopped by the house in a month of Sundays. Hell,
	I must owe you money or something.
	BONO 
	Since you got your promotion I can’t keep up
	with you. Used to see you every day. Now I don’t
	even know what route you working.
	TROY 
	They keep switching me around. Got me out in
	Greentree now... hauling white folks’ garbage.
	BONO 
	Greentree, huh? You lucky, at least you ain’t
	got to be lifting them barrels. Damn if they
	ain’t getting heavier. I’m gonna put in my two
	years and call it quits.
	TROY 
	I’m thinking about retiring myself.
	BONO 
	You got it easy. You can drive for another five
	years.
	TROY 
	It ain’t the same, Bono. It ain’t like working
	the back of the truck. Ain’t got nobody to talk
	to... feel like you working by yourself. Naw,
	I’m thinking about retiring.
	TROY 
	How’s Lucille?
	BONO 
	She all right. Her arthritis get to acting up
	on her sometime. Saw Rose on my way here. She going down to the church, huh?
	TROY 
	Yeah, she took up going down there. All them
	preachers looking for somebody to fatten their
	pockets.
	Got some gin here.
	BONO 
	Naw, thanks. I just stopped in to say hello.
	TROY 
	Hell, nigger... you can take a drink. I ain’t
	never known you to say no to a drink. You ain’t
	got to work tomorrow.
	BONO 
	I just stopped by. I’m fixing to go over to Skinner’s. We got us a domino game going over his
	house every Friday.
	TROY 
	Nigger, you can’t play no dominoes. I used to
	whup you four games out of five.
	BONO 
	Well, that learned me. I’m getting better.
	TROY 
	Yeah? Well, that’s all right.
	BONO 
	Look here... I got to be getting on.
	Troy nods as Bono slides down off the
	bar stool.
	BONO 
	Stop by sometime, huh?
	TROY 
	Yeah, I’ll do that, Bono.
	Bono slaps Troy on the back and starts
	to go.
	TROY
	Lucille told Rose you
	bought her a new refrigerator.
	BONO 
	Yeah, Rose told Lucille you had finally built
	your fence... so I figured we’d call it even.
	TROY 
	I knew you would.
	BONO 
	Yeah... okay. I’ll be talking to you.
	TROY 
	Yeah, take care, Bono. Good to see you. I’m
	gonna stop over.
	BONO 
	Yeah. Okay, Troy.
	Bono leaves. Troy downs the rest of
	his drink in one swallow. Under his
	breath, he starts to sing:
	TROY
	Hear it ring! Hear it ring!
	Had an old dog his name was Blue.
	TROY
	You know Blue was mighty true...
	You know Blue was a good old dog...
	TROY
	Blue treed a possum in a hollow log...
	You know from that he was a good old dog...
	TROY 
	Old Blue died and I dug his grave
	Let him down with a golden chain...
	TROY 
	Every night when I hear old Blue bark!
	Blue treed a possum in Noah’s Ark!
	CORY 
	I got to get by.
	TROY 
	Say what? What’s you say?
	CORY 
	You in my way. I got to get by.
	TROY 
	You got to get by where? This is my house.
	Bought and paid for. In full. Took me fifteen
	years. And if you wanna go in my house and I’m
	sitting on the steps... you say excuse me.
	Like your mama taught you.
	CORY 
	Come on, Pop... I got to get by.
	TROY 
	You just gonna walk over top of me?
	CORY 
	I live here too!
	TROY 
	You just gonna walk over top of me in my own
	house?
	CORY 
	I ain’t scared of you.
	TROY 
	I ain’t asked if you was scared of me. I asked
	you if you was fixing to walk over top of me in my
	own house? That’s the question. You ain’t gonna
	say excuse me? You just gonna walk over top of me?
	CORY 
	If you wanna put it like that.
	TROY 
	How else am I gonna put it?
	CORY 
	I was walking by you to go into the house ’cause
	you sitting on the steps drunk, singing to yourself. You can put it like that.
	TROY 
	Without saying excuse me???
	TROY 
	I asked you a question. Without saying excuse
	me???
	CORY 
	I ain’t got to say excuse me to you. You don’t
	count around here no more.
	TROY 
	Oh, I see... I don’t count around here no
	more. You ain’t got to say excuse me to your
	daddy. All of a sudden you done got so grown that
	your daddy don’t count around here no more...
	Around here in his own house and yard that he done
	paid for with the sweat of his brow. You done got
	so grown to where you gonna take over. You gonna
	take over my house. Is that right? You gonna wear
	my pants. You gonna go in there and stretch out
	on my bed. You ain’t got to say excuse me ’cause
	I don’t count around here no more. Is that right?
	CORY
	That’s right. You always talking
	this dumb stuff. Now, why don’t you just get out
	my way.
	TROY 
	I guess you got someplace to sleep and something
	to put in your belly. You got that, huh? You got
	that? That’s what you need. You got that, huh?
	CORY 
	You don’t know what I got. You ain’t got to
	worry about what I got.
	TROY 
	You right! You one hundred percent right! I done
	spent the last seventeen years worrying about
	what you got. Now it’s your turn, see? I’ll tell
	you what to do. You grown... we done established that. You a man. Now, let’s see you act
	like one. Turn your behind around and walk out
	this yard. And when you get out there in the alley... you can forget about this house. See?
	’Cause this is my house. You go on and be a man
	and get your own house. You can forget about
	this. ’Cause this is mine. You go on and get yours
	’cause I’m through with doing for you.
	CORY 
	You talking about what you did for me...
	what’d you ever give me?
	TROY 
	Them feet and bones! That pumping heart, nigger!
	I give you more than anybody else is ever gonna
	give you.
	CORY 
	You ain’t never gave me nothing! You ain’t never
	done nothing but hold me back. Afraid I was gonna
	be better than you. All you ever did was try and
	make me scared of you. I used to tremble every time
	you called my name. Every time I heard your footsteps in the house. Wondering all the time...
	what’s Papa gonna say if I do this?... What’s
	he gonna say if I do that?... What’s Papa gonna
	say if I turn on the radio? And Mama, too...
	she tries... but she’s scared of you.
	TROY 
	You leave your mama out of this. She ain’t got
	nothing to do with this.
	CORY 
	I don’t know how she stand you... after what
	you did to her.
	TROY 
	I told you to leave your mama out of this!
	CORY 
	What you gonna do... give me a whupping? You
	can’t whup me no more. You’re too old. You just
	an old man.
	TROY 
	Nigger! That’s what you are! You just another
	nigger on the street to me!
	CORY 
	You crazy! You know that?
	TROY 
	Go on now! You got the devil in you. Get on away
	from me!
	CORY 
	You just a crazy old man... talking about I
	got the devil in me.
	TROY 
	Yeah, I’m crazy! If you don’t get on the other
	side of that yard... I’m gonna show you how
	crazy I am! Go on... get the hell out of my yard.
	CORY 
	It ain’t your yard. You took Uncle Gabe’s money
	he got from the Army to buy this house and then
	you put him out.
	TROY 
	Get your black ass out of my yard!
	CORY 
	I ain’t going nowhere! Come on... put me out!
	I ain’t scared of you.
	TROY 
	That’s my bat!
	CORY 
	Come on!
	TROY 
	Put my bat down!
	CORY 
	Come on, put me out!
	CORY 
	What’s the matter? You so bad... Put me out!
	CORY
	Come on! Come on!
	TROY 
	You’re gonna have to use it! You wanna draw that
	bat back on me... you’re gonna have to use it.
	CORY 
	Come on!... Come on!
	TROY 
	You’re gonna have to kill me! You wanna draw
	that bat back on me. You’re gonna have to kill me.
	TROY 
	Come on! Come on!
	TROY 
	Then I’ll show you.
	TROY 
	Go on and get away from around my house.
	CORY 
	Tell Mama I’ll be back for my things.
	TROY
	They’ll be on the other side of
	that fence!
	TROY 
	I can’t taste nothing. Hallelujah!
	I can’t taste nothing no more.
	TROY 
	Come on! It’s between you and me now!
	TROY 
	Come on! Anytime you want! Come on! I be ready
	for you... but I ain’t gonna be easy.
	ROSE

	ROSE 
	What took you so long?
	CORY 
	You know how the Marines are, Mama. They got to
	get all their paperwork straight before they let
	you do anything.
	ROSE 
	Well, I’m sure glad you made it. They let Lyons
	come. Your Uncle Gabe’s still in the hospital.
	They don’t know if they gonna let him out or not.
	I just talked to them a little while ago.
	LYONS 
	A corporal in the United States Marines.
	BONO 
	Your daddy knew you had it in you. He used to
	tell me all the time.
	LYONS 
	Don’t he look good, Mr. Bono?
	BONO 
	Yeah, he remind me of Troy when I first met him.
	Say, Rose, Lucille’s down at the church with
	the choir. I’m gonna go down and get the pallbearers lined up. I’ll be back to get you all.
	ROSE 
	Thanks, Jim.
	CORY

	LYONS 
	Cory, look at Raynell. Ain’t she precious? She
	gonna break a whole lot of hearts.
	ROSE 
	Raynell, come and say hello to your brother.
	This is your brother, Cory. You remember Cory.

	you.
	ROSE

	ROSE
	Cory, You sure you don’t want nothing.

	CORY 
	No, Mama... thanks. I don’t feel like eating. I’ll get something later.
	ROSE 
	Raynell... get on upstairs and get that dress
	on like I told you.
	Raynell scrambles upstairs as Rose
	goes into the kitchen.
	LYON
	I always knew you was gonna make something out yourself. Your head was always in the
	right direction. So... you gonna stay in...
	make it a career... put in your twenty years?
	CORY 
	I don’t know. I got six already, I think that’s
	enough.
	LYONS 
	Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early. Ain’t nothing out here. I guess Rose told you what happened
	with me. They got me down the workhouse. I thought
	I was being slick cashing other people’s checks.
	CORY 
	How much time you doing?
	LYONS 
	They give me three years. I got that beat now.
	I ain’t got but nine more months. It ain’t so bad.
	You learn to deal with it like anything else. You
	got to take the crookeds with the straights.
	That’s what Papa used to say. He used to say that
	when he struck out. I seen him strike out three
	times in a row... and the next time up he hit
	the ball over the grandstand. Right out there in
	Homestead Field. He wasn’t satisfied hitting in
	the seats... he wanted to hit it over everything! After the game he had two hundred people
	standing around waiting to shake his hand. You
	got to take the crookeds with the straights.
	Yeah, Papa was something else.
	CORY 
	You still playing?
	LYONS 
	Cory... you know I’m gonna do that. There’s
	some fellows down there we got us a band... we
	gonna try and stay together when we get out...
	but yeah, I’m still playing.
	ROSE 
	Lyons, I got these eggs in the pan.
	LYONS 
	Let me go on and get these eggs, man. Get ready
	to go bury Papa.
	How you doing? You doing all right?
	RAYNELL 
	Hi.
	CORY 
	Hi.
	RAYNELL 
	Did you used to sleep in my room?
	CORY 
	Yeah... that used to be my room.
	RAYNELL 
	That’s what Papa call it. “Cory’s room.” It
	got your football in the closet.
	ROSE 
	Raynell, get in there and get them good shoes
	on!
	RAYNELL 
	Mama, can’t I wear these? Them other one hurt
	my feet.
	ROSE 
	Well, they just gonna have to hurt your feet for
	a while. You ain’t said they hurt your feet when
	you went down to the store and got them.
	RAYNELL 
	They didn’t hurt then. My feet done got bigger.
	ROSE 
	Don’t you give me no back talk now. You get in
	there and get them shoes on.
	ROSE
	Ain’t too much changed.
	He still got that piece of rag tied to that tree.
	He was out here swinging that bat. I was just
	ready to go back in the house. He swung that bat
	and then he just fell over. Seem like he swung
	it and stood there with this grin on his
	face... and then he just fell over. They carried him on down to the hospital but I knew there
	wasn’t no need... why don’t you come on in
	the house.
	CORY 
	Mama... I got something to tell you. I don’t
	know how to tell you this... but I’ve got to
	tell you... I’m not going to Papa’s funeral.
	ROSE 
	Boy, hush your mouth. That’s your daddy you
	talking about. I don’t want hear that kind of talk
	this morning. I done raised you to come to this?
	You standing there all healthy and grown talking
	about you ain’t going to your daddy’s funeral?
	CORY 
	Mama... listen...
	ROSE 
	I don’t want to hear it, Cory. You just get that
	thought out of your head.
	CORY 
	I’ve got to say no to him. One time in my life
	I’ve got to say no.
	ROSE 
	Don’t nobody have to listen to nothing like
	that. I know you and your daddy ain’t seen eye to
	eye, but I ain’t gotta listen to that kind of talk
	this morning. Disrespecting your daddy ain’t
	gonna make you a man, Cory. You got to find a way
	to come to that on your own. Not going to your
	daddy’s funeral ain’t gonna make you a man.
	CORY 
	The whole time I was growing up... living in
	his house... Papa was like a shadow that followed you everywhere. It weighed on you and sunk
	into your flesh. It would wrap around you and lay
	there until you couldn’t tell which one was you
	anymore. That shadow digging in your flesh. Trying
	to crawl in. Trying to live through you. I’m just
	saying I’ve got to find a way to get rid of that
	shadow, Mama.
	ROSE 
	You just like him. You got him in you good.
	CORY 
	Don’t tell me that, Mama.
	ROSE 
	You Troy Maxson all over again.
	CORY 
	I don’t want to be Troy Maxson. I want to be me.
	ROSE 
	You can’t be nobody but who you are, Cory. That
	shadow wasn’t nothing but you growing into yourself. You either got to grow into it or cut it
	down to fit you. But that’s all you got to make
	life with. That’s all you got to measure yourself
	against that world out there. Your daddy wanted
	you to be everything he wasn’t... and at the
	same time he tried to make you into everything he
	was. I don’t know if he was right or wrong...
	but I do know he meant to do more good than he
	meant to do harm.
	ROSE 
	Sometimes when he touched he bruised. And sometimes when he took me in his arms he cut.
	When I first met your daddy I thought, “Here is
	a man I can lay down with and make a baby.” That’s
	the first thing I thought when I seen him...
	“Rose Lee, here is a man that you can open yourself up to and be filled to bursting. Here is a man
	that can fill all them empty spaces you been tipping around the edges of.”
	When your daddy walked through the house he was
	so big he filled it up. That was my first mistake.
	Not to make him leave some room for me. But I
	wanted a house that I could sing in, and that’s
	what your daddy gave me. I didn’t know to keep up
	his strength I had to give up little pieces of
	mine. I took on his life as mine and mixed up the
	pieces so that you couldn’t hardly tell which was
	which anymore. It was my choice. It was my life and
	I didn’t have to live it like that. But that’s what
	life offered me in the way of being a woman and I
	took it. I grabbed hold of it with both hands. By
	the time Raynell came into the house... I didn’t
	want to make my blessing off of nobody’s misfortune, but I took on to Raynell like she was all
	them babies I had wanted and never had.
	ROSE 
	Like I’d been blessed to relive a part of my
	life. And if the Lord see fit to keep up my
	strength... I’m gonna do her just like your
	daddy did you... I’m gonna give her the best
	of what’s in me.
	RAYNELL 
	Mama... Reverend Tolliver on the phone.
	RAYNELL 
	Hi.
	CORY 
	Hi.
	RAYNELL 
	You in the Army or the Marines?
	CORY 
	Marines.
	RAYNELL 
	Papa said it was the Army. Did you know Blue?
	CORY 
	Blue? Who’s Blue?
	RAYNELL 
	Papa’s dog what he sing about all the time.
	CORY
	Hear it ring! Hear it ring!
	I had a dog his name was Blue
	You know Blue was mighty true
	You know Blue was a good old dog
	Blue treed a possum in a hollow log
	You know from that he was a good old dog.
	Hear it ring!
	Raynell, embarrassed, delighted, joins
	in.
	CORY AND RAYNELL 
	Blue treed a possum out on a limb
	Blue looked at me and I looked at him
	Grabbed that possum and put him in a sack
	Blue stayed there till I came back
	Old Blue’s feets was big and round
	Never allowed a possum to touch the ground.
	Old Blue died and I dug his grave
	I dug his grave with a silver spade
	Let him down with a golden chain
	And every night I call his name
	Go on Blue, you good dog you
	Go on Blue, you good dog you
	RAYNELL 
	Blue laid down and died like a man
	Blue laid down and died...
	CORY
	Blue laid down and died like a man
	Now he’s treeing possums in the Promised Land.
	CORY AND RAYNELL 
	I’m gonna tell you this to let you
	know...
	Blue’s gone where the good dogs go.
	Rose comes to the door.
	ROSE 
	Cory, we gonna be ready to go in a minute.
	CORY
	You go on in the house and change
	them shoes like Mama told you so we can go to Papa’s funeral.
	RAYNELL 
	Okay, I’ll be back.
	Raynell hurries into the house. Cory gets up,
	crosses over to the tree. Rose stands at the screen
	door watching him. She takes a look at the threatening sky, about to return to the house, when she
	sees Gabriel. He’s older but healthier, more vital, in a new suit and a hat. One arm is behind
	his back. Rose is speechless with surprise.
	GABRIEL 
	Hey, Rose!
	ROSE 
	Gabe?
	GABRIEL 
	I’m here, Rose. Hey Rose, I’m here.
	ROSE 
	Lord...
	Look here, Lyons!
	LYONS 
	See, I told you, Rose... I told you they’d
	let him come.
	CORY 
	How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
	LYONS 
	How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
	GABRIEL 
	Hey, Rose. It’s time. It’s time to tell Saint
	Peter to open the Gates.
	GABRIEL 
	Troy, you ready?
	GABRIEL 
	You ready, Troy. I’m gonna tell Saint Peter
	to open the Gates. You get ready now.
	GABRIEL 
	That’s the way that go!
