	JEFF
	That’s very close, by the way...
	LAVONA
	This is my little man. You my
	little man? (Then to camera) That’s
	my 6th husband right there. The
	best of them!
	LAVONA (V.O.)
	Tonya’s my 5th child from husband
	number 4. She was always a handful
	but I loved her and I guess we
	spoiled her. Which is a goddamned
	hat trick when you haven’t got shit
	your entire life. Still.
	I drove her to competitions and
	practices. I sewed her all her
	costumes.
	LAVONA
	But to her, her mother’s a monster.
	DIANE
	Generally people either love Tonya
	or are not big fans. Like people
	either love America or are not big
	fans. Tonya was totally American.
	SHAWN (V.O.)
	Originally Jeff and Tonya wanted to
	take out Nancy Kerrigan. Take her
	out. I popped up and said there’s
	other ways to disable people. So.
	You’re welcome.
	MARTIN MADDOX
	I was a reporter for Hard Copy, a
	crappy show all the ‘legitimate’
	news outlets looked down on- then
	became.
	JEFF
	At 27 I was the most hated man in
	America. Maybe the world- with a
	moustache I still can’t apologize
	enough for. My name was a verb.
	Like, if you bash someone in the
	kneecap, you ‘Gillooly’ them...
	That was cool though.
	TONYA
	What’s people’s impression of me?
	That I’m a real person. That I
	didn’ ever apologize for growin’ up
	poor or bein’ a red neck which is
	what I am. In a sport where the
	friggin’ judges want you to be this
	old-timey version of what a woman’s
	supposed to be. Um. For bein’ the
	first U.S. woman to land a triple
	axel. So fuck ‘em.
	LAVONA
	Diane! Lavona Harding. I spoke with
	you on the phone.
	DIANE
	Mrs. Harding
	LAVONA
	Lavona. It’s Lavona
	DIANE
	Sorry. There’s no smoking on the ice.
	LAVONA
	Oh... I’ll smoke it quietly then. This
	here’s my daughter Tonya.
	DIANE
	Mrs. Harding. I told you onLAVONA
	I know what you told me. And it’s
	Lavona. Only you never seen her skate.
	DIANE
	I don’t train beginners.
	LAVONA
	All she does is talk about skating.
	All day, all night. I can’t make
	her shut up about it. So it’s
	easier puttin’ her on ice if you
	know what I mean. We figure with
	the right training she can make the
	most of her gift. Like Ice Capades
	maybe one day or something.
	DIANE
	How old are you, honey?
	LAVONA
	She’s a soft 4.
	DIANE
	She’s a very pretty girl but I don’t
	take on students this young. I’m
	sorry. I have a class waiting.
	LAVONA
	Go on. Skate.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	6 months later I win my first
	competition. I was 4. Those bitches
	didn’t know what hit ‘em.
	LAVONA
	Wrooooong!.. Ordinary. Nothing special
	there.
	Are you even trying. Cause there’s
	other places I’d fucking rather be...
	Concentrate. Is that what you call a
	clean skate, for Christ sake?
	SKATER MOM
	Could you not swear in front of the
	kids please, Lavona?
	LAVONA
	I didn’t swear, you cunt. Stop talking to
	her! That girl is your enemy. You’re
	not here to make friends.
	Where the hell are you going?
	TONYA
	I have to go to the bathroom.
	LAVONA
	Don’t tell me what you have to do. I
	paid for you to skate. You’re gonna
	stay on the ice and skate.
	Get over here.
	You’ll have to come off the ice
	sometime. Ya hear me? I’ll be right
	here waiting.
	Skate wet.
	LAVONA
	To hear her tell it, I would operate
	on her daily without anaesthesia. One
	fuckin’ time. I hit her one time, with
	a hairbrush.
	LAVONA
	Fucking terrible, scum sucking, loser!
	LAVONA (V.O.)
	A child sometimes wants to be
	corrected.
	LAVONA
	Answer me when I talk to you.
	LAVONA
	When I felt this, I gave her
	criticism.
	LAVONA
	The thing about Tonya was, she skated
	better when she was enraged. If there
	was no “You can’t do it” type of
	thing, she wouldn’t do it.
	On the ice, I was there to inspire
	her. Off the ice she was a happy, well
	adjusted girl.
	TONYA
	Dang!
	AL
	It was a clean shot, Tonnie.
	TONYA
	I know it. I was aiming for her eyes
	like you said. Otherwise I coulda got
	her probably.
	AL
	No sense in shooting a bunny if you
	shoot half the meat off her.
	TONYA
	When I get older I’m gonna work in an
	office and have a deadline.
	AL
	I thought you wanted to do Ice
	Capades.
	TONYA
	I can do both. Yesterday mom made me
	wear my skating costume to school. The
	red one with the tassels. Everyone
	made fun of me.
	AL
	Why’d she do that?
	TONYA
	Cause they were taking school pictures
	and she said we could use the samples
	for competitions. I told mom that
	Margie Sussman called us white trash
	and mom told me -
	LAVONA
	Spit in her milk!!
	AL
	I hope you didn’t do that.
	TONYA
	Not yet...
	Do you love her?
	AL
	I guess. Do you?
	TONYA
	...Yeah.
	AL
	Like you love me?
	TONYA
	Nope.
	LAVONA
	What does she need a fucking fur coat
	for? I don’t have a fucking fur coat.
	DIANE
	Because it’s not just skating. The
	judges want figure skaters to beLAVONA
	Rich, prissy, a-holes9.
	DIANE
	Well rounded. It’s a question of
	fitting in.
	LAVONA
	She’s 12 and she lands fucking
	triples. She doesn’t fit in. She
	stands out.
	DIANE
	She stands out because she looks like
	she chops wood every morning.
	LAVONA
	She does chop wood every..?
	DIANE
	Lavona. You want to work with me a
	little? 23 skaters I train so I can
	coach Tonya full time.
	LAVONA
	And I waitress full time to pay for
	your coaching.
	DIANE
	Yes, but she’s not my child.
	LAVONA
	No she’s mine. And I’m not throwing my
	money away so she can fit in with
	these little shits. You can dress up a
	pig however you want, ya know what I’m
	saying?
	DIANE
	It’s not about fitting in. It’s about
	how she’s growing up.
	LAVONA
	Lick my ass, Diane. She can do a
	fucking triple.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	We didn’t have a lotta fun. We never
	went to Disneyland or on trips.
	If I wanted something, I hada come up
	with a way to get it.
	SNOOTY GIRL
	What kind of a coat is that?
	LAVONA
	Go on! Get out! I thought you’d never
	leave!
	TONYA
	I’m sorry.
	AL
	It’s not your fault, Tonnie.
	TONYA
	Then take me with you.
	AL
	I’m gonna be working 12 hour night
	shifts. I can’t look after you.
	TONYA
	You could if you want to.
	AL
	We’ll talk on the phone. It’ll all
	work out.
	You gotta move now, honey.
	Tonnie, please.
	TONYA
	You’re not gonna leave me here...
	Dad..?
	Take me with you!!
	TONYA
	You’re. In. My. Way.
	JEFF
	Who’s that?
	TONYA
	We met in an ice rink where I was
	practicing. I was 15. I was there 8
	hours a day, skating. I don’t know
	what he was doing there.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	I was young. And I had no game
	whatsoever.
	JEFF
	So... do you like food?
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Back then my step-brother Creepy Chris
	was living with us. I remember Jeff
	and my’s first date cause I had Creepy
	Chris arrested earlier that day.
	SHAWN
	Jeff did consult me regarding
	Tonya. He asked me what I thought
	and I said, ‘Go for it man.’ Not to
	be a bragger or anything but if I
	told Jeff, “You could do better,
	man’ no one would be talking about
	them today.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	I’ve never been a girly girl. Jeff
	was my first date ever... And my
	mom came.
	LAVONA
	You a gardener or a flower, John?
	JEFF
	Jeff.
	LAVONA
	In a relationship there’s a flower and
	there’s a gardener.
	TONYA
	Mom
	JEFF
	Um, I don’t know. I never thought
	LAVONA
	I’m a gardener who wants to be a
	flower. How fucked am I?
	She downs a drink.
	Tonya won’t garden to save her life.
	You’re gonna have to do all the
	gardening there fella.
	TONYA
	Mom!
	LAVONA
	What??
	You two fuck yet?
	TONYA
	My dad’s only been laid off a couple
	months now so he stopped sending
	money. We had plenty of money before.
	I have a fur coat and everything.
	JEFF
	Yeah?
	TONYA
	Otherwise
	JEFF
	My family’s poor.
	TONYA
	You need me to disconnect the plugs
	before you
	JEFF
	Kay.
	She moves closer as they work. Jeff hands her a towel.
	TONYA
	That’s okay.
	What’cha gonna do now school’s done?
	JEFF
	I do this job for the Association For
	Retarded Persons. I mean, I’m not a
	retarded person. I’m their driver.
	Which is cool. My dad was Air Force.
	He died when I was young so my college
	is paid for. But- I dunno.
	TONYA
	My parents had me quit school. To
	concentrate on skating.
	JEFF
	It’s like your superpower. It’s
	fucking awesome what you can do.
	TONYA
	So, what? You like me?
	JEFF
	You are so fuckin’ pretty.
	TONYA
	No, I’m not!You are.
	Under the open, greasy hood of his truck, they kiss.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	He was really sweet in the
	beginning. He was a good kisser. He
	told me he loved me. And I believed
	him. But then
	TONYA
	He started hitting me a few months in.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Then he’d say it’d never happen again.
	But I figured
	TONYA
	My mom hits me. She loves me.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	That’s just what I knew.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	He’d say he was sorry. And things
	would be normal for a while
	JEFF
	I’m sorry.
	TONYA
	I know.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	He was the first boy I ever loved.
	TONYA
	He’d beat the living hell outta me.
	TONYA
	And I thought it was my fault. Look
	Nancy gets hit one time
	TONYA
	... and the whole world shits. For me
	it was an all the time occurrence.
	JEFF
	I never hit her. That’s not me. I’m
	actually a pretty meek guy.
	She hit me though. And she
	packed a wallop!
	JEFF (V.O.)
	Fired a gun at me too.
	TONYA
	This is bullshit. I never did this.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	That comes later. We’re still happy
	now.
	LAVONA
	I can see that shiner through your
	make up, ya know.
	TONYA
	I fell on the ice yesterday.
	LAVONA
	I don’t know, Tonnie. I would never be
	with someone who fuckin’ hit me.
	TONYA
	You hit dad.
	LAVONA
	That’s different.
	TONYA
	Anyway he said he was sorry.
	LAVONA
	Seriously though. You’re a dumb piece
	of shit who thinks she deserves to get
	hit.
	TONYA
	How’d I get that idea?
	LAVONA
	Maybe he should hit you. Maybe you’ll
	learn to keep your big mouth shut.
	Sure helps me out.
	I’m supportive of this relationship,
	do you hear me?
	TONYA
	I gotta go to practice.
	LAVONA
	Hey!!
	Kiss your mother goodbye.
	TONYA
	They freakin’ hate me. Emily Ann fell
	and scored higher.
	DIANE
	Honey, you’re- different.
	TONYA
	I’m not dressing like a retarded tooth
	fairy. This is bullshit.
	DIANE
	The judges expect a conventionalTONYA
	I don’t want to be conventional!
	DIANE
	And your scores reflect that.
	TONYA
	If I did a triple they’d have to give
	me my fucking scores.
	DIANE
	You can’t just do the tripleTONYA
	Sometimes I can!
	TONYA
	It wasn’t my fault.
	LAVONA
	Nothing’s ever your fault.
	TONYA
	I out-skated
	LAVONA
	You skated like a graceless bull dyke!
	I was embarrassed for you.
	TONYA
	I’m sorry.
	LAVONA
	Your father’s not paying alimony ya
	know. Every penny I make - every penny
	- goes to your skating. And you
	weren’t even fucking trying.
	TONYA
	I said I was sorry.
	LAVONA
	Don’t talk back to me.
	TONYA
	Saying I’m sorry’s not talkin back!
	LAVONA
	That supposed to be smart?!
	You fucking ungrateful
	TONYA
	Stop it!!
	LAVONA
	Rolling your fucking alien eyes at me
	when I’m talking!
	TONYA
	I didn’t!
	21.
	LAVONA
	You think I like working for you, you
	selfish bitch? If you’re sleeping with
	that mustache I want you to start
	paying rent.
	TONYA
	You’re crazy!
	LAVONA
	I’m not paying for you to act like a
	whore and live off me for free!
	TONYA
	Bat shit fuckin’ crazy!
	LAVONA (CONT'D)
	Ugly fuckin’ whore!
	LAVONA
	Oh, please! Show me a family that
	doesn’t have ups and downs...
	JEFF
	Tonya needed to get away from her mom
	so we got a place together.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	There wasn’t no more talk of air force
	or college. I didn’t care. I wanted to
	take care of her. To protect her.
	TONYA
	Think it needs more tulle? I want it
	to look pretty. Tulle’s classy right?
	JEFF
	You think any more bout getting your
	high school G.E.D.?
	TONYA
	I don’t give a red hot shit about that
	anymore.
	JEFF
	I think you should look into it.
	TONYA
	Maybe a bow in back?... What if I’m
	not smart enough?
	JEFF
	I ever tell you what I was most afraid
	of growing up? Ohmys.
	TONYA
	Ohmys?
	JEFF
	You know in The Wizard Of Oz when they
	say, ‘Lions and tigers and bears! Oh
	my? My brother convinced me Ohmys were
	gonna come in the middle of the night
	and eat me alive.
	TONYA
	You were so freakin’ dumb.
	JEFF
	And I got a high school diploma.
	23.
	Well, you’re gonna get a medal for
	your sewin’ alone.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	Looking back, that was probably our
	happiest time. I’d make peanut butter
	sandwiches and she’s go off to
	competitions. We had exactly the same
	interests.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	We both liked trucks. And fixing cars
	up. So. I thought it would last
	forever!
	TONYA
	This is fucking wrong, Diane.
	DIANE
	Tonya!
	TONYA
	Hey! How do I get a fair shot here?
	I’m up at 5 every morning working my
	ass off. Does someone wanna tell me to
	my face you’re never giving me scores
	I deserve?
	JUDGE
	This is how it’s done. Some of these
	girls have paid their dues
	TONYA
	I don’t give a shit! I out-skated em
	today
	JUDGE
	We also judge on presentation.
	TONYA
	Well you know what? If you can come up
	with $5000 for a costume for me then I
	won’t have to make one. But until
	then, stay out of my face.
	JUDGE
	Maybe you’re just not as good as you
	think. Maybe you need to pick another
	sport.
	TONYA
	Suck my dick! This is fuckin’ rigged!
	DIANE
	Do you really think your scores will
	improve now that you told them to
	If you
	dressed appropriately maybe they’d
	score you appropriately.
	TONYA
	I dressed pretty! God, you don’t like
	the way I dress or talk or any of my
	music. It’s like you want me to be an
	entirely different person!
	DIANE
	I want you to be a better competitor
	or I’m wasting my time.
	TONYA
	Well then you’re wasting your time!
	Cause you know what? Doddie Teachman
	wants to be my coach anyways! You’re
	fucking fired, Diane!
	TONYA
	That wasn’t my fault. Unless puberty
	is my fault.
	SHAWN
	To be fair, Jeff did love her. He
	really loved her. I remember one
	time he took her to a Richard Marks
	concert. That’s when I knew shit
	was serious.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	You do dumb things when you’re young.
	Like marrying Jeff.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	The wedding was nice. It made sense at
	the time. I could have insurance. Good
	benefits all around. He had a car.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Plus I was doing 6 hours a day of
	practice while I worked a drill press,
	I did welding, I ran a fork lift. But
	now, now I could just skate like all
	those other girls.
	LAVONA
	I don’t know what to tell you.
	Marrying the first idiot who said
	you’re pretty. You fuck dumb. You
	don’t marry dumb.
	MARTIN MADDOX
	Most people don’t understand how
	insanely difficult it is to even
	attempt a triple axel. There’s a
	reason no one was trying it.
	DIANE
	You skate backward then take off
	from a forward position on your
	left leg and somehow
	LAVONA
	-fuckin’ hurl yourself blindly for
	3 1/2 rotations like you’re light
	as shit which I’m telling you Tonya
	never was
	DIANE
	-landing on the opposite foot on
	the back outside edge of that razor
	thin blade.
	JEFF
	It’s that extra half rotation when
	you already did 3 that made us call
	Tonya the Charles Barkley of
	skating. It was bad ass.
	TONYA
	I don’t know if I can do this, Doddie.
	I missed it in my last training.
	DODDIE
	Of course you can. You got this.
	SPECTATOR
	You suck, Tonya.
	What is this? Rednecks On Ice?
	The Lice Capades!
	DODDIE
	No woman in the history of U.S. Figure
	skating has landed a triple axel. All
	those women who came before you. Not 1
	of them did it.
	The skating association doesn’t think
	you can do it. ‘Trashy Tonya’ doesn’t
	belong. Your own mother doesn’t think
	so. Now show them.
	TV ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
	Here now is Tonya Harding. Second
	after the original program. Just 20
	years old from Portland Oregon. Great
	power. Great speed. Great athletic
	ability.
	TV ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
	And now the question is- whether 3
	moves into the program she will do
	a triple axle. First a triple Lutz
	TV ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
	And now we will find out- will she
	become the 1st American woman to
	attempt and complete a triple axel
	jump.
	TV ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
	We’ll know here whether she tries or
	not
	TV ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
	Good girl!!! Isn’t that great!
	SLOW MOTION: the realization of what she’s done hits her. She
	looks doubtful, stunned, thrilled, disbelieving, elated.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	It was totally the most awesomest
	thing. Cause leading up it you’re
	like, ‘”I can’t do it! I can’t. I
	can’t.’ BAM! I CAN! All those people
	who said I couldn’t make it. Well fuck
	you I did! I proved everyone wrong.
	TV ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
	Oh!... Oh!
	TONYA
	I was loved.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	I can’t describe how that felt.
	There was people standing up. For
	the first time, I knew.
	TONYA
	I knew I was the best figure skater in
	the world. At one point in time.
	I’m sorry. Nobody ever asks me about
	this anymore.
	JEFF
	I was blind-sided. As soon as she got
	back from Nationals she was an
	entirely different person. And that
	person didn’t want old Jeff no more.
	TONYA
	Where the fuck are my Dove Bars?
	JEFF
	We can’t afford em. Eskimo Pie is just
	as good.
	TONYA
	I’m America’s best figure skater! I
	don’t want friggin’ Eskimo Pies.
	When was the last time you even
	showered? I want a friggin’ Dove Bar!
	JEFF
	After the triple everything
	changed.
	TONYA
	After the triple everything
	changed.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	The Jeff I fell in love with was gone.
	If I got up in the morning, I got hit.
	If I took a shit, I got hit. He didn’t
	need a reason anymore is what I’m
	saying. I just had enough. My whole
	entire life I been told I wouldn’t
	amount to anything. Well. Maybe I
	would.
	MARTIN MADDOX (V.O.)
	Suddenly Kristi & Nancy were 2nd & 78A
	3rd. Then Tonya was 2nd at World
	Championships & won Skate America.
	TONYA
	And fuck him! I’m skating better
	than ever!
	MARTIN MADDOX
	In the skating community the feeling
	was like, “Oh my God. Oh shit! This is
	our skating champion?”
	MARTIN MADDOX (V.O.)
	Tonya did the triple. No one else
	could or even had the balls to try.
	MARTIN MADDOX
	Tonya Harding wasn’t the image
	TONYA
	Could I interrupt with a quick word
	about Nancy Kerrigan? It’ll just take
	a sec.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Nancy and I were friends. We were
	roommates sometimes on the road.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	But the press wanted her to be the
	princess and me to be the pile of
	crap. To sell papers!
	TONYA
	What kind of friggin person would bash
	in their friend’s knee?... Who would
	do that to a friend?...
	SHAWN
	This is bullshit! You gave her
	everything and this is how she treats
	you? Tell her that!
	JEFF
	Why are you such a bitch? You’re
	acting completely different fromTONYA (O.S.)
	I am different! Everything’s
	different. People smile at me now.
	SHAWN
	What she saying? What she saying?
	JEFF
	People smile at her now.
	SHAWN
	Oh, man!!
	JEFF
	How could you file a restraining order
	on me?
	JEFF (V.O.)
	They showed up at work in front of
	everybody and-!
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Yeah, I filed a restraining order
	so I wouldn’t have to look at your
	face!
	JEFF
	She hung up!
	SHAWN
	No she didn’t!
	JEFF
	I’m calling her back!
	SHAWN
	Call her back!
	JEFF
	Mrs. Eckardt? Do you mind dialing
	that number again?
	The phone cord goes all the way up the stairs.
	SHAWN’S MOTHER
	Okey dokey!
	TONYA (O.S.)
	Fuck you!!
	SHAWN
	What she say?
	JEFF
	Just one more time, Mrs. Eckhardt!
	TONYA (V.O.)
	I said, fuck you!!
	JEFF
	Don’t
	We’re going to Sun Valley. Lets go.
	He’s out the door. Shawn follows.
	SHAWN
	You’re not gonna let her have the last
	word, man?
	JEFF
	No way!
	SHAWN
	None of my women get the last word!
	JEFF
	I’m going to Sun Valley! She’ll be
	there for a competition. I’m getting
	the last word! I’m the man!
	SHAWN
	Whoo! We're the man!!
	SHAWN
	Jeff. I have been a co op specialist
	in Switzerland AND Europe. Hostage
	retrieval is my area of expertise.
	SHAWN
	I’m telling you. We’re in, we’re out.
	Mind control may be necessary. Which
	I’ve been practicing in Kenya, Korea
	SHAWN
	When traveling internationally I’m
	resourceful as a lizard. My skills
	have been honed by years of
	infiltrating underground
	organizations.
	SHAWN
	We blend. We disappear. Under no
	circumstances do we create a scene.
	JEFF
	Tonya!!
	No. Fuck you!
	JEFF AND SHAWN
	Whooo!!!!!!
	TONYA
	The truth is I liked being married.
	Just not to him.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	He was calling all the time saying
	“I’ve been to therapy. I love you. We
	belong together. Take me back.’
	TONYA (V.O.)
	I wanted to be loved. And I hoped it
	would work. So I went back.
	TONYA
	The second Jeff came back ..everything went to shit.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	The closer the Olympics got the worse
	my skating got.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	It was like a nightmare. Or a freaking
	curse.
	TONYA
	But I still believed- I knew I was
	gonna do it. I would be the first and
	only woman to do the triple in the
	Olympics. My whole life was leading to
	this one moment!
	DODDIE
	Visualize the triple when you’re in
	the lay back. This is everything
	you’ve been working for.
	TONYA
	I fuckin’ got it, Doddie.
	ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
	She was 1st in the United States in
	1991. She was 2nd in the world in
	1991. 3rd in Nationals in Orlando. She
	arrived late for these games & missed
	the opening ceremony entirely. Here is
	Tonya Harding.
	ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
	Her opening move, a lay back spin is
	unique because you’re dizzy from the
	spins. And her next jump, the triple
	axel, is the most difficult jump being
	performed in the ladies event.
	ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
	And this is so exciting. No woman has
	attempted and completed a triple axel
	in Olympic competition.
	ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
	Tonya Harding could make olympic
	history. Right... here
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Soooo- I’d broken off my skate
	blade 2 days before in practice.
	They put it back on a little off so
	All my landings were off. All of
	them. I mean, that wasn’t my fault.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	So, I came in 4th behind Nancy. I was
	really happy with that! It was
	awesome. Except it fucking wasn’t
	fair.
	JEFF
	This next part. I mean... Not true.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Things got out of hand. We couldn’t be
	in the same house together. I called
	the authorities on him the whole
	summer. Filed restraining orders.
	Finally I divorced him.
	JEFF
	Missing something?
	Tonya I’ve got your bag. Open the
	door. Can I not drop something off?
	TONYA
	Jeff you can’t be here. You can’t
	be within a hundred feet of me. I’m
	calling the cops.
	JEFF
	I am gonna break your fucking legs!
	I’m gonna fucking kill you! Do you
	want me to kill you? Do you want me to
	kill myself?
	TONYA
	Put down the fucking gun. Stop it!
	JEFF
	Which is it, bitch? What’d ya want?
	He puts the gun right in her face.
	I’ll fucking kill you. You don’t need
	your purse. You don’t need anything.
	You need me! Okay?
	TONYA
	Okay... Okay. Put down the fucking
	gun. Just put down the fucking gun.
	JEFF
	Get back! Stand back! Everything’s
	fine!
	JEFF
	You fucking bitch! Look what you did!
	Look what you made me do!
	I will kill you if you say anything!
	Shit!
	POLICEMAN
	I’m going to need you to get out of
	the car.
	121 INT/EXT. JEFF’S TRUCK - ROADSIDE - LATER 121
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Didn’t say a thing about the blood!
	Took alcohol and 2 guns outta the
	truck! Then he just leaves me there
	with him which is why I don’t trust
	the authorities. Or anyone.
	Jeff can talk his way out
	of anything. Never talk to him.
	LAVONA
	Well my story line is disappearing
	right now. What. The. Fuck.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	When you come in 4th in the
	Olympics you don’t get endorsement
	deals. You get the 6 a.m. shift at
	DIANE
	You look well.
	TONYA
	I look like someone who had a way
	outta this shit and fucked it up.
	DIANE
	I was being polite.
	You okay?
	TONYA
	Well. My skating career’s over. I have
	no savings. I ended up a waitress like
	my mom. On the plus side I’m
	unskilled.
	DIANE
	The Olympic committee announced today
	the next Olympics are going to be in 2
	years instead of 4.
	No heavy metal. Lose the blue nail
	polish.
	TONYA
	I’m too outta shape.
	DIANE
	Pear is a shape. The
	world’s giving you a 2nd chance. I
	know you don’t believe in them but I
	do.
	TONYA
	This is how Rocky trained when he had
	to fight the Russian. And it worked!
	DIANE
	She actually did this.
	DIANE
	And this.
	DIANE
	And this.
	TONYA
	Sir? Excuse me. Can we talk a minute
	about my score?
	JUDGE
	Happy to.
	TONYA
	I know you don’t like me. But I’m
	landing all my jumps out there.
	JUDGE
	Tonya... It’s never been entirely
	about skating. I’ll deny I ever said
	it honey, but you’re just not the
	image we want to portray. You’re
	representing our country, for goodness
	sake. We need to see a wholesome
	American family. And you refuse to
	play the along.
	TONYA
	I don’t have a wholesome American
	family. Why can’t it just be about
	skating?
	TONYA (V.O.)
	They want a wholesome American
	family? It’s not gonna be easy. But
	I could pull that outta my ass.
	LAVONA
	Shit. I know you don’t expect me to
	wait on you.
	TONYA
	I don’t expect a thing, mom.
	LAVONA
	Well aren’t you a little hot house
	flower.
	TONYA
	I’m training for the Olympics anyhow.
	LAVONA
	So what do you want from me? Money?
	TONYA
	God. I just wanted to see you.
	LAVONA
	You’re a taker. Every cent I made went
	to your skating and you took it. What
	do you want?
	TONYA
	Well this was a stupid fucking idea.
	Was anything I ever did good enough
	for you?
	LAVONA
	You were soft.
	TONYA
	At 3??
	LAVONA
	And I made you a fighter. You never48.
	TONYA
	You made me think I skate best when my
	life is shit. And now my life is shit.
	You made that true. I don’t want thatLAVONA
	You woulda picked it in a heartbeat!
	You should be thanking me. Not blaming
	me.
	TONYA
	Did you ever love me? Or anything
	even?
	LAVONA
	You think Sonja Henie’s mother loved
	her? Poor fuckin’ you. I didn’t stay
	home making Apple Brown Bettys. No I
	made you champion! Knowing you’d hate
	me for it. That’s the sacrifice a
	mother makes. I wish I had a mother
	like me. Instead of nice. Nice gets
	you shit. I didn’t like my mother
	either. So what? I gave you a gift.
	TONYA
	You cursed me. You’re a monster.
	LAVONA
	Spilled milk, baby.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	I was pretty surprised when Tonya
	called me. But she said
	TONYA
	I don’t think I can make it
	to the Olympics without you.
	TONYA
	I don’t think I can make it
	to the Olympics without you.
	JEFF
	I admit it. A part of me still thought
	the sun rose and set with her. I just
	wanted her to look at me like she used
	to. I just wanted to hold on.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	I figured it was just for 3 weeks. The
	second I made the team I was gonna
	dump his ass. But...
	TONYA
	Before I could think too much on that,
	I mean, it’s what you all came for
	folks! THE FUCKING INCIDENT.
	MARTIN MADDOX
	The incident!
	DIANE
	The incident...
	LAVONA
	The fucking incident!
	JEFF
	Everyone remembers the incident
	differently and that’s a fact.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	Some people honest to god remember
	Tonya whacking Nancy herself.
	JEFF
	I never talked about how it went down
	except to the FBI. The press got
	everything wrong.
	SHERIFF
	Excuse me. I’m with the Canton County
	Sheriff’s office. I’m gonna need to
	talk with you.
	TONYA
	Goddamnit, Jeff what’d you do??
	SHERIFF
	I’ve received a death threat.
	TONYA
	From Jeff?
	SHERIFF
	Against you.
	TONYA
	What the F?!
	JEFF
	What’d they say exactly?
	SHERIFF
	If Harding skates today, she’ll get a
	bullet in the back.
	TONYA
	What the F???!
	DIANE
	How serious should we take this?
	JEFF
	Right? I mean, girl skaters at this
	level. They’re always messing with
	each other’s skate blades. With each
	other’s costumes.
	SHERIFF
	I never knew that.
	JEFF
	Yeah, it’s a thing.
	SHERIFF
	The point is this is a large venue and
	we can’t protect you.
	JEFF
	In the end she’s too freaked out to
	skate. It screwed with her head for a
	long time.
	And. It got me thinking... Which isn’t
	always my strength.
	JEFF
	What if I do the same thing... to
	Nancy Kerrigan? Only right before
	Nationals?
	SHAWN
	To sort of even the playing field.
	JEFF
	Right. I wouldn’t be the first person
	to cheat at figure skating. A lot of
	those judges are corrupt. It’s not
	exactly prim and proper.
	SHAWN
	Someone did it to Tonya!
	JEFF
	It’s my way of saying I love you.
	SHAWN
	Interesting. Go on.
	JEFF
	No, that’s it. I figure I’ll mail
	Nancy a couple of letters to screw
	with her head.
	SHAWN
	Whoa! You f-ing greenhorn! You can’t
	mail letters from here, have it
	postmarked from Portland.
	JEFF
	No.
	SHAWN
	What we do see is, we fly someone over
	there or maybe to Massachusetts where
	she’s from, to keep suspicion off a
	us, see?
	JEFF
	Yeah.
	SHAWN
	And you’re not gonna know them and
	they’re not going to know you.
	JEFF
	Right.
	SHAWN
	I know a guy. I shouldn’t even be
	sayin’ his name. Derrick. All in,
	we’re talking- $1,000. You better let
	me handle everything.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	Us bein’ great spies, we call a
	friend who leaves a message sayin’
	where Kerrigan trains but our
	machine’s so old we sorta can’t
	understand it.
	TONYA
	She’s saying Nancy Kerrigan trains at
	Tuna Can Arena.
	JEFF
	Who’s gonna name an arena Tuna Can?
	TONYA
	Fishermen. Everyone’s fishermen in
	Massachusetts. Hi Vera. It’s Tonya
	again. Our machine’s a piece of crap.
	Could you tell me where Nancy Kerrigan
	trains again? I have a bet with Jeff.
	Spell that, hon? Uh huh. And what
	times does she train?
	It’s that fuckin’ easy. Tony Kent.
	JEFF
	Thank you. Tony Kent?
	TONYA
	Tony Kent Arena.
	JEFF
	Not - Tuna Can.
	TONYA
	Tony Kent Arena. It’s the same
	thing!
	TONYA
	That is such bullshit! The FBI found
	this piece of paper in some random
	dumpster supposedly in my hand writing
	with Nancy’s training schedule and
	shit on it.
	MARTIN MADDOX
	It was the arena Nancy skated at and
	her training times. Why did they need
	training times if they were mailing
	letters? Gillooly can change his story
	all he wants to make himself feel
	better, but he confessed to the FBI.
	Guilty.
	JEFF
	I told the FBI that Tonya was in on
	planning it and she was. But the plan
	was to mail some letters.
	JEFF
	Tonya didn’t know about the assault
	cause there was never suppose to be
	an assault. Just letters.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	I gave Shawn a thousand bucks. Nothing
	happens.
	SHAWN
	You’re gonna need to come up with more
	money.
	JEFF
	Do I have stupid written across my
	head? All they gotta do is mail the
	letters someplace. I’m not giving them
	more money.
	SHAWN
	These are 2 of my top operatives.
	Derrick needs expense moneyJEFF
	You know what? Call Derrick. Tell him
	we’re calling the whole thing off.
	Sweetie, the death
	threats off.
	TONYA
	Whatever.
	SHAWN
	Whoa! You can’t call it off. This baby
	has moving parts. Balls are already
	being played with.
	JEFF
	Too bad. All they had to do was mail
	fucking letters, Shawn!
	SHAWN
	These are not the kind of guys you
	want to double cross. Trust me.
	JEFF
	That’s your problem. And get me my
	thousand bucks back. They didn’t do
	anything.
	SHAWN
	Tonya. You still want this to happen,
	right? I can still make this happen.
	TONYA
	I don’t care, Shawn. I clearly have
	bigger shit to fry.
	SHAWN
	You eat shit?
	TONYA
	What?
	SHAWN
	Fish to fry, not shit to fry. Shit to
	fry is a meal best served never.
	TONYA
	Who cares, you big, fat, fuck?! You
	can’t make it happen anyway.
	You’re not a secret agent. You’re not
	a hit man. You’re a fat nobody gas bag
	who lives with his parents, drives a
	‘76 Mercury, is laughed at behind his
	back and has never been laid. Just
	stay away from me.
	TONYA
	I had a session later that
	night. So I was asleep.
	JEFF
	January 6th. I was sleeping
	in.
	DERRICK
	Remember, if your mind’s blank, no one
	can pick up your vibes. Also- they
	can’t identify you if they don’t see
	your eyes.
	SHANE
	My mind’s blank. Don’t let ‘em see my
	eyes
	SHANE
	...The john?
	Which one’s Kerrigan?
	MARTIN MADDOX (PRESENT DAY)
	We had no idea something like this
	could be done by 2 of the biggest
	boobs in a story populated solely by
	boobs.
	TONYA
	Holy shit!
	JEFF
	Tonya?
	TONYA
	They broke her knee!
	JEFF
	Who’s knee? What are you talking
	TONYA
	Turn on the TV. It’s everywhere. Nancy
	Kerrigan’s. Some guy. He
	JEFF
	No, no, no, no. It’s supposed to be
	letters
	TONYA
	It’s not a letter Jeff. They broke her
	fucking knee--
	JEFF
	No, no. It’s- just a death threat.
	aaaarrgghhh!!!
	LAVONA
	The fucking Moustache...
	SHAWN
	We did it man! We’re everywhere! It’s
	so friggin’ awesome!
	JEFF
	What the hell, Shawn?!? What the
	fuck did you do??
	SHAWN
	I changed the course of history!
	Whoooo!
	JEFF
	Are you insane?! No one’s supposed to
	get hurt. It’s supposed to be
	psychological warfare reSHAWN
	What if it didn’t work, Jeff? What if
	it didn’t scare her? All our hard work
	woulda been for nothing.
	JEFF
	What hard work? It was mailing fucking
	letters!!
	SHAWN
	I had to make sure it would happen.
	Look, I’m Tonya’s bodyguard. Now all
	the skaters are gonna need one. The
	money’s gonna be pouring in. I changed
	the course of history!
	JEFF
	It was a simple plan, Shawn. Why
	didn’t you just stick to it?
	SHAWN
	I did stick to the plan.
	JEFF
	This was not the plan!
	SHAWN
	This was always the plan. You think
	it’s easy? In my profession I have to
	think 4 steps ahead of everyone. Or
	did you not realize that I was the one
	who... called the death threat on
	Tonya?
	JEFF
	Why- wait, what???
	SHAWN
	People don’t take me seriously, Jeff.
	But I am in control of the situations.
	I think I proved that.
	JEFF
	This is outta control!
	SHAWN
	Relax. Everything’s great. Yes. My
	parents taped over my favorite Star
	Trek episode to record the CNN but I’m
	keeping it together!
	JEFF
	You’re a fucking idiot!
	SHAWN
	We gotta get those guys out of Detroit
	though. They’re stuck there and they
	don’t have any money. 4 steps ahead.
	JEFF
	Unbelievable!
	SHAWN
	Jeff?.. Jeff..!
	TV COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
	She told us- I know there are a lot of
	people out there who think I’m a has
	been. I have a lot to prove.
	TV COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
	It’ll be very interesting to see if
	she plays this conservatively - or
	not.
	TV COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
	She can be powerful, intimidating,
	and athletic all at the same time.
	JEFF
	Its to Derrick Smith & Shane Stant.
	TV COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
	The height and the speed are so
	different than all the other women.
	TV COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
	This is a big improvement from 2
	yeas ago.
	MANAGER
	Lavona, you got customers waiting.
	TV COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
	Oh! Huge jumps she’s doing.
	TV COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
	Great control. This is her final
	combination.
	MANAGER
	Lavona, c’mon!
	COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
	...Nicely done!!
	LAVONA
	I wanna see her face.
	MANAGER
	I said c’mon!
	LAVONA
	I wanna see her fucking face at the
	end!!
	COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
	For all the skeptics who felt that
	Tonya’s peak had passed, I think she
	proved she’s still a winner.
	COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
	This is a great moment for Tonya.
	She’s had everything go wrong. She’s
	let everything go wrong.
	And yet now all of a sudden to pull
	this off and become our national
	champion - is terrific.
	TV COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
	And it looks like she has most
	definitely earned herself a place
	on the U.S. Olympic team.
	MARTIN MADDOX (V.O.)
	Shane Stant was clueless. Before
	the attack, he waited outside the
	arena in Massachusetts he thought
	Nancy Kerrigan was training at- and
	moved his car every 15 minutes to
	avoid suspicion.
	MARTIN MADDOX (V.O.)
	He did this for 2 days until he
	found out Nancy was in Detroit.
	MARTIN MADDOX (V.O.)
	Later we found out they left a
	trail as big as the Cumberland Gap.
	Phone records. Bank records.
	SHANE
	How’d you find me?
	POLICEMAN
	Next time you pull off a hit, son,
	don’t put it on Visa.
	COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	JEFF
	Okay, fellas. That’s enough.
	Before this blows up, we have to get
	our story straight.
	TONYA
	You do the talking. You’re my manager.
	JEFF
	Okay. Cause we have to be real careful
	about what we say.
	TONYA
	We can’t afford to make a mistake. I
	waited so long for this!
	6 YEAR OLD GIRL
	Tonya I wanna be a skater like you.
	TONYA
	Thanks. Hope you mean it!
	JEFF
	We play it cool. After all, we both
	have alibis.
	TONYA
	Alibis?... For Wheaties?
	JEFF
	Wheaties? What are you talking about?
	TONYA
	My endorsement deals! Isn’t that what
	you’re talking about?
	66.
	JEFF
	The attack, Ton
	VOICE
	Excuse us.
	FBI AGENT 1
	We’re with the FBI.
	FBI AGENT #1
	It’s just a formality. We’re talking
	to everyone.
	TONYA
	We don’t know anything.
	FBI AGENT #2
	That must make life difficult.
	Maybe you heard something or saw
	TONYA
	I was asleep. And Jeff wasn’t here.
	JEFF
	I wasn’t even here!
	I was asleep too. In Oregon. At home.
	In Portland. Which is where I live.
	Which is in Oregon.
	FBI AGENT #1
	What do you make of all this, Jeff?
	JEFF
	Well. It’s a scary prospect what this
	world is coming to.
	FBI AGENT #1
	How long are you in Detroit?
	JEFF
	We’re heading to the airport now.
	FBI AGENT #1
	Well, why don’t we give you a ride?
	TONYA
	Thank you. That is so
	JEFF
	Oh, that’s not
	FBI AGENT #2
	But first. Who’s Derrick?
	TONYA
	I don’t know any Derrick.
	JEFF
	I know lots of Derricks.
	We’re gonna miss our plane.
	The FLASH of cameras going off.
	REPORTER (V.O.)
	How does it feel to be going to the
	Olympics?
	TONYA
	I’m really happy! But it won’t be a
	true crown until I get my chance with
	Nancy. And that’ll be Olympics. And
	let me tell you - I’m gonna whip her
	butt.
	REPORTER (V.O.)
	Did the FBI talk to you?
	TONYA
	I mean, they talked to everybody. And
	they, they’re doing, um - let’s see -
	a thorough investigation to try to
	find the man who did it.
	TONYA AND SHAWN
	Whooo!!!!!!
	TONYA
	I get to go to the Olympics again!
	SHAWN
	They were taking my picture!
	TONYA
	Fuck the Skating Association!
	JEFF
	This is a cluster-fuck!!!!!
	TONYA AND SHAWN
	Whooo!!!!!!
	JEFF
	It’s not funny. We gotta fix this!
	TONYA
	Fix what? We talked to the FBI.
	Everything’s fine.
	SHAWN
	She’s right man. We outsmarted em. My
	guys are paid & deep in hiding
	JEFF
	aaargghhh!!!!!!!!!
	TONYA
	What is the problem?
	JEFF
	You want to tell me what happened,
	Shawn?? Who did you talk to?
	SHAWN
	Nobody!
	JEFF
	If you tell me now, maybe I can fix
	it. But if you don’t tell me, we’re
	gonna be all fucked.
	SHAWN
	I didn’t talk to anyone.
	JEFF
	Somebody knows something and they
	shouldn’t know anything.
	SHAWN
	I never said anything!
	JEFF
	How did they come up with the name
	Derrick, Shawn??
	SHAWN
	I don’t know? How can you even ask me
	that? I could withstand torture and
	never talk. They could never break me!
	SHAWN
	That whole Nancy Kerrigan thing?
	That’s my team! We got $65,000 to take
	her down!
	SHAWN
	...Then my team obtained press
	credentials by beating up a reporter
	and used it to get inside the rink.
	SHAWN
	Bam! My hit man whacks Kerrigan with a
	retractable baton 3 times in the knee
	& again on the head. BAM! Then he
	shouts at her, he says
	FBI AGENT 1
	Shawn Eckhardt?
	SHAWN
	No.
	SHAWN’S MOTHER
	Who is it, Shawny?
	FBI AGENT #1
	What can you tell us about Tonya
	Harding?
	SHAWN
	I don’t know Tony Harding.
	FBI AGENT #2
	Aren’t you her bodyguard?
	SHAWN
	...Let me finish... Well. I don’t know
	her well.
	FBI AGENT #2
	How about Nancy Kerrigan?
	SHAWN
	Who?
	FBI AGENT #1
	You haven’t heard of Nancy Kerrigan?
	SHAWN
	Oh. I thought you said Nancy Herring.
	FBI AGENT #1
	Shawn
	SHAWN
	Jeff did it!!!
	TONYA
	What the fuck’s going on?
	JEFF
	Nothing.
	Don’t answer it!!
	Jeff Gillooly speaking?
	SHAWN
	You gotta pay me my money and I gotta
	get outta town. They know something.
	JEFF
	What? Why do youSHAWN
	We gotta meet or I’mJEFF
	Shawn, calm down. Where do you want to
	meet?
	SHAWN
	At the Golden Buddha. Meet me at the
	stroke of midnight.
	JEFF
	I’m not meeting at the fucking stroke
	of
	SHAWN
	That’s the plan, man. And bring the
	money!
	JEFF
	What’s going on, Shawn?
	SHAWN
	Nothing... Why don’t you sit down,
	Jeff?
	JEFF
	You wanna go to that bar onSHAWN
	No, no, no. This is good. Sit down.
	JEFF
	What’s up, man? You okay? You’re
	sweating an awful lot even for you.
	SHAWN
	No I’m not okay! You know I’m not
	okay... They know.
	JEFF
	Who?
	SHAWN
	You know.
	JEFF
	No.
	SHAWN
	The FBI! They know something’s up.
	JEFF
	What’s up?
	Whoa!!
	SHAWN
	Yeah!
	JEFF
	Shawn. Are you trying to tell me you
	had something to do with this whole
	Nancy Kerrigan thing?
	SHAWN
	What the fuck, Jeff?! Of course I
	JEFF
	Don’t- say another word or I’ll be
	forced to go to the authorities.
	I’ve had love in my heart for you only
	I can’t help you with this. But you
	made your bed. Now die in it.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Diane’s husband’s a lawyer so in the
	morning we meet up at their house. It
	was nice. They had a living room and
	stuff like that...
	TONYA
	Why don’t we turn his ugly, fat ass
	in? Big, dumb, freakin’, tub a guts.
	JEFF
	Cause it’s only his word against ours.
	You & I gotta stick togetherTONYA
	I’m gonna lose everything! I worked my
	whole life for this and heJEFF
	If it ever came down to that, I’d tell
	them you didn’t have anything to do
	with it. But right now we gotta get
	our story straight. Since they can’t
	pin anything on us - we didn’t know
	anything.
	TONYA
	We didn’t know anything.
	BOB
	Look. They arrested Shawn and he’s
	saying it was all your idea, Jeff.
	TONYA
	We didn’t know anything!
	JEFF
	We didn’t know anything!
	TONYA
	It was supposed to be mailing some
	JEFF
	It’s gonna be a shit show for us real
	soon. We gotta get home.
	JEFF
	What part of keeping your mouth shut
	was unclear, you stupid cunt?!
	TONYA
	There’s... There’s more than what
	you’re saying the story is, isn’t
	there..?  Did you do it?
	JEFF
	Shut up I’m telling you!!
	TONYA
	Shit! Shit! Goddamnit- How could you
	do that? Then say you love me? You
	know skating’s my life! Fuck! What did
	you do?! What did you, Jeff? What did
	TONYA
	Bam. He freakin’ nails me right in the
	face. That’s when I knew.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	To this day he has never admitted
	to me, which I wouldn’t care
	anyways, but he’s never admitted to
	me he actually did it. But I knew.
	In that moment I knew he planned it
	and he had it done.
	JEFF
	I can’t believe it. You gave me up.
	TONYA
	No. I didn’t!
	76.
	JEFF
	The FBI showed me your transcript.
	TONYA
	That’s cheating!
	JEFF
	Damn it I told you they couldn’t prove
	anything. All I wanted to do, baby,
	was protect you. You’re all I ever
	wanted.
	Honey? I fuckin’ lost you now didn’t
	I?
	TONYA
	What did you want me to say? I told
	them that you did this because you did
	fucking did this!
	JEFF
	Tonya, what am I supposed to do?
	TONYA
	I- Oh, Jeff... I think
	You really need to just kill yourself.
	INTERVIEWER
	There is a feeling out there that the
	person who was power mad, who was
	megalomaniacal was you. And that you
	had all these fantasies of espionage
	and that this whole thing was
	something you cooked up to fulfill a
	deranged fantasy.
	SHAWN
	Incorrect. Um. I’m a bodyguard and
	international counter terrorism
	expert. I work around the world for
	espionage agencies.
	INTERVIEWER
	But Shawn, you don’t.
	SHAWN
	But I do.
	INTERVIEWER
	But Shawn, we’ve checked and you
	don’t.
	SHAWN
	But I do.
	INTERVIEWER
	But you don’t.
	SHAWN
	But I do. Um. I’ve been quoted as an
	expert on terrorism trends and
	profiles
	INTERVIEWER
	Where?
	SHAWN
	Um. In. I believe it was the- oh... It
	was a travel magazine a couple years
	ago during the Gulf War.
	CONNIE CHUNG
	Here in Portland Oregon, another
	day of practice for skater Tonya
	Harding. She’s still working out
	everyday right behind me, fully
	expecting she’ll compete later this
	month at the Olympics in Norway.
	MATT LAUER
	Police and the FBI continue to keep
	looking into last weeks attack on
	skater Nancy KerriganABC REPORTER
	...Even as the U.S. Figure Skating
	Association convenes a hearing
	panel to consider if there are
	grounds to remove Tonya Harding
	from the American Olympic team.
	ANN CURRY
	...Harding’s former husband said
	Tuesday that she knew about the attack
	on Nancy Kerrigan from the beginning.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	The papers all said I plead guilty,
	which I did. But not to planning the
	attack which it turns out didn’t
	matter.  Once I knew
	about it and didn’t report it and
	tried to cover it all up, I was
	guilty.
	MARTIN MADDOX (V.O.)
	Tonya’s mom put out a red velvet
	rope in front of her house and told
	us if we wanted to take her picture
	we all had to stand behind it.
	LAVONA
	(To a reporter who is off sides)
	Get your fat ass where it belongs!
	MARTIN MADDOX (V.O.)
	AND WE DID!
	JEFF (V.O.)
	I made bail but I was charged with
	racketeering and fined $100,000...
	Which I never paid. I never talked to
	Shawn again.
	TONYA
	I thought being famous would be
	fun. I was loved for a minute. Then
	I was hated.
	Then I was a punch line. It was
	like being abused all over again.
	Only this time it was by you. All
	of you. You’re all my attackers
	too.
	TONYA
	Could you please just leave me
	alone?... For now.
	LAVONA
	So what’s new?
	I like your hair pulled back like
	that. Makes you look young.
	TONYA
	I’m 23, mom.
	LAVONA
	You seem like you’re holding up good.
	Fuck ‘em, you know?
	TONYA
	I know.
	LAVONA
	I never did like that Jeff.
	TONYA
	Mom
	LAVONA
	I’m not here to say I told you so. I’m
	not.
	TONYA
	Why are you here?
	LAVONA
	I want you to know... I don’t know.
	I’m on your side. I want you to know.
	Big crowd out there. A lot of people
	support you.
	You’ve done good. I’m proud of you.
	All right. I’m going.
	Hon- Did you know about the attack?
	You can tell me.
	TONYA
	Perfect.
	LAVONA
	...I still meant everything I said.
	I still meant everything I said!
	MARTIN MADDOX (V.O.)
	Okay- I used to flatten her tires,
	have her truck towed so we could
	get a shot of her, ya know? This
	was the 1st time there was a 24
	hour news cycle to fill. We all
	needed that story.
	TONYA
	This is bullshit. I shouldn’t have to
	apologize for what I didn’t do.
	BOB
	Tonya there’s talk about not letting
	you skate in the Olympics at all. You
	need to give them this. We’re hanging
	on by a thread here.
	TONYA
	I earned my place on the team fair and
	square!
	BOB
	Well. Taking out the competition with
	a retractable baton doesn’t strike
	everyone that way.
	TONYA
	I didn’t know about it!
	DIANE
	And that’s exactly what you’re gonna
	say. Jesus! Did Jeff do that?
	TONYA
	I can’t fucking focus when I’m skating
	and I keep falling in front of
	everyone. While Nancy gets her own
	private rink where they catch her
	before she falls probably andDIANE
	Honey. You’ll apologize and this whole
	thing will be over.
	TONYA
	Okay. I’ll do whatever it takes.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	I apologized for ever knowing or being
	associated with Jeff which it looks
	like I’ll never stop doing ever.
	TONYA
	I had no prior knowledge of the
	assault on Nancy Kerrigan. I am
	responsible however for frailing (she
	laughs nervously, whispers excuse me,
	checks her notes) for failing to
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Then when the Olympic Committee
	threatened to take me off the team,
	I filed a $10 million lawsuit
	against them. I mean, it was
	getting ugly. (To the camera) But
	do you think CBS who was showin’
	the games was gonna let this
	ginormous ratings fucker not
	happen?
	TONYA
	The whole entire world was waiting for
	a showdown between me and Nancy. No. I
	made the team. And I was ready to show
	you all.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	I was asked to comment on everything
	for Hard Copy. And they paid me a lot
	which was cool.
	CBS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And now the public address is
	announcing Tonya Harding’s name. It is
	her turn to be on the ice right now.
	CBS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	Tonya Harding, after her warm up, had
	a problem with her laces.
	CBS ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
	If she’s not out here I think
	they’re gonna disqualify her. I’m
	not sure. I’ve never seen anything
	like this before.
	TONYA
	How long do I have?
	DIANE
	One minute.
	TONYA
	A minute?
	TONYA
	It’s not going to hold me!!
	TONYA
	I’m gonna break my ankle.
	TONYA
	My lace broke! I can’t- I really tried
	to get out her on time. Please...
	CBS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	In a situation like this, the judging
	panel will give her her best
	opportunity to put out her best
	performance. Things like this just
	don’t happen!
	CBS ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
	Well I think they’re allowing Tonya
	to fix her skate! Again, this is
	every skaters recurring nightmare.
	TONYA
	Could I just say one quick thing about
	Nancy Kerrigan?
	TONYA (V.O.)
	So my lace breaks which I guess is my
	fault but really kinda isn’t and I go
	out and do the same stuff as everybody
	else but I didn’t get the marks cause
	I didn’t have a shot with the judges
	to begin with.
	TONYA
	It was a big story. But I don’t need a
	big story. I’m a big story on my own
	when I skate. I did my best and I got
	8th. But Nancy
	TONYA (V.O.)
	She goes out and gives a beautiful
	skate- I never said different- She
	wins a friggin’ silver medal & when
	they put that medal round her neck she
	looked like she stepped in poo.
	TONYA
	Come on! I mean, how am I the poor
	sport in all of this?
	They postponed my trial until after
	the Olympics.
	JUDGE LONDER
	Tonya Harding. You are hereby
	sentenced to 3 years probation,
	$100,000 fine plus $10,000 to the
	D.A.’s office for special costs.
	Another $50,000 to set up a fund for
	the Special Olympics. 500 hours
	community service; a psychological
	evaluation
	-and your immediate resignation from
	the US Figure Skating Association
	Banning you for life from all Figure
	Skating Association competitions and
	events.
	TONYA
	No. All I did was hindering
	prosecution. You’re never gonna let me
	skate again? I’d rather do jail time.
	They only got 18 months.
	They got 18 months. I’ll do that. Your
	honor. I don’t have education. All I
	know is skating. I’m no one if I’m
	can’t- I’m not this monster. I’m
	trying to do the best with what I know
	how to-. It’s like you’re giving me a
	life sentence. You can’t do that.
	JUDGE LONDER
	Miss Harding. That’s enoughTONYA
	Please! Just send me to jail so
	then I can still skate!
	JUDGE LONDER
	I’ve given you my decision.
	TTV HOST (V.O.)
	The top 10 excuses by Tonya Harding at
	the Olympics. #4, got scared by
	Nancy’s giant teeth. #3, two words:
	Rental Skates. #2, got mixed up before
	competition and hit self in knee with
	lead pipe. And the #1 excuse by Tonya
	Harding: Couldn’t land the triple
	Gillooly.
	JEFF
	I got a 2 year sentence and did 8
	months to the day.
	JEFF (V.O.)
	All that craziness, everything I’ll
	ever be known for, from start to
	finish was just a few months. Before I
	went to jail, I got up one morning,
	the press had just disappeared. Like I
	dreamed it.
	LAVONA
	I never see Tonya anymore and this
	is fine. I could care less. I lead
	a full life... I’m very happy.
	JEFF
	Tonya would never have thought of
	calling in a death threat. And I was
	more caught up in the terrible things
	she was saying about me rather than
	the fact that I ruined her career.
	Absolutely ruined it.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Once I was banned from figure
	skating for life, I didn’t have a
	lot of options.
	TONYA
	I did what I hada do to stay in the
	public eye and pay the bills.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	I was the second most known person
	behind Bill Clinton in the world.
	That meant something. People still
	wanted to see me. So I became a
	lady boxer. I mean, why not?
	Violence was always what I knew
	anyway.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	America, you know. They want
	someone to love but they want
	someone to hate. And they want it
	easy.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	But what’s easy? The haters always
	say, Tonya just tell the truth. But
	there’s no such thing as truth.
	It’s bullshit.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	Everyone has their own truth. And
	life just does whatever the fuck it
	wants.
	TONYA (V.O.)
	That’s the story of my life....
	TONYA
	And that’s the fucking truth!
