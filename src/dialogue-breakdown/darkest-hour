	ATTLEE
	Mr Speaker! Mr Speaker!
	SPEAKER
	The Honourable Leader of the
	Opposition, Clement Attlee!
	ATTLEE
	Mr Speaker--Mr Speaker--it seems I
	have not been clear enough. Then
	let me leave no doubt regarding my
	feelings about Mr Chamberlain’s
	future as Prime Minister.
	(over boos and applause)
	Owing to his years of inactivity
	and incompetence -
	- we find him personally
	responsible, personally responsible
	for leaving our nation ruinously
	unprepared to face the present Nazi
	peril. We are at war, Mr Speaker.
	At war. And leaving aside whether
	he is fit to be a leader in peacetime he has proven himself
	incapable of leading us in wartime.
	Therefore, in the national
	interest, we the Opposition, are
	willing to enter into a Grand
	Coalition--with the “ruling”
	Conservative Party, so-called!...
	SPEAKER
	Order! Order!
	ATTLEE
	...but not, and I stress this,
	never, under the leadership of Mr
	Chamberlain...
	...who has lost the confidence of
	this House!
	In the country’s interest man,
	resign! Step down! And let us
	find a new leader!
	SPEAKER
	I said, ORDER!
	KINGSLEY WOOD
	Where’s Winston?
	EDEN
	Ensuring his fingerprints
	are not on the murder weapon.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Accordingly--tomorrow--I will
	resign as Prime Minister.
	As the Opposition refuse to join a
	government headed by me, we must
	select my successor.
	I will step down tomorrow but I
	wanted my own party, the gentlemen
	I most respect, to know first.
	LORD LONDONDERRY.
	Halifax. There’s no question!
	Our Foreign Secretary -
	SIR JOHN SIMON
	No contest! HALIFAX
	HALIFAX
	I appreciate your confidence but my
	time has yet to come. However, on
	whomever the task may fall, he
	shall be charged with the security
	of these islands and of our Empire,
	and shall be required to explore
	all avenues.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Including that of Diplomatic talks.
	HALIFAX
	Indeed, towards the restoration of
	peace in Europe.
	ALL
	Hear Hear!!!
	3.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Gentlemen, I’m afraid there is only
	one candidate. Only, one man that
	the Opposition will accept?
	ALL
	Oh no.
	SIR JOHN SIMON
	Surely not...
	JOHN EVANS
	...and if he stretches out his hand
	and says, “Gimme”, you need to
	anticipate what he wants - black
	pen, red pen, paper, or “Clop”,
	that’s his hole punch.
	SAWYERS
	Don’t smudge the ink.
	MAID
	How selfish to resign, time like
	this.
	COOK
	D’you think they’ll take me to
	Downing Street?
	SAWYERS
	Not after the Spotted Dick you
	served last week.
	JOHN EVANS
	...He mumbles, so it’s almost
	impossible to catch everything.
	And be prepared to type fast –
	short bursts - and double-spaced,
	he hates single-spaced--hates it!
	Good luck.
	WINSTON
	To the French Ambassador. Come on -
	telegram!
	With German forces crossing into
	Holland...Holland alone...request
	reassurance...that French forces
	will now move--move at once--to
	protect Belgium. Stop. Read!
	ELIZABETH
	“To--to the French Ambassador.
	With German forces crossing
	into Holland...Holland alone...
	request reassurance that -
	WINSTON
	- immediate reassurance -
	ELIZABETH
	“- immediate - reassurance - “
	WINSTON
	“ - that -” Go on - “- that “
	ELIZABETH
	“ - that - “
	SAWYERS
	French Ambassador sir -
	WINSTON
	Monsieur Ambassador!
	Ah. They’ve already invaded
	Belgium.
	I will convey your plea to the
	Prime Minister at once. Yes, the
	situation is still very confused.
	Goodbye.
	Holland and Belgium.
	No, no, no.
	ELIZABETH
	Sir?
	WINSTON
	Scrap that. New telegram.
	6.
	To General Ismay...
	Dammit Sawyers! What is it now?!
	SAWYERS
	Your son.
	WINSTON
	Randolph, quickly -
	Last night they said I may be made
	Prime Minister today. But that was
	yesterday. Let’s see what Neville
	does today. Thank--thank you my
	boy. Keep buggering on!
	Now...
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	General Ismay...
	WINSTON
	Ah, General Ismay.
	Sawyers - get rid of this will you?
	In the light of today’s events, the
	time is ripe for many preparations
	to be made...
	Are you striking those typewriter
	keys in a normal fashion? It’s
	awfully loud, I can’t think!
	Read it back.
	7.
	ELIZABETH
	Ahh--To General Ismay. In the light
	of today’s events, the time is
	right for many prep -
	WINSTON
	RIPE! Not RIGHT! God's teeth girl!
	I said ripe, ripe, ripe - P-P-P!
	The last sentence...
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	(shaken)
	The--the time is ripe...
	WINSTON
	For! FOR!
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	(her nerve broken)
	...many...many...many...
	WINSTON
	How many “many”s did you write?!
	One many!
	(sighs)
	“For...for MANY preparations--
	to be made...”
	Single-spaced? What are you doing?!
	What are you doing?!
	ELIZABETH
	Someone set it on single-spaced
	and before I realised -
	WINSTON
	Then why did you persist?!
	ELIZABETH
	I -
	WINSTON
	Tell Evans to send me someone who
	can do it right the first time!
	right! t-t-T-T!
	CLEMMIE
	Ah. He shouted at you. Did he shout
	at you?
	ELIZABETH
	Yes, but I....
	CLEMMIE
	He can be an awful brute.
	ELIZABETH
	No! I made too many mistakes.
	CLEMMIE
	I think you were nervous. And he
	has a knack for drawing out the
	very worst in those trying to
	help him the most.
	ELIZABETH
	Oh it’s not him. It’s me. He’s -
	he’s -
	CLEMMIE
	He’s just a man, like any other.
	Wait here.
	CLEMMIE
	My Darling?
	WINSTON
	The War Cabinet has been called.
	The bloody cat is under the bed
	again.
	CLEMMIE
	Can I tell you something that I
	feel you ought to know?
	I’ve noticed a recent deterioration
	in your manner. You’re not so kind
	as you used to be. You’ve become
	rough, sarcastic, over-bearing and
	rude.
	WINSTON
	Is this about the new girl?
	CLEMMIE
	If the King asks you to become
	Prime Minister -
	WINSTON
	We don’t know that -
	CLEMMIE
	I don’t want you to be disliked.
	WINSTON
	More than I already am?
	CLEMMIE
	Darling, you may be on the brink,
	the brink--of having tremendous
	power, surpassed only by the King.
	With such power you really must try
	to be more kind and, if possible,
	calm. I want others to love and
	respect you as I do.
	BBC RADIO ANNOUNCER
	“This is BBC Home Service. Here is
	a short news bulletin. The German
	army invaded Holland and Belgium
	early this morning, by land, and
	land parachutes--
	ELIZABETH
	There’s a telegram.
	JOHN EVANS
	Sssshhh!
	BBC RADIO ANNOUNCER
	...”The Armies of the Low Countries
	are resisting. An appeal for help
	has been made to the Allied
	governments and Brussels says the
	Allied troops are moving to their
	support...”
	ELIZABETH
	It’s from the Palace.
	WINSTON
	Thank you, Miss...?
	ELIZABETH
	Layton.
	CLEMMIE
	You’re shaking.
	WINSTON
	So are you!
	CLEMMIE
	You from excitement--I from terror.
	You have been wanting this your
	entire adult life.
	WINSTON
	No--since the nursery.
	But do the public want me?
	CLEMMIE
	It’s your own Party to whom you’ll
	have to prove yourself.
	WINSTON
	I’m getting the job only because
	the ship is sinking. It’s not a
	gift, it’s revenge.
	CLEMMIE
	Let them see your true qualities.
	Your courage...
	WINSTON
	...My poor judgement.
	CLEMMIE
	...Your lack of vanity.
	WINSTON
	...My iron will.
	CLEMMIE
	(in playful rebuke)
	...Your sense of humour.
	WINSTON
	Ho Ho Ho!
	CLEMMIE
	Now go.
	WINSTON
	Go?
	CLEMMIE
	Be.
	WINSTON
	Be?
	She touches his face tenderly -
	CLEMMIE
	Yourself.
	WINSTON
	Which self?
	Which self should I be today?
	One should have had power when a
	young man. When wits were sharp,
	sinews strong. Oh well.
	Lead on Macduff--
	When youth departs--
	may wisdom prove enough.
	JOHN EVANS
	Hardly seems like there’s a war
	on at all.
	WINSTON
	How odd it is.
	JOHN EVANS
	Sir?
	WINSTON
	You know--I have never ridden a
	bus. Never queued for bread. I
	believe I can boil an egg but only
	because I saw it done once.
	WINSTON
	The only time I tried to ride the
	Underground was during the General
	Strike. Clemmie dropped me at South
	Kensington station. I went down--
	but I got lost and came straight
	back up. Awful!
	Well, “Here we go”...
	EVANS
	Good luck sir.
	GEORGE VI
	Why not Halifax? I favour Halifax.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	I wanted Halifax. The Lords wanted
	Halifax. Halifax wanted Halifax.
	GEORGE VI
	Then--then why have I been forced
	to send for Churchill?
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Because he’s the only member of our
	party who has the support of the
	Opposition.
	GEORGE VI
	His record is a litany of
	catastrophe. Gallipoli, 25,000
	dead. The India Policy. Russian
	Civil War. The Gold Standard. The
	the the Abdication. And now this
	Norway ‘adventure’. What, eighteen
	hundred men?
	CHAMBERLAIN
	One aircraft carrier, two cruisers,
	seven destroyers and a submarine.
	GEORGE VI
	Winston lacks judgement.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	He was right about Hitler.
	GEORGE VI
	Even a stopped clock is right
	twice a day.
	EQUERRY
	First Lord of the Admiralty,
	Mr Winston Churchill!
	GEORGE VI
	Early.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Keen.
	GEORGE VI
	I accept your resignation--but I
	want you to know--how--cruelly I
	think you’ve been treated.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Thank you Your Majesty.
	EQUERRY
	This way, my Lord.
	WINSTON
	Your Majesty.
	GEORGE VI
	Mr Churchill.
	I believe you know why I--I
	I have asked you here today.
	WINSTON
	Sir, I simply can’t imagine why.
	15.
	GEORGE VI
	It is my duty to-to-to invite you
	to take up - the position of of
	Prime Minister of this United
	Kingdom. Will you form a
	government?
	WINSTON
	I will.
	GEORGE VI
	Very well.
	That was--quite easy.
	WINSTON
	Yes.
	I believe we are to meet regularly.
	GEORGE VI
	Once a week, I’m afraid. How are
	you on--on--on Mondays?
	WINSTON
	I shall endeavour to be available
	on Mondays.
	GEORGE VI
	Four o’clock?
	WINSTON
	I nap at 4.
	GEORGE VI
	Is that--permissible?
	WINSTON
	No. But necessary. I work late.
	GEORGE VI
	Then perhaps lunch?
	WINSTON
	Lunch! Mondays.
	Your majesty.
	GEORGE VI
	Prime Minister.
	PHOTOGRAPHER
	Prime Minister? First order of
	business, sir?
	WINSTON
	A glass of Pol Roger!
	is greeted by EDEN.
	EDEN
	Prime Minister!
	WINSTON
	Anthony.
	EDEN
	How was the K-k-king?
	WINSTON
	Anxious. Never forgiven me for
	supporting his brother’s
	marriage to Wallis Simpson.
	EDEN
	You only have to meet him once a
	week.
	WINSTON
	That’s like saying you only have to
	have your tooth pulled once a week.
	EDEN
	Composition of your War Cabinet.
	Who should sit on it?
	WINSTON
	Chamberlain. And the Reverend “Holy
	Fox” -
	EDEN
	Halifax. Keeping your enemies
	close?
	WINSTON
	More than that, without them the
	party will get rid of me.
	And that sheep in sheep’s clothing,
	Attlee.
	MARY CHURCHILL
	Come on Daddy--everyone’s waiting.
	WINSTON
	Be there in a jiffy, my love.
	EDEN
	I heard that before you were asked,
	they offered it to Lord Halifax.
	WINSTON
	I doubt that. Halifax would never
	turn it down. He's the fourth son
	of an Earl. Fourth sons turn
	nothing down.
	EDEN
	I only wish the position had come
	your way in better times, sir. You
	have an enormous task ahead of you.
	WINSTON
	I hope it’s not too late. I am
	very much afraid it is. But we can
	only do our best.
	CHURCHILL CHILDREN
	hurraY!
	RANDOLPH CHURCHILL
	Hip Hip -
	CHURCHILL CHILDREN
	Hurray!
	WINSTON
	Good lord, what a frightful sight!
	CHURCHILL
	Thank you. Thank you.
	PAMELA
	A toast! Come on!
	DIANA
	Yes!
	CLEMMIE
	My darling husband--Something you
	all might not know is that on the
	eve of our marriage I got “cold
	feet”--but as I’d already called
	off two engagements by the age of
	21 I was in danger of gaining a
	reputation for being a ‘bolter’--
	and it would’ve been poor form to
	call off a third!
	RANDOLPH
	Hear hear.
	DIANA
	Lucky for Daddy.
	19.
	CLEMMIE
	But the real reason for my wintry
	feet was because I knew, even then,
	that his priority would be public
	life. It worried a young girl
	greatly--this wretched thought of
	coming second, eternally. But so it
	has proven to be. And in due course
	(Mary takes Winstons hand)
	our children would also have to
	make their own peace with this same
	fact.
	(directly to Winston)
	We all did, you see, in our own
	ways. And now, today, we all
	receive our reward--proof that our
	small sacrifice was for a far, far
	greater good. I give you, your
	father, my beloved husband - the
	Prime Minister.
	ALL
	Prime Minister!
	CHURCHILL
	Here’s to-- not buggering
	it up.
	FAMILY
	Not buggering it up!
	WINSTON
	Belgium was a ploy. They just
	punched through the Ardennes into
	France and crossed the Meuse in
	under 24 hours!
	EDEN
	No-one can cross the Meuse River in
	24 hours.
	WINSTON
	Apparently the Germans can.
	WINSTON
	Contempt. Well, you have to
	start somewhere.
	SIR SAMUEL HOARE
	Here we go.
	WINSTON
	Mr Speaker. On Friday evening last--
	I received His Majesty’s commission
	to form a new administration...
	...It was the evident wish and will
	of Parliament, and the Nation, that
	this should be conceived on the
	broadest possible basis, and that
	it should include all parties.
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	A War Cabinet has been convened...
	Correction - “has been formed” -
	WINSTON
	- has been formed--of five members -
	WINSTON
	...representing, with the
	Opposition parties, the unity of
	the Nation.
	ELIZABETH (O.S.)
	The three party Leaders have agreed
	to serve, either in the War CabinetINT. COMMONS/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
	ELIZABETH (O.S.)
	- or in high executive
	office.
	WINSTON
	- or in high executive
	office.
	WINSTON (CONT’D)
	The three fighting Services have
	been filled.
	WINSTON
	Sawyers is she there?
	ELIZABETH
	Yes she is.. I mean, I am
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	Don’t come in!
	Don’t go away!
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	No, no--I’m still here.
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	“With this agreement, I now invite
	the House -
	(water sounds)
	- by the resolution which stands in
	my name, to record its approval,
	and to declare its confidence in
	the new government.”
	Sound of WINSTON getting out of the BATH.
	WINSTON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
	Miss? I’m coming out in a state
	of nature!
	WINSTON
	I now invite the House by a
	resolution to declare its
	confidence in the new government.
	KINGSLEY WOOD
	Look to Chamberlain’s handkerchief.
	If he waves it at the end of
	Churchill’s speech, we show
	approval, if not, keep quiet.
	WINSTON
	It must be remembered that we are
	in the preliminary stage of one of
	the greatest battles in history...
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	...and that many preparations have
	to be made here at home.
	Sir, I take up my task with
	buoyancy and hope -
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	- and say to the House, as I said
	to those who have joined the
	government -
	WINSTON
	- I have nothing to offer but
	blood, toil--tears--and sweat.
	WINSTON
	We have before us an ordeal of the
	most grievous kind. We have before
	us many, many long months of
	struggle and of suffering. You ask,
	what is our policy? I say it is to
	wage war by sea, land and air, with
	all our might and with all the
	strength God can give us--to wage
	war against a monstrous tyranny
	never surpassed in the dark and
	lamentable catalogue of human
	crime.
	That is our policy. You ask, what
	is our aim? I can answer in one
	word. Victory - victory at all
	costs, victory in spite of terror,
	victory however long and hard the
	road may be. For without victory,
	there is no survival.
	HALIFAX
	“Our policy is to wage war--At all
	costs--No survival”. Winston is
	incapable of pronouncing the word
	peace, let alone engaging in peace
	talks.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Awful, the thought that I shall
	never see my country at peace
	again.
	HALIFAX
	Neville?
	CHAMBERLAIN
	I have cancer.
	HALIFAX
	Oh Neville.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Winston must be removed from
	office.
	HALIFAX
	How?
	CHAMBERLAIN
	A vote of “no confidence”.
	HALIFAX
	If we can get him to declare that
	he refuses to consider a negotiated
	peace with Germany then perhaps you
	and I will have grounds to resign.
	The party wont stand for that,
	you’re still the chairman for
	heavens sake, that will force a
	vote of “no confidence” in his
	leadership and he’ll be finished.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	And would you agree to be Prime
	Minister?
	HALIFAX
	With Winston out of the way ... who
	can say, but the important thing,
	Neville, is that your policies, of
	peace and the protection of this
	nation, would be back on the table.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	On record.
	HALIFAX
	Pardon?
	CHAMBERLAIN
	He must declare on record his
	refusal to engage in peace talks,
	we must have it in writing.
	JOHN EVANS
	Follow me.
	ELIZABETH
	What goes on down here?
	27.
	JOHN EVANS
	That’s a need to know. And you
	don’t.
	ELIZABETH
	The lavatory?
	EVANS
	For the PM’s use only.
	Sleeping quarters, for when you
	miss the last train.
	They pass the MAP ROOM -
	JOHN EVANS
	That’s the Map Room. No women
	allowed.
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	What department is this?
	JOHN EVANS
	Indiscretion in conversation, or
	any other form, within or without
	these rooms regarding what happens
	here is a statutory offense and
	punishable by up to two years
	imprisonment with hard labour.
	Clear?
	ELIZABETH
	Crystal.
	JOHN EVANS
	Good.
	That’s the War Cabinet room--never!
	Don’t mean to be rough on you but
	them’s the rules.
	This is the typists room, you are
	allowed in here.
	TYPISTS
	Good Morning Sir.
	JOHN EVANS
	And here’s you.
	GENERAL IRONSIDE
	Belgium and Holland may fall any
	hour.
	WINSTON
	The French?
	29.
	GENERAL IRONSIDE
	The entire French ninth army--some
	two hundred thousand men--have
	capitulated.
	HALIFAX
	All of them?!
	GENERAL IRONSIDE
	Capitulated. Surrendered. Deserted.
	It was a rout. All our land forces,
	roughly 300,000 men, are now in
	full retreat.
	WINSTON
	Air-cover? For our troops?
	AIR MARSHALL DOWDING
	The Luftwaffe control the skies.
	We simply don’t have enough planes
	to challenge them. In fact, I
	strongly recommend we stop sending
	our precious fighter-planes to be
	wasted in France--save them for
	our own defence.
	WINSTON
	And our navy--sits idle,
	neutralized, useless.
	NAVAL ADMIRAL POUND
	Our fleets no sooner come within
	their range than we come under
	blistering air attack.
	WINSTON
	Their speed is devastating.
	GENERAL IRONSIDE
	Panzer tanks. Plunging rapidly
	westward, through the centre.
	WINSTON
	But they will have to pause for
	fuel supplies.
	GENERAL IRONSIDE
	Ismay?
	ISMAY
	This is not the last war, Sir.
	Their tanks can stop for fuel at a
	petrol station.
	WINSTON
	Petrol station?
	GENERAL IRONSIDE
	The road to Paris now lies open.
	7 million refugees are on the move.
	Collectively we are looking at the
	collapse of Western Europe in a
	few days.
	ISMAY
	Should the public be told?
	WINSTON
	Not yet. First, we must rouse
	our old friends to an heroic
	resistance. France must be saved.
	WINSTON
	This can’t go on. Must not.
	WINSTON
	Brace yourselves, I am about to
	add to your terrible suffering--
	by speaking French.
	They sit at a long table in the hangar.
	Bien que notre situation soit très
	grave ce n'est pas la première fois
	que nous faisons face à une crise,
	ensemble.
	WINSTON
	We have--we have survived crises
	before, and I am confident we will
	survive this one. Tell me how you
	plan to counter-attack.
	REYNAUD
	There is no plan.
	WINSTON
	You must counter-attack. Premier,
	you must!
	You must counter-attack!
	Vous devez contrattaquer! Il le
	faut! Gentlemen--I do not believe
	this Panzer breakthrough is a real
	invasion.
	REYNAUD
	Not a real invasion?
	DALADIER
	Tell this to the families of the
	dead perhaps.
	REYNAUD
	We sincerely appreciate your
	efforts and optimism, but--we have
	lost.
	WINSTON
	As long as--as their tanks are not
	supported by infantry units they
	are merely little flags, stuck
	on the map, because the tank crews
	are unable to support themselves.
	No, I refuse to see in this
	spectacular raid of the German
	tanks a real invasion.
	REYNAUD
	Il Devine! Delusional! 
	DALADIER
	C’est Anglais (He’s English.)
	SIR JOHN SIMON
	He’s an actor. In love with the
	sound of his own voice.
	LONDONDERRY
	Oh I love to listen to him--but
	we must never take his advice. Has
	a hundred ideas a day. Four are
	good, the other 96 downright
	dangerous.
	SIR JOHN SIMON
	His father was a great orator
	but...
	LONDONDERRY
	Until he lost his mind to syphilis -
	SIR JOHN SIMON
	How nations suffer for the sins of
	their fathers.
	STANHOPE
	My opinion? At this critical
	juncture for the empire, we have a
	drunkard at the wheel.
	SIR SAMUEL HOARE
	Wakes with a scotch, bottle of
	champagne at lunch, another at
	dinner, brandy and port till the
	wee hours...I wouldn’t let him
	borrow my bicycle!
	KINGSLEY WOOD
	He’s a Conservative, who defects to
	the Liberals--lobs grenades at us
	for 10 years--then flops
	Conservative again, as it bloody
	suits him! Sorry, but--he stands
	for one thing: himself!
	HALIFAX
	We might have to replace him,
	Bertie.
	KING GEORGE VI
	Replace him?!
	HALIFAX
	We must strive for peace--for every
	son and daughter of this land so
	that we may emerge from this crisis
	with something recognisable as
	'home.'
	KING GEORGE VI
	Spoken like a true Prime Minister.
	JOHN EVANS
	Sir, you need to reply to the Lord
	Privy Seal.
	WINSTON
	The Privy Seal?
	JOHN EVANS
	Yes sir?
	WINSTON
	“V for Victory”
	Tell the Lord Privy Seal -
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	- tell him I’m sealed in the
	Privy -
	- and I can only deal with
	one shit at a time!
	Don’t spare me, Anthony--be frank.
	EDEN
	Mmmmm.
	WINSTON
	I think it’s rather good. The
	ending especially.
	EDEN
	I don’t think so.
	WINSTON
	You don’t think so, what?
	36.
	EDEN
	You’re suggesting we’re--somehow--
	winning.
	We’re not.
	WINSTON
	No but...it will inspire them.
	WINSTON (CONT'D)
	You don’t understand -
	EDEN
	Winston, I know -
	WINSTON
	- no, no, no. I am going to imbue
	them, Anthony, with a spirit of
	feeling they don’t yet know they
	have!
	EDEN
	You asked my opinion. I caution
	against it.
	WINSTON
	Cicero!
	WINSTON 
	“Live as“, “Live as brave men” -
	da,da,da - “and if fortune is
	adverse, something, something,
	something
	WINSTON
	Clemmie!!! cat!!! Clemmie!!!
	Cat--my copy of Cicero. Did you
	shelve it?
	CLEMMIE
	Did you hear what I said?!
	WINSTON
	What’s that?
	CLEMMIE
	We’re broke.
	WINSTON
	Everybody out! Get out!
	CLEMMIE
	I dare not write another cheque.
	WINSTON
	I’ll economise - only four cigars
	a day!
	CLEMMIE
	You’re insufferable!
	Was there something else? Anything?
	WINSTON
	Yes, my love for you.
	CLEMMIE
	How much have you had to drink
	this morning?
	WINSTON
	I see you now as I first saw you in
	nineteen hundred and four across a
	crowded dance-floor. I simply stood-
	-speechless.
	CLEMMIE
	I must have been very beautiful to
	have achieved that miraculous
	effect.
	WINSTON
	Four years till we saw each other
	again.
	CLEMMIE
	They went by in an absolute flash.
	WINSTON
	You didn’t lack for admirers. Your
	fidèle serviteur in Sidney Peel.
	CLEMMIE
	Brilliant man.
	WINSTON
	Lionel Earle.
	CLEMMIE
	Wonderful dancer.
	WINSTON
	And then--at Lady St Hellier’s
	dinner party--who should show up?
	CLEMMIE
	Pig. (little snort)
	WINSTON
	The same.
	CLEMMIE
	Are we terribly old?
	WINSTON
	Yes. I’m afraid you are.
	Will you hear me read my speech for
	tonight’s broadcast?
	TERENCE BIRKEMP
	Prime Minister - the situation
	in France - Is it true we’re
	BBC PRODUCER
	So--if you will sit here - at your
	desk
	WINSTON
	Mmmmm.
	WINSTON sits, studying with CONCERN the SPEECH lying on the
	table in front of him, and taking out his PEN.
	BBC PRODUCER
	- and speak slowly and clearly.
	Into the microphone.
	So--if you are ready--on the stroke
	of 9 the light will go red, and we
	shall go live to the nation. Nine O
	Clock. Red light. You begin. Yes?
	Prime Minister? Are we ready?
	WINSTON
	One moment, one moment -
	BBC PRODUCER
	We are going live. Prime -
	WINSTON
	I said one momemnt damn you!
	BBC PRODUCER
	Four--three--two--one...
	WINSTON
	“I speak to you for the first time
	as Prime Minister in a solemn hour
	for the life of our country, of our
	Empire, of our allies, and, above
	all, of the cause of Freedom. A
	tremendous battle is raging in
	France and Flanders.”
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	“The Germans...by a remarkable
	combination of air bombing and
	heavily armored tanks, have broken
	through the French defenses north
	of the Maginot Line, and strong
	columns of their armoured vehicles
	are ravaging the open country...”
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	“...which for the first day or two
	was without defenders...But!...I
	have invincible confidence in the
	French Army and its leaders. Only a
	very small part of that splendid
	Army has yet been heavily engaged;
	and only a very small part of
	France has yet been invaded...Side
	by side, the British and French
	peoples--have advanced...”
	HALIFAX
	“Advanced”?! How bloody dare he!
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	“...the British and French peoples--
	have advanced--to rescue not only
	Europe, but mankind from the
	foulest and most soul-destroying
	tyranny which has ever darkened and
	stained the pages of history.
	WINSTON
	“But now one bond unites us all -
	to wage war until victory is won,
	and never to surrender ourselves to
	servitude and shame, whatever the
	cost and the agony may be...Conquer
	we must, as conquer we shall.”
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	Well done, sir.
	CLEMMIE
	You did marvelously.
	WINSTON
	For the last ten years I was the
	only one who told them the truth.
	Until tonight. There’s no advance.
	It’s a shambles. We’re in full
	retreat.
	CLEMMIE
	Would you be serving them tonight
	by denying them sleep, terrifying
	their children?
	WINSTON
	Even if the terror is coming?!
	CLEMMIE
	Because it’s coming! There is
	time enough for truth.
	WINSTON
	What’s so funny?
	ELIZABETH
	Prime Minister sir -
	WINSTON
	Go on. What is it?
	ELIZABETH
	Not sure if you know this but--
	the way you are doing your
	V For Victory sign--well, in
	the poorer quarters that gesture
	means--something else.
	WINSTON
	What does it mean?
	ELIZABETH
	Wouldn’t like to say sir.
	WINSTON
	I was captured by the Boer. I spent
	time in a South African prison.
	ELIZABETH
	Up yer’ bum. Sir.
	WINSTON
	Up yer’ bum?.
	ELIZABETH
	The way you do it, sir. Yes sir.
	But if you turn it around -
	- that’s fine.
	WINSTON
	I see.
	ELIZABETH
	Wouldn’t like millions of people to
	take it the wrong way.
	WINSTON
	Up yer’ bum!
	KING GEORGE VI
	Don’t wish to take too much of your
	time.
	I heard you--on the--wireless.
	WINSTON
	Was I comprehensible?
	KING GEORGE VI
	The public need to be led, not
	misled--not left to work it out
	for them-themselves.
	WINSTON
	Right. Will that be all, your
	majesty?
	KING GEORGE VI
	Yes. Good day Prime Minister.
	WINSTON
	I believe I’ve just recieved a
	royal rap on the knuckles.
	CABINET SECRETARY BRIDGES
	Foreign Minister?
	WINSTON
	Tiny, good to see you.
	Pug. Welcome to the War Cabinet,
	such as we are.
	Please, sit.
	War is usually a catalogue of
	blunders, and this one is proving
	no exception.
	(beat)
	General - its all yours.
	IRONSIDE
	You have this morning’s report in
	front of you -
	WINSTON
	Yes. General -
	IRONSIDE
	- if you turn to page 3 -
	Ummm - so on page 3 - are we all
	Looking at page 3? - no, the other
	document - second paragraph down -
	GREENWOOD
	Second?
	IRONSIDE
	Yes, the second--no, page -
	WINSTON
	Edmund!--why don’t you just tell us-
	-please--in your own words-- what
	kind of mess we are looking at
	here. What’s going on?
	IRONSIDE
	Right.  As of 2200 hours last
	night--the Germans have encircled
	sixty British, Belgian and French
	divisions. On our part all our
	forces under Lord Gort have now
	withdrawn, or are trying to
	withdraw, to the French coast, to
	Dunkirk, where we cannot reach them.
	Ships sunk by the Nazis block the
	harbour entrance and the Luftwaffe
	control the skies above.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	How many of our men are trapped?
	IRONSIDE
	All of them.
	Our nation’s entire professional
	soldiery. And...
	...we can see no clear way to
	rescue them.
	WINSTON
	General--are you telling
	me that we shall have lost the
	British army by the next few days?
	IRONSIDE
	That’s correct.
	ATTLEE
	What are the French doing?
	IRONSIDE
	Premiere Raynaud sent a radio
	message. He expects the defence of
	Paris will soon fail.
	WINSTON
	We must counter-attack. Anyone?
	Surely -
	IRONSIDE
	The German forces are superior in
	every regard and are only fifty
	miles from the coast. They are
	pushing us into the sea.
	ATTLEE
	Fifty miles! Good God!
	GREENWOOD
	For a German tank, two days.
	WINSTON
	They must not reach the sea! Not
	before we evacuate our men! General
	Ismay? What have you got for us?
	ISMAY
	As it stands--I cannot see that
	we have much hope of getting any
	of our forces out in time.
	WINSTON
	Not a man? We cannot be so totally
	at their mercy!
	General. What is our next step?
	IRONSIDE
	I’m not sure, sir, that we have one.
	WINSTON
	So? So where are we to look for
	salvation?
	(silence)
	Anyone? Come on! Speak!
	IRONSIDE
	We still have a Garrison at Calais.
	25 miles to the west.
	48.
	WINSTON
	Well why didn’t you say so?! How
	many men do we have there?
	IRONSIDE
	4,000. More or less.
	WINSTON
	Then have them go east--engage with
	the German columns moving on
	Dunkirk. Buy us some time. Draw the
	Nazi focus away from Dunkirk whilst
	we execute a maritime evacuation of
	our forces. Ironside--is that
	possible?
	IRONSIDE
	It would mean a huge sacrifice.
	ATTLEE
	Four thousand young men!
	WINSTON
	To save 300,000!
	Under whose command is the Calais
	Garrison?
	ISMAY
	Brigadier Nicholson.
	WINSTON
	Very well--tell...
	...tell--Nicholson--that it is of
	the greatest importance to this
	island that his garrison draw the
	enemy’s tanks and artillery and
	bombers away from Dunkirk--invite
	their wrath--and to--to fight on if
	needs be until--until the
	destruction of his command.
	ATTLEE
	It’s suicide.
	HALIFAX
	Prime Minister! I have
	reservations...
	WINSTON
	Who is free of reservations?
	HALIFAX
	...about such a fateful course when
	we have the option of a peace offer.
	WINSTON
	What peace offer?!
	HALIFAX
	The Italians have offered to
	mediate between ourselves and
	Germany. And I indicated that
	provided our liberty and
	independence were assured, we would
	consider any proposal.
	WINSTON
	With Hitler holding the whip hand
	do you really think he would honour
	our liberty and independence?
	HALIFAX
	It would be in his interest to do
	so. He -
	WINSTON
	The only thing to do is to show
	that maniac that he cannot conquer
	this country, and for that we need
	an army. General, tell Brigadier
	Nicholson, “The Germans must not
	reach the sea! Not before we get
	our boys off that bloody beach!” (pause)
	I take full responsibility.
	HALIFAX
	Really?
	WINSTON
	ReallY! YES! It is the reason I sit
	in this chair!
	HALIFAX
	Surely--before we send 4,000 men to
	their graves, we must explore -
	WINSTON
	What is this?!
	HALIFAX
	What is your mind on the principle
	of peace talks? Do we take it for
	example, that you preclude yourself
	from even considering engaging in
	such negotiations?
	WINSTON
	I should like to speak to Viscount
	Halifax and Mr Chamberlain alone.
	Issue the order to the Calais
	Garrison. Confirm it has been done.
	Bridges! You too! Out! Hop it!
	HALIFAX
	Winston. We are facing certain
	defeat on land--the annihilation of
	our army--and imminent invasion!
	We must be rational!
	WINSTON
	We are a sea-going nation. Have
	been since the Bronze Age. The
	Channel is ours--our moat--our
	battlement and the German doesn’t
	recognise an expanse of water
	greater than a bloody lake! They
	have first to reach this island -
	HALIFAX
	- which will be full of terrified
	men, women and children, whom we
	have failed, despicably, in our
	duty of protection. Germany has won-
	-we are entirely defenceless -
	WINSTON
	And who’s fault is that ?!
	HALIFAX
	- facing the largest army the world
	has seen. Furthermore, once France
	falls, Germany can concentrate on
	aircraft production and they will
	then have the French fleet as well!
	What is to stop Hitler then? Words?
	Words, Winston? Words alone?
	If you will not permit any talk
	of peace then I will be forced -
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Might we not allow Edward simply to
	meet the Italian ambassador,
	Bastianini--discuss their possible
	role as mediators between us and
	Germany, and find out their price?
	WINSTON
	Bastianini? Ha! A man about whom
	we might say there is less to him
	than meets the eye.
	I remain opposed to any
	negotiations -
	CHAMBERLAIN
	- of course -
	WINSTON
	- which might lead to a derogation
	of our rights and power.
	HALIFAX
	AS DO WE ALL! There is no question
	that our sovereignty is nonnegotiable!
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Winston?
	Good. Thank you.
	WINSTON
	...but! No-one outside this room
	must ever know.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Of course.
	WINSTON
	Mr President?
	ROOSEVELT
	Winston!
	WINSTON
	How are you Franklin?
	ROOSEVELT
	Fine. Fine. How are you Prime
	Minister?
	WINSTON
	I am phoning about--about your Navy
	ships. If you were to loan us just
	50 of your older Destroyers I feel
	sure -
	ROOSEVELT
	Ah! Yes!
	53.
	WINSTON
	- even 40 would -
	ROOSEVELT (CONT'D)
	Well I -
	ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
	- I did ask around, but just not
	possible I’m afraid. The Neutrality
	Act we signed last year has tied my
	hands. Just can’t swing it. I
	tried.
	WINSTON
	Then--can I--do I have your
	permission to send an aircraft
	carrier to pick up the P-40 fighter
	planes we purchased? Mr President.
	ROOSEVELT
	You got me there again. New law--
	preventing trans-shipment of
	military equipment.
	WINSTON
	But we’ve paid for them--with the
	money we borrowed from you!
	ROOSEVELT
	So sorry, Winston.
	WINSTON
	I need not impress upon you the
	trouble faced by the Western
	Hemisphere. Without your support,
	in some fashion...
	ROOSEVELT
	I know. I know. You are on my
	mind day and night.
	Look. We could--possibly...
	WINSTON
	Mr President--we are facing the
	gravest odds!
	54.
	ROOSEVELT
	...we could take your planes to
	about a mile from the Canadian
	border--and then if you send across
	a team of horses from Canada--
	nothing motorized--then you could
	pull 'em over the border yourself.
	How does that sound?
	WINSTON
	Horses? You said “a team of
	horses”?
	ROOSEVELT
	I guess you could push ‘em
	yourself. The damn things have
	wheels. Up to you.
	We could do that.
	Prime Minister?
	WINSTON
	Anything you can do at this time
	would be welcome.
	ROOSEVELT
	Goodnight to you Winston.
	It must be late there?
	WINSTON
	In more ways than you could
	possibly know.
	WINSTON
	Get me Vice-Admiral Ramsay on one
	of these.
	STAFFER
	Admiral Ramsay?
	RAMSAY
	Huh?
	STAFFER
	It’s the Prime Minister.
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	Bertie? I hope I didn’t wake you.
	RAMSAY
	Of course not. I was just reading
	the Bible.
	WINSTON
	Exodus?
	We need to evacuate our boys,
	Bertie. The Navy is saying that
	with one cruiser and six
	destroyers, and with the Luftwaffe
	controlling the skies above, we'll
	be lucky to get 10% out. I want you
	to order an assembly of boats.
	RAMSAY
	Boats?
	56.
	WINSTON
	Yes. Civilian boats, as many as
	you can get your hands on.
	Country’s full of boats--let’s put
	‘em to use. Bertie? You there?
	RAMSAY
	Rrrr-ight.
	WINSTON
	- anyone with a pleasure craft
	bigger than 30 foot that can get to
	France. Longley's clipper,
	Fearnley's gin palace, any halfrotten fishing boat that’ll float.
	RAMSAY
	Mmmm-hmmm.
	WINSTON
	Help me stage this thing, Bertie.
	We must at least try to bring
	some of our boys home.
	RAMSAY
	I will have the BBC issue the
	order.
	WINSTON
	Oh-- Bertie--still there?
	RAMSAY
	Sir?
	WINSTON
	We need a name--for this Operation.
	WINSTON
	Good day. I’ve asked the Minister
	for War to join us.
	Obviously--we are in a dangerous
	situation. But - I am assured by
	the French Premiere that while some
	German tank units have reached the
	sea, the situation generally seems
	to be well in hand.
	GREENWOOD
	Prime Minister. You don’t believe
	that.
	ATTLEE
	France will fall.
	GREENWOOD
	Yes.
	ATTLEE
	And invasion of this island will
	follow.
	58.
	WINSTON
	What news from Calais?
	ATTLEE
	What?
	IRONSIDE
	The Garrison attacked, but was
	forced back and is now surrounded
	on all sides. They are being
	shelled and bombed mercilessly.
	Casualties are at sixty percent.
	HALIFAX
	On the question of peace talks -
	WINSTON
	- We must hold our nerve. Signal
	only that we are going to fight
	it out to the end. A peace offer
	telegraphs our weakness.
	EDEN
	Agreed.
	WINSTON
	And even if we were beaten--we
	should be no worse off than we
	should be if we were now to
	abandon the struggle.
	Let us therefore avoid being
	dragged down the slippery slope
	with talk of a negotiated peace.
	HALIFAX
	Slippery slope? The only -
	WINSTON
	-I suspect Germany and Italy -
	HALIFAX (CONT'D)
	-the only slippery slope -
	WINSTON
	-want to get us so deeply involved
	in negotiations that we should be
	unable to turn back!
	HALIFAX
	Oh nonsense! Bastianini informed me59.
	WINSTON
	The approach -
	HALIFAX
	- The only slippery slope -
	WINSTON
	WILL YOU STOP INTERRUPTING ME
	WHILE I AM INTERRUPTING YOU!?
	When I chose my War Cabinet I took
	great care to surround myself with
	old rivals. I may have overdone it.
	Viscount Halifax--the approach you
	proposed is not only futile, but
	involves us in a deadly danger.
	HALIFAX
	THE Deadly danger here is the 
	romantic fantasy of fighting to the
	end!!! What is “the end” if not
	the destruction of all?
	There is nothing heroic in going
	down fighting if it can be avoided.
	Nothing even remotely patriotic in
	death or glory if the odds are on
	the former; nothing inglorious in
	trying to shorten a war that we are
	clearly losing.
	WINSTON
	Europe is still -
	HALIFAX (CONT'D)
	Europe is lost!
	HALIFAX (CONT’D)
	And before our forces are wiped out
	completely this is the time to
	negotiate, in order to obtain the
	best conditions possible. It would
	not be in Hitler’s interests to
	insist on outrageous terms. He will
	know his own weaknesses. He will be
	reasonable.
	WINSTON
	When will the lesson be learned?
	How many more dictators must be
	wooed, appeased--Good God, given
	immense privileges, before we
	learn!--that you can’t reason
	with a tiger when your head is in
	its mouth!
	HAILFAX
	prime minister -
	Winston! Yesterday you gave
	permission for -
	WINSTON
	What permission?
	HALIFAX
	- for me to meet -
	HALIFAX (CONT’D)
	- with Bastianini -
	WINSTON
	- I sanctioned -
	WINSTON (CONT’D)
	- the theoretical exWINSTON (CONT'D)
	 -ploration -
	HALIFAX - theoretical?! -
	WINSTON
	- of what price Italy would ask. No
	more. I did not sanctionHALIFAX
	If you will not allow any further
	exploration of a peace agreement,
	then--you will have my resignation.
	WINSTON
	Don’t be absurd. I need you
	Edward. You know I do!
	61.
	HALIFAX
	I will not stand by to watch
	another generation of young men die
	at the bloody altar of your hubris!
	WINSTON
	And you would have us die as lambs!
	HALIFAX
	Was Gallipoli not enough for you?!
	WINSTON
	(angry)
	How dare you?! Our troops were
	chewing barbed wire in Flanders! I
	saw it! Opening a second front,
	outflanking the Turks, was a
	serious military idea - and it
	could’ve damn-well worked if - the
	Admirals and First Sea Lord hadn’t
	dithered away our element of
	surprise!
	HALIFAX
	The choice is yours. You have 24
	hours to enter into peace talks, or
	I resign.
	ERNLE HASTINGS
	Prime Minister. I wonder if we
	might schedule you to address the
	Outer Cabinet?
	HALIFAX
	I told him. It shook him.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Imagine it did.
	HALIFAX
	Gave him 24 hours--I don’t expect
	him to agree, so I will resign
	first. You then join me. That’s
	critical if we are to trigger a
	revolt in the chamber. I’ll
	announce it. The King will back us.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Be sure of your motives, Edward.
	Country first! Country First
	always. Career third, fourth--
	after family, and church - and,
	in your case (small smile) - fox
	hunting. Come.
	RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.) 
	“Today, the Admiralty have made an
	Order requesting all owners of selfpropelled pleasure craft, between
	30' and 100' in length, to send all
	particulars to the Admiralty,
	immediately -
	RADIO ANNOUNCER
	“- if they have not already been
	offered or requisitioned.“
	CHURCHILL
	To Brigadier Nicholson, 30th
	Infantry Brigade. Calais.
	Every hour you continue to exist
	is of the greatest help to our
	forces at Dunkirk. Have the
	greatest possible admiration for
	your splendid stand.
	Your evacuation however--your
	evacuation will not, repeat not,
	take place.
	Signed...
	Here.
	What is it?
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	May I be excused?
	CHURCHILL
	You may not. Tell me what this
	is about.
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	No-one tells us anything. It’s all
	classified and--we hear scraps and
	it’s worse than knowing nothing.
	CHURCHILL
	What would you like to know?
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	How many men will survive?
	CHURCHILL
	Come with me. Come on.
	CHURCHILL
	Come in.
	ELIZABETH
	No. I’m not allowed in the Map
	Room.
	CHURCHILL
	WINSTON
	The German army now controls
	every French port except Dunkirk,
	here--and Calais, here to the west,
	where a garrison is drawing fire
	and delaying the German advance on
	Dunkirk.
	WINSTON (CONT’D)
	At both points our troops are
	encircled. We’re still trying to
	clear Dunkirk harbour of wrecked
	ships so we can then land the boats
	we need to get our boys off those
	beaches, but enemy planes are
	attacking us constantly. Our only
	hope in Dunkirk is thick cloud
	cover to thwart these attacks, but--
	the skies remain clear. Even then I
	am told we will need a miracle to
	get even 10% of our men out.
	Courage, Miss Layton--courage.
	ELIZABETH
	How long have they got if we don’t
	rescue them?
	WINSTON
	One, maybe two days.
	General?
	ISMAY
	News from Calais, the 30th
	Infantry, sir. They’ve retreated to
	the town’s citadel...
	As a last and probably hopeless
	stand-the order “Everyman for
	himself’ has been given.
	WINSTON
	Good.
	ISMAY (O.S.)
	... as a last, and probably
	hopeless, stand. The order, ‘every
	man for himself’ has been given.
	CLEMMIE
	Go to bed, Pig.
	You must sleep.
	WINSTON
	Leave me, Clemmie.
	CLEMMIE
	The opportunity for doing so
	passed a long time ago.
	WINSTON
	Bertie--what’s been the response?
	ADMIRAL RAMSAY
	It will take time. It’s too soon
	to judge.
	WINSTON
	How many boats so far?
	ADMIRAL RAMSAY
	It will take time.
	WINSTON
	The request for civilian boats
	was not a request, Bertie.
	It was an order!
	GEORGE VI
	How do you manage drinking during
	the day?
	WINSTON
	Practice.
	GEORGE VI
	I have been asked--if plans should
	be drawn--to evacuate my f-family
	and I--to Canada. I wish to know
	the opinion of our prime minister.
	WINSTON
	My opinion? My opinion would be
	that you must do what you feel is
	right for yourself, your family,
	and for the country. Your survival
	is paramount. Prime Ministers--we
	seem to come and go at an
	astonishing rate.
	GEORGE VI
	Your--p-position in parliament,
	I hear, is not strong.
	WINSTON
	My party resents how Chamberlain
	was pushed aside. And many others
	doubt me. I was not a popular
	choice.
	They want Halifax still. But why
	get rid of the organ grinder and
	replace him with the monkey.
	GEORGE VI
	Lord Halifax is a close personal
	friend of mine!
	WINSTON
	I am unwanted. I’ve never been
	trusted since the Gallipoli
	campaign. Unwanted.
	GEORGE VI
	Perhaps--it is because--you scare
	people.
	WINSTON
	Who?!
	GEORGE VI
	You scare me.
	WINSTON
	What?! What nonsense!
	What could be scary about me?
	GEORGE VI
	One never knows what is going to
	come out of your mouth next.
	Something that w-will flatter--
	or wound.
	WINSTON
	My emotions are unbridled.
	A wildness. In the blood. I share
	it with my father.
	Mother also. We lack the gift of--
	temperance.
	GEORGE VI
	Were you close--to your parents?
	WINSTON
	My mother was glamorous--but
	perhaps too widely loved.
	My father--to me was like God--
	busy elsewhere.
	WINSTON
	Miss Layton.
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	Sir.
	WINSTON
	Reach--I need to reach--speak to...
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	To?
	WINSTON
	3pm.
	ELIZABETH LAYTON
	3pm, sir?
	WINSTON
	Ask Bridges to summon the--the uh--
	the War Cabinet for 3pm. Thank you.
	JOHN EVANS
	Sir!
	WINSTON
	What is it?
	JOHN EVANS
	Sir-from Lord Gort, in France.
	WINSTON
	Belgium has fallen. They will
	surrender at midnight. France
	will soon follow suit.
	IRONSIDE
	We have received reports that the
	most probable method of attack,
	which Germany might employ against
	this country, is a large fleet of
	fast motor boats, possibly up to
	200, carrying 100 men apiece to
	carry out a seaborne raid on a
	large scale. By this means a
	considerable force of the enemy
	could be landed at many points on
	the coast simultaneously with airborne raids inland. We do not feel
	that by naval or air action we
	could prevent such a landing.
	HALIFAX
	Could you repeat that?
	IRONSIDE
	We must prepare for the imminent
	invasion of our island.
	HALIFAX
	Let the record state--that I have
	received word from the Italian
	Embassy in London that Italy is
	prepared to mediate a resolution
	between Britain, its Allies, and
	Germany.
	WINSTON
	Perhaps--then--
	--the time for such an offer from
	us is -
	- is when Germany has made an
	unsuccessful attempt to invade this
	country.
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Unsuccessful?!
	HALIFAX
	Then you leave me no other option -
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Winston--you are refusing to grasp
	the realities of how precarious our
	position is! Our entire army is
	about to be wiped out! Terms!
	Must! Be struck!
	WINSTON
	Anthony?
	Then...
	Then it seems...
	...we have no choice but to at least
	consider the path of negotiation.
	If Hitler’s peace terms are--
	overlordship of Central Europe and
	return of certain German colonies -
	(pause)
	- and if he will leave us our
	independence, then - then I would
	be thankful to get out of our
	present difficulties. It’s quite
	unlikely that he will make any such
	offer, but...
	...if I were told what the German
	terms were, then--I would be--
	prepared---to--to consider them.
	HALIFAX
	Thank you. Prime Minister.
	I shall prepare a draft memorandum
	at once.
	MILES ALDRIDGE
	Mr. Churchill! One picture, one
	picture, come on sir, one picture!
	How about a smile, Prime Minister?
	GEORGE VI
	I was--ju--just imagining never
	standing--here again. Perhaps
	because I am no longer alive, or--
	or because the palace itself-- is
	gone.
	EQUERRY
	Canada. You must decide, sir. You
	could rule in exile.
	GEORGE VI
	Truly? Is that my fate?
	You know what? I feel angry. In
	this moment I’m aware of feeling--
	bloody angry.
	WINSTON
	I have...come to...to
	wonder...in... recent
	days...whether it was...my duty...
	- to consider...
	...consider...entering...
	JOHN EVANS
	Will that be all for tonight, sir?
	WINSTON
	...entering into negotiations
	with...
	...that...corporal...no...
	...gangster--no--tyrant...
	...monster of wickedness, no...
	...butcher--no good--monstrous
	savage?--bloodthirsty guttersnipe!--
	housepainter... (throws newspaper on the
	ground)
	HOUSEPAINTER!
	Where were we? Where - ?
	Well?
	ELIZABETH
	I didn’t understand you, sir.
	He doesn’t reply. She finally adds -
	ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
	You were -
	WINSTON
	Were?
	ELIZABETH
	You were - mumbling.
	WINSTON
	Mumbling.
	ELIZABETH
	Yes sir.
	WINSTON
	Your beau?
	ELIZABETH
	My brother.
	WINSTON
	Where is he now?
	ELIZABETH
	He was falling back on Dunkirk but
	he never made it.
	What?
	His eyes moisten - at all she represents, innocence and loss
	and courage and purity.
	WINSTON
	I’m just looking at you.
	ELIZABETH
	Shall I read back what we have?
	WINSTON
	Please.
	ELIZABETH
	“I have come to wonder in recent
	days whether it was my duty to
	consider entering into negotiations-
	-with...”
	WINSTON
	With...
	WINSTON (O.S.)
	...with...
	CLEMMIE
	Darling, Winston, Darling?
	WINSTON
	i -
	CLEMMIE
	Shhh. Shhh. You’ve the full weight
	of the world on your shoulders. But
	these inner battles, darling -
	77.
	WINSTON
	I can’t -
	CLEMMIE
	- I know, I know - but they have
	actually trained you for this
	moment. You are strong because you
	are imperfect. You are wise because
	you have doubts. From this
	uncertainty the wisest words will
	come. Now. I will let him in.
	WINSTON
	Who?
	CLEMMIE
	The King.
	WINSTON
	Which King? Our King?
	CLEMMIE
	Well if it isn’t him, it’s a
	wonderful impersonation.
	KING GEORGE VI
	Mr Churchill--I hope you can for--
	give the late hour but your wife
	thought tonight would be a good
	time.
	WINSTON
	Something to drink? Er -
	KING GEORGE VI
	No, thank you.
	I received a visit...
	WINSTON
	From?
	KING GEORGE VI
	Viscount Halifax.
	It appears--the prospect of a peace
	deal with Hitler--has increased
	dramatically.
	WINSTON
	Later today I will address The
	House. The war cabinet is drafting
	a letter to Mussolini, asking him
	to broker talks with Herr Hitler.
	GEORGE VI
	Then Halifax was correct.
	WINSTON
	I should like to know your mind.
	GEORGE VI
	It would be helpful to know yours
	first.
	WINSTON
	Mine? I should like to know it
	myself.
	Nations which go down fighting rise
	again, but those which surrender
	tamely are finished.
	GEORGE VI
	Belgium?
	WINSTON
	Collapsed.
	GEORGE VI
	Norway -
	WINSTON
	Holland. France any hour.
	GEORGE VI
	And the mood of parliament?
	WINSTON
	Fear. Panic.
	GEORGE VI
	And are you not afraid? At all?
	79.
	WINSTON
	I am most terribly.
	Our defeat in France is the most
	crushing in the history of the
	Empire. Support among my party for
	a campaign of resistance has
	collapsed.
	GEORGE VI
	You have my support.
	WINSTON
	Your Majesty?
	GEORGE VI
	You have my support.
	I must confess, I had some
	reservations about you at-at first.
	And while some in this country
	might have dreaded your
	appointment, none dreaded it likelike Adolph Hitler.
	Whomever can strike fear into that
	brute heart is worthy of all our
	trust. We shall work together. You
	shall have my support. At any hour.
	(passionate)
	Beat the buggers.
	WINSTON
	I fear I may be defeated.
	GEORGE VI
	You--you once gave me some advice.
	Perhaps I can give you some. Go to
	the people. Let them instruct you.
	Quite silently, they usually do.
	But tell them the truth.
	Unvarnished.
	WINSTON
	I shall speak to parliament, but
	without support in my own party, I
	must sue for peace.
	GEORGE VI
	You warned us this day was coming.
	We failed to listen to you. Lift us
	up, Mr Churchill.
	WINSTON
	On certain matters I have few
	people with whom I can talk
	frankly.
	GEORGE VI
	Perhaps now we have each other?
	WINSTON
	I no longer scare you?
	GEORGE VI
	Only a little. I can cope.
	WINSTON
	Yes you can. Your majesty.
	RAMSAY
	We are ready. More or less.
	WINSTON
	More or less what, Bertie?
	Give me a number!
	RAMSAY
	In total--860 vessels. The biggest
	civilian fleet ever assembled.
	WINSTON
	May God watch over them all.
	RAMSAY
	Operation Dynamo waits upon
	your command...
	WINSTON
	Admiral--you may initiate Dynamo.
	BRIDGES
	We’ve lost the Prime Minister!
	WINSTON
	Do you know how to use this thing?
	TEENAGE GIRL
	Yes -
	- yes sir.
	WINSTON
	So--tell me--how do I get to
	Westminster?
	TEENAGE GIRL
	Westminster? Um, the District Line.
	East. One stop.
	WINSTON
	District Line. East. One stop.
	Doesn’t sound so hard.
	TEENAGE GIRL
	No, sir.
	WINSTON
	So--this is the Underground!
	WINSTON
	What are you all staring at? Have
	you never seen a Prime Minister
	ride on the Underground before.
	Thank you.
	What is your name?
	OLD MAN
	Oliver Wilson, sir.
	WINSTON
	And what do you do Mr Wilson?
	OLD MAN
	Brick-layer, sir.
	WINSTON
	Good!
	We shall have great need of bricklayers soon! Business will be
	looking up!
	Progress!
	How old?
	WOMAN WITH BABY
	Eight months, sir. He looks like
	you.
	WINSTON
	Madam, all babies look like me.
	WOMAN WITH BABY
	Mrs Jessie Sutton.
	YOUNG WOMAN
	Abigail Walker.
	WEST-INDIAN MAN
	Marcus Peters.
	YOUNG IRISH WOMAN
	Agnes Dillon.
	YOUNG MAN
	Maurice Baker.
	MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
	Alice Simpson.
	MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
	Miss Margaret Jerome.
	WINSTON
	My mother was a Jerome--I expect we
	are closely related!
	And how are you all bearing up?
	Of good spirits? Just as well!
	We will need them!
	Now let me ask you all something--
	which has been weighing on my mind.
	Perhaps you can provide me with an
	answer.
	The British people. What is their
	mood? Is it confident?
	YOUNG MAN
	Very.
	OLD MAN
	Some people say it’s a lost cause.
	WINSTON
	Lost causes are the only ones worth
	fighting for. Now let me ask you
	this--if the worst came to pass,
	and the enemy were to appear on
	these streets, what would you do?
	YOUNG MAN
	Fight.
	MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
	Fight the fascists!
	OLD MAN
	Fight them with whatever we can lay
	our hands on!
	IRISH WOMAN
	Broom handles if we must!
	YOUNG WOMAN
	Street by street!
	WEST-INDIAN MAN
	They'll never take Picadilly!
	WINSTON
	Ha!Ha! Never Picadilly indeed!
	And what--what if I put it to you
	all--that we might - if we ask
	nicely - receive very favourable
	terms from Mr. Hitler if we enter
	into a peace deal with him right
	now? What would you say to that?
	ALL
	Never! Never!
	Never! Never!
	YOUNG GIRL
	Never!
	WINSTON
	Will you never give up?
	YOUNG GIRL
	Never.
	WINSTON
	“Then out spake brave Horatius,
	The Captain of the gate:
	To every man upon this earth
	Death cometh soon or late.
	And how can man die better
	Than facing fearful odds - “
	WEST INDIAN MAN
	“- for the ashes of his fathers
	And the temples of his gods.”
	YOUNG GIRL
	Are you crying?
	WINSTON
	I blub a lot. You’ll have
	to get used to it.
	What stop is this?
	MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
	Westminster.
	WINSTON
	That’s my stop.
	HALIFAX
	The Memorandum--titled “Suggested
	Approaches to Italy”--is as
	follows...
	CADOGAN
	“If Signor Mussolini will cooperate with us in securing a
	settlement of all European
	questions which safeguard the
	independence and security of the
	allies...”
	CADOGAN (O.S.)
	“...and could be the basis of a
	just and durable peace for Europe,
	we will undertake at once to
	discuss, with the desire to find
	solutions, the matters in which
	Signor Mussolini is primarily
	interested...”
	CADOGAN ((O.S.)
	..”We understand that he desires
	the solution of certain
	Mediterranean questions: and if he
	will state in secrecy what these
	are, France and Great Britain will
	at once do their best to meet those
	wishes”.
	JOHN EVANS
	Sir! The War Cabinet is waiting!
	WINSTON
	I am due to address the Outer
	Cabinet. I haven’t spoken to them
	since the formation of the new
	government.
	Good day.
	I am--about to speak to my Outer
	Cabinet in my rooms and--I extend
	the invitation to any of you who
	would care to join them.
	WINSTON
	Later today--I will address the
	House on the matter of our nation’s
	security.
	At this very moment the War Cabinet
	is drafting papers that lay out our
	willingness to enter into peace
	talks with Herr Hitler, via his
	lacky, Signor Mussolini.
	I have thought carefully in these
	last days--whether -
	-whether it was part of my duty--
	to consider entering into
	negotiations with -
	- that Man.
	But then I spoke--with Oliver
	Wilson -
	- Mrs Jessie Sutton, Mrs Abigail
	Walker...
	...Marcus Peters, Agnes Dillon,
	Maurice Baker, Alice Simpson, and
	Miss Margaret Jerome--brave, good,
	true citizens of this kingdom--and
	they argued, strongly, that it was
	idle to think that, if we tried to
	make peace now, we should get
	better terms than if we fought it
	out. The Germans, Mr Baker felt,
	would demand - in the name of
	disarmament - our naval bases, and
	much else. And I think he’s right.
	Jessie Sutton, speaking for many,
	believes we should then become a
	slave state, though a British
	Government - which would be
	Hitler's puppet - would be set up -
	under Mosley or some such person.
	90.
	ERNLE HASTINGS
	No!
	WINSTON
	And I join with them in asking a
	further question, a question I put
	to you: where should we be at the
	end of all that?
	Perhaps some might benefit--the
	powerful might be able to parlay
	good terms--preserved in their
	country redoubts, out of sight of
	the Swastika flying on Buckingham
	Palace, over Windsor, draped on
	these very buildings -
	BACK-BENCHER 1
	Never!
	WINSTON
	So I come to you--to learn your
	minds in this grave hour.
	You see, we do still have immense
	reserves and advantages...
	...and it was pointed out to me -
	(holding up list of names
	from Underground)
	- by my new friends--that you might
	even rise up and tear me down were
	I for one moment to contemplate
	parley or surrender.
	Were they wrong?
	ALL
	No! No!
	WINSTON
	Then...then...then -
	- then--it appears to be your will
	also, that if this long island
	story of ours is to end at last,
	then it should only be -
	- when each one of us lies choking
	in his own blood upon the ground!
	WINSTON
	And when I asked to know their
	minds there occurred a
	demonstration which, considering
	the character of the gathering,
	quite surprised me. There is no
	doubt that if we falter at all in
	the leading of the nation we
	should all be hurled out of office.
	I am sure now that every Minister on
	both sides of the house is ready to
	be killed quite soon, and have all
	his family and possessions
	destroyed, rather than give in. In
	this they represent almost all the
	people. It falls to me in these
	coming days and months to express
	their sentiments. There shall be no
	negotiated peace...
	..and you must each do now as you
	see fit.
	I must now address parliament, and
	I’m yet to write a word of my
	speech.
	“Tiny”.
	IRONSIDE
	Sir.
	WINSTON
	Miss Layton?
	ELIZABETH
	Sir?
	WINSTON
	I’m in need of you.
	HALIFAX
	We must both now resign. Force a
	vote of no confidence. I have your
	word?
	CHAMBERLAIN
	Let us--let us go to the Commons
	first. Join our colleagues. And
	speak after the Prime Minister’s
	address.
	CLEMMIE
	Here lies a woman, who is always
	tired--for she lived in a world
	where too much was required.
	WINSTON
	Turning once again--to the question
	of invasion--I would observe that
	there has never been a period in
	all these long centuries of which
	we boast, when an absolute
	guarantee against invasion could
	have been given to our people.
	I have, myself--full confidence
	that if all do their duty, if
	nothing is neglected, and if the
	best arrangements are made, as they
	are being made, we shall prove
	ourselves once more able to defend
	our island home, to ride out the
	storm of war, and to outlive the
	menace of tyranny -
	WINSTON
	- if necessary for years, if
	necessary alone. At any rate, that
	is what we are going to try to do.
	That is the resolve of His
	Majesty's Government – every man of
	them. That is the will of
	Parliament and the nation.
	The British Empire and the French
	Republic, linked together in their
	cause and in their need, will
	defend to the death their native
	soil, aiding each other like good
	comrades to the utmost of their
	strength.
	Even though large tracts of Europe
	and many old and famous States have
	fallen or may fall into the grip of
	the Gestapo and all the odious
	apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall
	not flag or fail.
	We shall go on to the end.
	We shall fight in France--we shall
	fight on the seas and oceans, we
	shall fight with growing confidence
	and growing strength in the air, we
	shall defend our island - whatever
	the cost may be. We shall fight on
	the beaches, we shall fight on the
	landing grounds, we shall fight in
	the fields and in the streets, we
	shall fight in the hills; We shall
	never surrender, and if, which I do
	not for a moment believe, this
	island or a large part of it were
	subjugated and starving, then our
	Empire beyond the seas, armed and
	guarded by the British Fleet, would
	carry on the struggle, until, in
	God's good time, the New World,
	with all its power and might, steps
	forth to the rescue and the
	liberation of the old!
	EDEN
	Changed your mind?
	WINSTON
	Those who never change their mind
	never change anything.
	STANHOPE
	What just happened?
	HALIFAX
	He just mobilized the English
	language--and sent it into battle.
