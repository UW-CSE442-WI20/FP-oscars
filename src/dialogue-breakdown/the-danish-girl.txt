WOMAN
Don't you wish you could paint like
GERDA
I’m sorry...?
OLDER WOMAN
I said, don't you wish you could
paint like your husband? Really - you must
be so proud...
RASMUSSEN
They’re all Veijle, where he grew
up.
And I don't say my client is
the best landscape artist in
Denmark... but, he is in the top
one!
ULLA
It’s going very well.
GERDA
Oh yes. He’ll be impossible.
And Rasmussen...
EINAR
Oh, come on. Be kind.
At least he agreed to see your work.
GERDA
Only because he was drunk!
EINAR
I know.
GERDA
You were loving it!
EINAR
I was not.
GERDA
“I don’t say my client is the best
landscape artist in Denmark...”
EINAR
“But...”
GERDA
“He is in the top one!”
MAN
Hey - people are sleeping!
GERDA
Do you know what time it is?
EINAR
Time you came back to bed?
GERDA
No - I’m ready to start work.
EINAR
Draw down the blinds.
GERDA
I told you, I...
EINAR
Gerda...
GERDA
What?
GERDA
Your face... You think I can’t resist
you...
EINAR
Do you want to resist me?
GERDA
No. But I’d like you to ask nicely
so I don’t feel such a pushover...
EINAR
Gerda Wegener - my life, my wife...
EINAR
Thorbjorn.
DOORMAN
Mr Wegener.
ULLA
Tighter!
Einar Wegener!
Oh don’t worry about him - he’s only ever
had eyes for one woman.
EINAR
My guilty secret’s out.
ULLA
So - when are you two going to breed me a
godchild?
EINAR
You’re an atheist.
ULLA
I’ll reconsider.
EINAR
We’re trying.
ULLA
Try harder. I’ve been waiting an eternity.
Have you tried drinking raw eggs?
EINAR
No.
ULLA
Do it. For my sake.
Anyway what are you doing in today? I
thought you finished last week?
EINAR
I wanted to check on the scrim for the
storm scene. And give Gerda some space.
ULLA
Ah - she’s got a shy one.
You know I’m next?
EINAR
So I heard.
ULLA
I won’t be shy.
EINAR
I should imagine not.
ULLA
Good God, she’ll need all her colours for
me!
FONNESBECH
I wanted to say... I appreciate our being
alone today. I hope your husband doesn’t
mind.
GERDA
Not at all. I could see his being here
made you uncomfortable.
FONNESBECH
It wasn’t personal.
GERDA
It’s not uncommon.
FONNESBECH
Ah.
GERDA
It’s hard for a man to be looked at by a
woman. Women are used to it, of course,
but for a man...
To... submit to a woman’s gaze. It’s
unsettling...
Although I believe there’s some pleasure to
be had from it, once you...
...yield.
Sit!
Good girl.
Well?
EINAR
Perfect. Almost.
Good luck...
RASMUSSEN
All portraits...
GERDA
Is that bad?
RASMUSSEN
Not per se, but... this kind of work is not
really my...
Gerda... I don’t think it would benefit
either of us to show these.
It’s not a judgement on your abilities - I
agree with Einar: you could be a first
class painter if you found the right
subject matter.
EINAR
How was it?
GERDA
Fine.
EINAR
I finally mixed the right colour for the
snow.
GERDA
Another view of Vejle. I don’t know how
you can paint the same thing over and over.
EINAR
I suppose I just haven’t finished with it
yet.
Gerda..?
GERDA
Could you please not speak to Rasmussen
about me again... My work is my business.
Stay out of it.
I have my period.
EINAR
I’m sorry.
GERDA
Are you?
EINAR
Of course I am... You know I am.
GERDA
Could you help me with something?
EINAR
Anything.
GERDA
Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled
again. Would you try on her stockings and
shoes?
GERDA
I’m just so behind. I don’t know how I’ll
be finished in time for her opening...
EINAR
I’ll do it. It’s fine.
No... no, not now Hvappe...
He almost snagged this...
GERDA
Hvappe...
That’s backwards...
EINAR
I saw these in the window of
Fonnesbech’s...
GERDA
Smart aren’t they?
EINAR
I don’t think they’ll fit...
GERDA
Well just do what you can.
No. I need the dress.
EINAR
Gerda, I’m not putting it on.
GERDA
I haven’t asked you to.
Would you just relax...? The sooner I
start, the sooner I finish.
ULLA
Well hello, there!
Oh, don’t worry my darling...
We’re going to call you Lili...
GERDA
Such concentration. Sometimes when you’re
working, I think you’re going to slip
through the surface of the painting and
vanish.
Sink into the bog. Like your friend’s kite
when you were a boy.
EINAR
Hans. It was Hans’ kite I crashed.
Poor Hans. He was so proud of it...
I couldn’t believe he even let me
have a turn...
GERDA
He’s probably still sitting on a
rock, sobbing his heart out.
EINAR
He’s a dealer in Paris, peddling
Old Masters to rich Americans.
GERDA
Oh. So we don’t need to worry
about Hans.
EINAR
No we don’t.
GERDA
I didn’t mean to disturb you.
EINAR
That’s okay. I’ve finished.
And don’t worry, I won’t disappear into the
bog.
The bog is in me, silly.
GERDA
What?
EINAR
Can’t a man watch his wife get undressed?
That slip is new...
GERDA
You’re very observant.
EINAR
Leave it on...
It’s very pretty...
GERDA
I might let you borrow it.
EINAR
I might enjoy that.
GERDA
Oh really...? Is there something you’d like
to tell me?
EINAR
Why...? Is there something you’d like to
know...?
GERDA
No... I’m your wife. I know everything.
Both of them...?
ULLA
And at the same time!
Married people are so delightfully easy to
shock.
EINAR
We just pretend to be shocked because it
encourages you.
ULLA
I know. That’s why you’re the only
couple in my party for the Artists
Ball...
EINAR
Out of the question.
ULLA
Oh, I know Einar hates it, but he’ll have
to bear with us.
EINAR
She can go without me.
ULLA
Gerda without an escort? It would be a
scandal.
EINAR
Gerda loves a scandal.
GERDA
You’ve had too much champagne.
EINAR
Look at the way she dresses, flaunting her
ankles. An invitation to corruption.
GERDA
I don’t think anyone is likely to be
corrupted by seeing my ankles.
EINAR
I was.
The first time we met, I was leaving the
Academy, and she was on the steps,
flaunting said ankles... And she
propositioned me!
ELSA
Is that true?!
GERDA
It was a dare. But when I said hello to
him, he actually blushed! He was so shy! So
I asked him out.
ULLA
And you said yes -
EINAR
She made me. She seemed so sure.
GERDA
I was sure. I still am.
NIELS
Oh please - enough!
ELSA
No - what was it about him?
GERDA
I don’t know...
But we went for coffee, and after, I kissed
him... and it was the strangest thing... it
was like kissing myself.
ULLA
Well these two won’t be staying much
longer...
EINAR
Unmarried people are so delightfully easy
to shock.
GERDA
Turn it back on.
Were you really corrupted by my ankles?
EINAR
You were shameless.
GERDA
I still am.
EINAR
Beautiful shameless Gerda...
GERDA
Did I wake you?
Sorry... I couldn’t sleep.
EINAR
Why?
GERDA
Wondering about things.
EINAR
What things?
GERDA
Wondering if we made a baby last night.
EINAR
What d’you think?
GERDA
Wondering when you got so pretty.
EINAR
Oh, I was always pretty, you just never
noticed.
GERDA
Hello...?
EINAR
In here...
These are good.
GERDA
Do you think?
Well thank you. Thank you.
I had coffee with Ulla. She asked
about the Artists’ Ball.
Don’t worry - I told her no.
EINAR
You should go, you enjoy it.
GERDA
With you I enjoy it.
EINAR
Look - it’s good to be seen at those
things. I understand that.
GERDA
And that’s why you hate them.
EINAR
I feel as though I’m performing myself.
GERDA
Giving them your Einar Wegener.
Why not give them something different, go
as someone else?
EINAR
Did you have someone in particular in mind?
No - that’s outrageous!
GERDA
You’d be very convincing... You might even
enjoy it...
GERDA
You’ll have to shave closer.
Close your eyes... This is hard on someone
else...
EINAR
Here...
How’s that?
GERDA
Better than I ever manage.
Oh, Lili! I want to sketch you...
Sit!
EINAR
Come on, Hvap!
GERDA
Knee over... head up.. Look at
those hands... relax...
No, don’t make her a slut!
EINAR
It’s your fault, you excite her.
Gerda gets close to pin him still. His face closes on hers.
GERDA
Why, Miss Lili, you are forward...
EINAR
You have no idea...
43 Morning, Thorbjorn... 43
DOORMAN
Good morning.
EINAR
I wondered where you were, it’s getting
late.
GERDA
We have plenty of time. I bought these...
Einar, are you sure about tonight?
What is it...?
EINAR
Am I pretty enough?
GERDA
Of course you are...
EINAR
I’ll never be as pretty as you.
ULLA
My darling!
GERDA
Ulla, let me introduce...
ULLA
It’s Lili...!
GERDA
That’s right. Einar’s cousin from
Vejle...
ULLA
My dear, you’re exquisite...
In - let’s go in...
LILI
You won’t leave me, will you...?
GERDA
No. No, never.
LILI
People are looking.
GERDA
Well you’re a pretty girl, you’ll
have to get used to that.
It’s fine. You’re just feeling
self-conscious.
ELSA
Gerda - !
LILI
Go and talk to her...
GERDA
No, I’ll stay with you...
EINAR/LILI
Go. I’ll be fine. Go before she
comes over here...
HENRIK
Are you a reporter?
LILI
No.
HENRIK
A poetess...?
Do you know the story of this oak
tree?
LILI
Mm...?
HENRIK
They say if you eat its acorns you
can make a wish and become anyone
you want for a day.
EINAR/LILI
Why would they say that...?
HENRIK
Henrik Sandahl. At your disposal.
LILI
Lili...
HENRIK
Are you here with someone, Lili?
LILI
Yes - my cousin’s wife.
HENRIK
Who’s your cousin?
LILI
Einar Wegener. He’s a painter.
HENRIK
Rather a good one. Better than
most people think.
LILI
Is that right?
HENRIK
Most people our age at any rate.
LILI
Well....
HENRIK
Don’t go back in. It’s cooler
here. Besides, I’m a romantic.
LILI
Oh really...
HENRIK
I prefer the shadows and...
I don’t mean to presume, but I’ve
been watching you.
I think you might be the same.
GERDA
Have you seen Einar? I can’t find
him.
ULLA
Of course you can’t, he isn’t here!
HENRIK
You’re different from other girls.
LILI
That’s not a very original line.
HENRIK
It’s true. You’re old fashioned.
LILI
Provincial. I’m new to the city.
HENRIK
No, it’s more than that. I feel
I’d need to ask permission before I
kissed you.
LILI
I probably ought to find Gerda.
HENRIK
Why don’t you tell her I’ll walk
you home...?
LILI
She wouldn’t like that...
HENRIK
Lili...
LILI
Einar might be waiting up... he
wouldn’t like this...
HENRIK
Wouldn’t he...?
LILI
No...
HENRIK
Lili...
Lili... Lili.
LILI
You didn’t ask permission...
HENRIK
I couldn’t risk you saying no.
What’s happened..? Let me...
I’m sorry I don’t know what...
GERDA
Quickly, lean on me...
How are you...?
EINAR
You were late home last night, I
thought I’d let you sleep. How was
it? Did Lili have fun?
GERDA
I think it would be better if Lili
didn’t come here again.
EINAR
Fine. I understand.
GERDA
You know what I would like to
understand?
Exactly what happened between you
and Sandahl last night?
EINAR
Nothing.
It was nothing.
GERDA
Did he know it was you?
EINAR
It wasn’t as simple as that. It’s
hard to explain...
GERDA
I watched him kiss you, Einar, so
could you please make an effort?!
EINAR
He may have known who I was. But I
wasn’t always... me. There was a
moment when I was... just Lili.
And I think he could see that. Do
you see?
GERDA
But Lili doesn’t exist. We made
her up.
EINAR
I know...
GERDA
We were playing a game!
EINAR
I know we were... but then it
changed...
GERDA
This is absurd. We need to stop.
Make it stop Einar.
EINAR
I’m going to try...
GERDA
Another headache?
EINAR
It’s nothing...
GERDA
Can I get you something?
EINAR
I’m fine.
GERDA
Maybe you should see a doctor.
EINAR
Gerda... I’m fine.
HENRIK
I didn’t think you’d come.
Lili settles in her seat.
LILI
No. Nor did I.
GERDA
I thought you might not come back.
EINAR
That’s absurd...
GERDA
Is it?
MAN
RASMUSSEN
I just... I don’t know...
The model...?
GERDA
Einar’s cousin.
RASMUSSEN
Yes, the resemblance is...
Are there others...?
GERDA
A series back at the studio.
RASMUSSEN
These are different... For these, I don’t
know... there may be a market.
GERDA
You’re taking them.
RASMUSSEN
Well, yes...
HENRIK
Come in...
LILI
I don’t have long... Gerda’s seeing
Rasmussen.
HENRIK
I don’t like all these lies.
LILI
She’s very protective.
HENRIK
Why don’t you just tell her about
us?
LILI
I couldn’t do that...
HENRIK
Sorry - I don’t want to upset you.
Come here...
LILI
No... Henrik...
HENRIK
Yes...
LILI
No...
HENRIK
Einar...
LILI
What...?
HENRIK
Come on... it’s alright...
LILI
I’m sorry, I don’t understand...
HENRIK
Einar... please...
LILI
I don’t know what you mean... I don’t know
what you want...
HENRIK
I want you!
LILI
No...
HENRIK
Yes... wait... Wait! Lili... Lili, come
back...
GERDA
Are you alright...?
Lili reaches out her hand and Gerda takes it...
LILI
No...
I’ve been seeing Henrik Sandahl.
EINAR
I thought perhaps you knew.
GERDA
No.
EINAR
You always seemed to know everything.
GERDA
Not this.
So... are you in love with Sandahl?
EINAR
No - I love you, Gerda, only you. But
Lili...
GERDA
Why can’t you just be honest about this!
EINAR
I’m trying! Gerda... please... I
need you to believe me. You of all
people to understand.
GERDA
Okay, I need you to tell me... when Henrik
and ‘Lili’ are together, they what...? They
kiss - we know that...
Has it gone beyond that?
EINAR
No... No, Lili’s never gone further than
that with a man. She... she wouldn’t...
GERDA
There have been other men?
EINAR
There was another, but it was a long time
ago.
That boy Hans... back in Vejle.
Lili fell for him. And he kissed her. Just
once.
But my father came in and he caught them...
He knocked Hans down - he was so angry...
GERDA
I don’t know what to say.
What...?
EINAR
I’m so sorry...
I’m so sorry... I’m not feeling
well.
GERDA
Einar... what is this? What’s happening...
Einar... Einar...?
HEXLER
So, you saw Dr Andersen after a
bout of severe nosebleeds, which
you have come to believe coincide
with your stomach cramps, and on a
monthly basis.
How long have you been married?
EINAR
Six years.
HEXLER
Children?
EINAR
No.
HEXLER
Is there regular copulation?
EINAR
Yes. Perhaps less now than...
HEXLER
Than before you started to dress as a
woman?
Mr Wegener I’m a specialist. You
may be embarrassed - I am not.
So. Tell me about Lili. Where
does she come from?
EINAR
Inside me.
HEXLER
You know the most likely
explanation for all this is a
chemical imbalance?
EINAR
Really...?
HEXLER
Onto the bed.
That would explain the pain, the
confused state of masculinity and
the infertility. Let’s hope it is
that, because that we can cure.
EINAR
I don’t need to do this... There’s
nothing wrong with me..
GERDA
Einar, that’s not true.
EINAR
This can’t be right...
HEXLER
Radiation is a miracle, Mr Wegener:
it destroys the bad and saves the
good.
GERDA
He says it will be over very
quickly...
HEXLER
Lie still, Mr Wegener...
Mr Wegener...?
How are you feeling this morning?
EINAR
You’ve hurt Lili...
HEXLER
I’m afraid your husband’s aberrant thinking
persists. Do you keep a lock on your
wardrobe?
GERDA
Of course not.
HEXLER
Mrs Wegener, you haven’t been encouraging
this delusion? You do understand that your
husband’s insane?
GERDA
No, that’s not true...
We trusted you, we came to you for help...
I won’t be long.
EINAR
Don’t worry about me, I’m fine.
RASMUSSEN
Gerda! Where have you been?
GERDA
Away. Why, what’s wrong?
RASMUSSEN
I sold the Lili portraits!
I have enough interest to mount a full
show.
GERDA
Well that’s wonderful...
RASMUSSEN
And there’s more - I had a call from the
Etienne Dufour Gallery - they would like to
represent you in Paris.
GERDA
In Paris...?
RASMUSSEN
You should go and see them.
GERDA
Oh - I can’t travel just now...
RASMUSSEN
Gerda, this is your moment. You’ve waited
long enough... And these dealers can be
fickle.
EINAR
What are you doing?
GERDA
I’ve been asked to exhibit in Paris...
EINAR
That’s wonderful...
GERDA
Yes. We have to go. Rasmussen said it
would make all the difference...
EINAR
I’m not sure I can do that...
GERDA
You can. I’ll take care of you...
EINAR
But surely there’s no rush...
GERDA
Can’t you just do this one thing for me?
EINAR
Gerda, what’s happening?
GERDA
I had a letter from Hexler...
EINAR
He wants to lock me up.
GERDA
But he won’t. Everything will work out for
us. Really - I know it. You just have to
trust me...
EINAR
I do...
GERDA
So. Is there anything to take care of
before we go? Anyone you need to tell?
EINAR
No.
GERDA
Einar’s a painter too...
MAN
Oh? Do you exhibit in Paris?
EINAR
I think my work is a little...
introspective for French taste.
WOMAN
Excuse me - is the model here?
GERDA
No, she stayed behind in Denmark.
WOMAN
Oh, I was so hoping to meet her.
EINAR
Gerda... please... I can’t.
No...
GERDA
Will you sit for me? Just as you
are. We haven’t done that since
art school. You enjoyed it then...
The teacher suddenly at the mercy of the
student. You found it exciting.
EINAR
I... I can’t just now. I’m sorry.
GERDA
I miss you. I miss you working beside me.
EINAR
I can’t remember the landscape any more. I
can’t remember Vejle.
GERDA
Well you could help me with this
background. What does it need...?
An kettlehole lake? A farmhouse, far off? 
EINAR
Gerda...
HANS
Hey, he’s playing with us! He knows the
price...
Look, I have to go. I have some Danish girl
waiting to see me. But tell him we’ll find
another buyer, no problem. He’s always the
same!
HANS
Hans Axgil..
GERDA
Thank you so much for...
HANS
Don’t thank me yet - I can’t represent you.
I don’t handle any contemp...
GERDA
Of course, no, I know that...
HANS
The reviews for your show were terrific,
but your work is way out of my...
GERDA
Perhaps if you let me speak, things would
be clearer...?
HANS
Let you speak?
I’m a much better listener when I’m eating.
Well, I don’t know why Rasmussen
gave you my number, but I’m happy
he did...
GERDA
I asked him, I wanted to meet you,
put a face to a name...
I believe you were a childhood
friend of my husband.
HANS
You have a husband?
A bottle of the Mersault...
GERDA
I’m married to Einar Wegener.
HANS
To Einar?
GERDA
You remember him?
HANS
Of course I remember him. My God - we were
such friends. How is he?
GERDA
He told me that you kissed him once.
HANS
I what...??
Oh no! You’re right... We were fooling
in the kitchen. Einar was wearing his
grandmother’s apron...
We were just little boys, you know,
playing around? Anyway, Einar just
looked so pretty in that apron - I
kissed him! Next thing I know, his
father’s chasing me out.
God - Einar. Hey - why didn’t he come
today?
GERDA
He doesn’t know I’m here. I don’t think
he’d like me asking for help.
We don’t really know people here. And
Einar’s... he’s lost his way. He’s not
working. He needs someone to represent
him - someone who knows, him. He needs a
friend.
GERDA
Einar...?
I’ve a new dealer coming over later. I’d
like you to meet him.
EINAR
I don’t want a new dealer. It doesn’t make
sense for me. I’m hardly working anyway.
GERDA
That might change.
EINAR
I don’t think so. I’m happy helping you.
No dealer. Thank you.
GERDA
It’s Hans Axgil.
Dinner at La Dauphine at eight, then back
here to see the paintings.
GERDA
You know, Einar’s still stricken
with guilt about crashing your
kite.
HANS
It was handmade, and I've had it
since I was four! I’m glad you
reminded me. I’ll tease him about
that.
GERDA
No - it’s too cruel.
HANS
If he ever gets here. Perhaps he
doesn’t want to see me?
GERDA
No - no, it’s not that. We should order
without him.
HANS
Does he abandon you often?
GERDA
Of course not!
HANS
I was joking.
HANS
I can come back another time, if you think
Einar would prefer it...
GERDA
Really. He’s expecting you... and it will
do him good...
Einar...?
HANS
I know this... the fjord at
Vejle... not far from our houses!
GERDA
Yes, Einar painted it just before we
left...
Lili...
Hans, may I introduce Lili Wegener -
Einar’s cousin from home.
LILI
You can’t imagine how happy I am.
He holds on to her hand, instinctively kind...
We met before in Vejle, but you probably
don’t remember...
GERDA
Can I take your coat Hans?
HANS
Of course...
LILI
A digestif, Hans? It’s so chilly all of a
sudden. I feel the cold these days. I
don’t know why...
HANS
Thank you.
LILI
I’m so sorry Einar couldn’t be here. He
told me: in Vejle you were his great
friend. Both always plotting to getting
away!
HANS
That’s true...
LILI
Such a tedious place! He said you’d sit
and look out together, beyond the fjord..
to the sea... to the future.
HANS
Oh, we had big dreams...
LILI
And you were the only one who let him paint
in peace, who told him it was alright to be
a painter.
HANS
He... used to sketch my portrait. Take a
stone and draw me on the rocks at the side
of the road.
GERDA
I didn’t know that.
LILI
Oh yes.
GERDA
Would you like to see more of Einar’s
work...?
LILI
Do we have any?
GERDA
Yes, of course, Lili...
LILI
Oh, but couldn’t we see it another time? I
so want to hear more from Hans... Hans,
are you married?
HANS
No...
LILI
Why not?
He doesn’t mind, do you...?
HANS
I’ve... been on my own a long time now.
I’m too set in my ways.
LILI
I think marriage is the single thing we
should all hope for in life.
HANS
Really?
LILI
It creates someone else, more than just the
two of you. It would be terrible never to
know that...
GERDA
Lili...
LILI
Excuse me.
GERDA
You... you ought to go...
HANS
No - let me help...
GERDA
Please - please - I’m sorry...
HANS
Goodnight Lili...
LILI
Goodnight...
I don’t think he noticed anything, do you?
GERDA
I don’t know...
LILI
No, I think I got out just in time.
GERDA
Sleep now. We’ll talk more tomorrow.
LILI
Can I borrow a nightdress?
GERDA
No... we’ve never done that. Lili’s never
spent the night...
LILI
It doesn’t matter what I wear. When I
dream, they’re Lili’s dreams...
GERDA
A new dress...
LILI
And this. Do you like it?
GERDA
Yes. It’s perfect for you...
We’re actually a little short of money at
the moment.
LILI
I know, but now I’m back, I can sit
for you again, can’t I...? That
worked well before, Gerda, didn’t
it...?
HANS
It’s a good crowd.
GERDA
She’s a popular girl. Thank you for
coming.
HANS
Thank you for asking me. I thought you’d
forgotten all about me.
GERDA
We’ve been busy.
HANS
Is Einar here?
GERDA
Einar hates this kind of thing.
HANS
That’s a shame. For you, I mean.
GERDA
I don’t mind.
HANS
Is he well...?
GERDA
He’s excited. We have an old friend coming
to town: Ulla Fonsmarck, the dancer. Do
you know her?
HANS
I don’t think so. Could I take you to
dinner? To celebrate? Someone ought to.
GERDA
No. Thank you.
HANS
Gerda, have I offended you?
GERDA
No.
HANS
Gerda...
GERDA
I am still Einar’s wife.
MAN
Hans!
MAN
At least take an umbrella...
GERDA
I’m fine, honestly...
MAN
If you just wait a minute someone will
drive you...
LILI
Gerda...? Oh - you’re wet through.
Did it go well...? Tell me - how
was it?
GERDA
You’d know if you’d been there.
LILI
I’ve made us a supper...
GERDA
You should have come.
LILI
A little sort of celebration...
GERDA
This is not how it goes! We do
these things together!
LILI
That’s you and Einar.
GERDA
Stop playing that stupid, stupid
game!
LILI
Don’t you say this is a game!
GERDA
You should have been there!
LILI
How could I be? Look at me!
GERDA
Not everything’s about you!
I need to see Einar.
LILI
Let me help...
GERDA
I need my husband. Just get him!
LILI
I can’t...
GERDA
I want to talk to my husband. I want to
hold my husband. I need him. Can you get
him? Can you at least try?
HANS
Gerda... what is it?
You’re soaked...
Gerda... wait...
GERDA
I can’t...
HANS
Wait...
Will you be alright?
GERDA
I’m always alright.
HANS
For God’s sake. Take some kindness where
you can.
GERDA
Einar always comes back in the end. He
always has...
HANS
Maybe this time... he just can’t.
GERDA
I’m sorry.
I’ve never not finished a painting, I don’t
know how to give up.
EINAR
I don’t think I can give you what you
want...
I don’t know how long we can go on like
this.
GERDA
No.
ULLA
He needs to see someone.
GERDA
You know what happened with Hexler.
ULLA
But he’s so thin, Gerda...? There’s
something wrong with him.
GERDA
Lili watches her figure...
ULLA
Look, there’s a doctor - he runs the
Women’s Clinic in Dresden.
He’s interested in men like Einar. Men who
are... different. Who are... confused.
He’s often in Paris.
Just talk to him? It couldn’t hurt, could
it?
GERDA
Oh good... you’re awake... how do
you feel?
Come.
EINAR
I can’t - I have somewhere to go...
He pulls on a jacket.
GERDA
Where?
I’m sorry - I don’t know how to hold on to
you any longer.
EINAR
I know. But I love you and I’m
going to find an answer.
MAN
Lesbian...
You speak English? Are you a boy...
MAN
Or a girl...?
HANS
But I’m worried that will be too late. I
can’t hold the buyers much longer...
Einar...
EINAR
You’re good at this.
HANS
I boxed for a while.
EINAR
Shame you weren’t with me earlier.
Sorry I’ve never been to see you before.
HANS
That’s alright. You’re here now.
EINAR
I couldn’t let Gerda see me this way. She
has enough to put up with.
HANS
Let me know if you feel light-headed.
EINAR
I’m permanently light-headed.
HANS
God, Einar, what’s happened to you? I
don’t understand...
EINAR
Ha - nor do I. But I don’t think it’s
anything new... Even in Vejle...
HANS
What?
EINAR
Well I was different.
HANS
It didn’t take much to be different in
Vejle! Surely, that’s why we became
friends?
EINAR
I wanted to thank you for looking after
Gerda.
HANS
It’s no great hardship.
EINAR
I’ve let her down.
HANS
She doesn’t think that.
EINAR
Every morning I promise myself I’ll spend
the whole day as Einar. But there’s so
little Einar left.
HANS
You need building up...
EINAR
No. I think Lili’s thoughts. All the time.
Even here, now, I’m having to work so hard
just to... to be me. To be this.
HANS
You think these things because you’re
exhausted...
EINAR
I think sometimes about killing Einar.
It’s only the thought that I’d be killing
Lili too that stops me.
HANS
You need to see someone. A doctor.
EINAR
No doctors.
HANS
Yes, Einar. You have to try.
BUSON
A confused state of identity.
I drill small holes - here, here and
here...
MCBRIDE
I’ve listened carefully and I’m afraid it’s
not good news.
You’re a homosexual.
EINAR
Well, I don’t really know what kind of help
I need, but I can’t go on living without
knowing who I am.
DR MAI
Mm... very good...
Please excuse me a moment...
EINAR
Do you think I’m insane?
GERDA
Did a doctor say that?
EINAR
I’m sorry, I know we agreed no more... but
look at me.
GERDA
You’re not insane.
Did I do this to you?
EINAR
What...?
GERDA
Sometimes I think if it hadn’t been for the
paintings...
EINAR
Oh no... no, no. You helped bring Lili to
life, but she was always... she was
waiting...
GERDA
But now she’s making you ill.
EINAR
I don’t know what to do. The doctors can’t
help me.
GERDA
Do you want to try one more...?
WARNEKROS
So what do you think would explain what
you’ve been experiencing Mr Wegener?
EINAR
Professor Warnekros... the fact is... I
believe I am a woman inside.
GERDA
And I believe it too.
EINAR
You probably think I’m insane. That we
both are...
WARNEKROS
Well, there are people who think that I’m
insane. But I think you’re probably right.
I’ve met another man like you.
I pursued his case - against the
wishes of my colleagues, of course.
I told him I could operate. To make
him fully a woman.
EINAR
Is that really possible?
GERDA
What happened to the man? Was the
operation successful?
WARNEKROS
It never took place. On the morning of the
first operation, he ran away. He was too
frightened.
EINAR
I wouldn’t do that.
WARNEKROS
Perhaps he was the smart one. The surgery
has never been attempted before.
GERDA 
Professor Warnekros, what is this 
surgery...? 
WARNEKROS 
Two operations... The first to 
remove the male parts entirely. 
The second - once you were strong 
again - to construct a vagina. 
An irreversible change, and a high 
risk of failure, of infection, 
complications. 
GERDA 
It’s too dangerous... 
EINAR
Gerda and Einar exchange a look. Warnekros observes.
WARNEKROS
I leave for Dresden at lunchtime tomorrow.
Mrs Wegener, I do believe I can 
help your husband. But he won’t be
your husband when I’ve finished. 
EINAR
I feel strange going dressed like this.
GERDA
It’s important. Hans says the Germans will
check your papers.
HANS
Don’t take any chances. You’re nearly
there.
EINAR
I won’t be seeing you again.
HANS
You know, I’ve only really liked a handful
of people in my life and you’ve been two of
them.
Take care. Take care. 
GERDA
I wish you’d let me come with you.
EINAR
I can’t. You love Einar. And I have to let
him go.
GERDA
Here, take this...
HANS
Gerda...? Let me give you a lift.
GERDA
I’m going to walk.
GUARD
Next stop, Dresden. Dresden is the
next stop...
RECEPTIONIST
Hello...?
LILI
Yes, my name is Lili, I’m here to see
Professor Warnekros. 
RECEPTIONIST
Lili what?
LILI
Oh... Lili Elbe. Yes. Like the river.
RECEPTIONIST
Please take a seat...
LILI
Must I really wait?
WARNEKROS
It’s only a week, We need you to rest and
gain some weight. We can’t risk an
infection.
For what I’m attempting, you’ll need to be 
strong.
LILI 
This is not my body, Professor. 
Please take it away. 
URSULA
Do you think Spring will come early?
I saw you looking at the crocuses.
LILI
Oh - yes. You’re having a baby.
URSULA
And you?
LILI
No - I’m ill inside. But Professor 
Warnekros’s going to make me better. He’s
operating tomorrow.
URSULA
Will you be able to have children after?
The question catches Lili by surprise, sets her thinking...
LILI
I don’t know.
URSULA
I hope so.
NURSE
To help you sleep tonight.
HANS
Rasmussen called. The Dufour people want
you in their group show. I like the idea.
GERDA
I’m sorry?
HANS
The Dufour Gallery?
Gerda, why don’t you go...?
GERDA
He asked me not to.
HANS
He wanted to protect you. You
should be there. I’ll go with you.
GERDA
No. If I go, it’ll be alone.
HANS
Now you’re sounding like Einar.
GERDA
I am like Einar.
HANS
What do you want me to do Gerda?
GERDA
I want you to go away.
HANS
Really?
GERDA
No, I’m sorry...
WARNEKROS
She only regained consciousness very 
briefly. We’re having to give her a great
deal of morphine, of course, so that’s to
be expected.
It’s nothing, I assure you... 
NURSE
You mustn’t move Lili. It only makes it
worse...
GERDA
My God...
NURSE
Excuse me...
GERDA
I’ll do that. I’m here now. Don’t worry,
I’m here...
LILI
I can feel I’m getting better when I listen
to your pencil.
You’ve always sketched me better than I
was.
GERDA
Have I...?
LILI
What you draw, I become. You made me more
beautiful, now you’re making me strong.
Such power in you.
Shall we go back to Denmark then, Gerda?
Shall we go home?
GERDA
Lili! Lili, you’re late...
So, these...
LILI
Every two hours. And I have to eat
something first. I have a few
macaroons in my bag all ready.
GERDA
And these, only if you need them.
Good luck.
MANAGERESS
And remember, making a purchase at
Fonnesbech’s is not merely
shopping. It’s an experience! You
lived in Paris, yes?
LILI
Oh yes...
MANAGERESS
Let everyone know! The store is a
stage - we are here to perform.
LILI
And in Paris, a lady would never
dream of spraying the scent
directly onto herself.
No, you spray the air, see, and
walk into it...
Voila..!
You try...
GIRL
It’s so unfair - you’ve got the
sweetest tooth and the narrowest
hips in the whole store...
GIRL
How do you manage it, eating so
much sugar?
LILI
Oh, the trick is to eat nothing
else...
GIRL
See you tomorrow!
GIRL
Lili - are you coming...
GERDA
You know one night last week, I had
the strangest dream.
LILI
What...?
GERDA
I dreamed you were getting married.
LILI
Do you think I ever will...?
GERDA
Who knows? So many strange things
have happened. 
It’s not so long ago we were
married... you and me.
LILI
You and Einar.
GERDA
I know it was Einar. But really it
was you and me.
HENRIK 
Is it really you...? 
LILI 
I believe so. 
HENRIK 
So what you’re suggesting is.. 
That a doctor... 
...intervened... 
LILI 
To correct a mistake in nature. I 
have a passport to prove it. 
HENRIK 
He made you a woman...? 
LILI 
God made me a woman. The doctor 
cured the sickness that was my 
disguise. 
HENRIK 
A real woman? 
GERDA
You’re going to need a new notebook
if you carry on like this.
LILI
When Professor Warnekros suggested 
I keep a diary... well, I thought
I’d never have anything to write.
But it helps, to make sense of
things.
GERDA
Perhaps I should try it.
Do you never think of painting?
You might be good at it.
LILI
I want to be a woman, not a
painter.
GERDA
Well, people have been known to do
both. I’d be curious to see what
you painted, that’s all. Sometimes
it’s hard to know what’s in your...
Didn’t you just take one of those a
minute ago?
LILI
Gerda, I know what I’m doing.
I’m going to get some fresh air.
You know sometimes I wonder why you
let me go through all this if you
thought everything would be the
same afterwards.
GERDA
I didn’t. But I promised Einar I’d
take care of you.
LILI
For goodness’ sake, Gerda - Einar
is dead. We both have to accept
that. You took care of me, now I
have to take care of myself. I
have to have a life of my own. And
you need to do the same.
RECEPTIONIST
Yes, in London... Is it urgent?
Should I could ask him to..?
GERDA
Oh, no that’s fine. Just tell
him... just say...
It’s a beautiful day in Copenhagen.
LILI
It’s not what you think. Henrik is 
homosexual. There’s nothing between
us. But I should have told you I’d 
seen him.
GERDA
No you shouldn’t... 
LILI
He’s just a friend, Gerda. Someone
to talk to.
GERDA 
Because you can’t talk to me. 
LILI
About some things, no. 
Gerda lifts her glass, proposing a muted toast, but Lili has 
something more on her mind... 
I’ve made a decision. I’m going 
back to Dresden. For the second
operation.
GERDA
It’s too soon.
LILI
No, it’s time. I need to finish
what I started.
GERDA
You’re not strong enough...
LILI
Professor Warnekros thinks I am... 
GERDA
Warnekros...? He hasn’t seen you.
LILI
I’ve made up my mind.
GERDA
It could kill you.
LILI
I’m going on Friday. Will you come
with me?
GERDA
I won’t help you to hurt yourself.
LILI
Gerda, will you come...?
WARNEKROS 
This will be harder than the last 
operation? You understand that. 
LILI 
Yes I do. 
WARNEKROS 
It’s complex surgery. 
LILI 
And I’ll sleep all the way through 
it! 
WARNEKROS 
Yes you will, but... 
LILI 
You’ll be there when I wake up. 
I want a husband who looks just 
like you! 
And maybe a child. Like a real 
woman. 
WARNEKROS 
One step at a time. 
Get some rest, now. Goodnight.
LILI
You’re still angry with me.
GERDA
I’m not angry with you, I’m worried
about you.
LILI
You heard my wish Gerda. When no
one else could hear me, you did.
GERDA
Come. We both need our rest. I
can sleep in the chair, there...
LILI
Off to your little hotel.
GERDA
I don’t mind...
LILI
Are there chocolates on the pillow?
GERDA
Cigarette burns.
LILI
Take this... There’s a chill in the
air.
GERDA
You keep it. For now.
LILI
I’m going to be fine.
GERDA
Yes.
LILI
Sleep well.
GERDA
Goodnight.
GERDA
Room 9.
Hans...?
HANS
It’s alright.
GERDA
Yes.
HANS
Everything will be alright.
WARNEKROS
Good luck, everybody.
RECEPTIONIST
Professor Warnekros would like a 
word...
WARNEKROS
She lost a lot of blood. Now we’re
struggling to keep the fever down.
There’s a chance it will burn
itself out, but...
I’m sorry... I have to be honest.
The prognosis is not...
GERDA
Go away... thank you. Leave us 
alone.
GERDA
Lili...?
I’m here... just lie still... It’s
alright...
HANS
Oh, Lili. How are you?
LILI
I am... entirely myself.
HANS
I’ll tell Warnekros she’s awake.
GERDA
You know you had us worried...
LILI
Can I go outside, Gerda? Into the
garden?
GERDA
I think you should rest...
LILI
Please...
You mustn’t worry about me any
more, Gerda.
GERDA
It’s an old habit. I’m slow to
change.
LILI
How have I ever deserved such love?
I’m sorry you were frightened.
There’s nothing to be afraid of any
more.
GERDA
No.
LILI
You know, last night, I had the
most beautiful dream... I dreamed I
was a baby in my mother’s arms...
and she looked down at me... and
called me Lili...
GERDA
Lili...
Lili...
Lili...?
GERDA
No - leave it..! Leave it..
Let it fly...
