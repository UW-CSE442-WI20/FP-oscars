AILEEN 
I always wanted to be in the movies.
When I was little I thought for sure that
 one day I was gonna be a big, big star.
I used to imagine there was a camera
following me around that could see what
nobody else could. And I just knew, one
day I'd be famous.
Or at least rich. Rich and beautiful like
the glamorous women on the television.
I'd have a good looking husband and great
big family and a house on the beach.
I had a lot of different dreams. About
what I'd be like. How I'd live. Who I'd
be.
As I got older I learned to stop sharing
this with people but still wheriever I Â·was
down I would just escape into my mind 
 to my other life, where I was someone
else.
All these people just didn't know yet who
I was gonna be. But one day they would.
I started wearing  makeup real young and
was always super concerned with my
image 
I was always secretly looking for who it
was gonna be would discover me. Was it
this guy?
Or maybe this one? You never knew.
But even if they couldn't take me all the
way, somehow somebody would believe in me
just enough.
They would think I was beautiful. Like a
diamond in the rough. They would take me
away to that new life. That new world.
Where everything would be different.
I iived that way for a long, long time ..
In my head, dreaming like that .. It was
nice.
But one day  it just stopped.
By the time I met Selby Wall?  shit,
all I wanted was a beer,
GIRL
Hey.
SELBY
Hey!?
GIRL
Someone sitting here?
SELBY
No.
LEE
Hey man! You got a towel or something?
BARTENDER
Ma'am our services are for patrons only.
LEE
Yeah, I'm gonna buy a fucking beer
alright?!
LEE 
Wow  thanks a lot. Gimme a Miller 
please!?
Hey! What's this like a gay place?
BARTENDER
Uh yeah.
LEE
Hey  whatever, man.
SELBY
Hey
LEE
Hey  dude!
SELBY
Hi!!  Can I buy you that drink?
LEE
I've got money.
SELBY
Oh  uh, can I have a pitcher? Whatever
she's having.
SELBY 
So, do you come in here a lot?
LEE
No  Hey, you don't have a kleenex or
anything do ya?
SELBY
Oh. sure.
LEE
Hey, you got a fucking problem?!
LEE 
'l'hanks. Do I have mascara runnin?
SELBY
No  You look beautiful.
LEE
Hey, I'm not gay alright!?
SELBY
No? Well, that figures. If you were you
probably wouldn't even be talking to me.
None of these girls will  So what are
you doing in here?
LEE
Truck broke down. I'm a  I got a
pressure cleaning business
SELBY
What's pressure cleaning?
LEE
You know, steam cleaning? Carpets,
upholstery, so. I'm just getting out of
the rain.
SELBY
Oh  my name's Selby.
LEE
Lee 
Fuck  I'm out of here.
SELBY
Are you sure? It's still raining
LEE
Look you fat fucking dyke! Don't waste
yer time, I'm not gonna fuck you for a
beer
SELBY
Hey, you know what? I wasn't trying to
fuck you  for your information  I know
you won't fuck me. I just wanted to talk
to you and I thought maybe if I bought
you some beer you'd talk to me. So get
over yourselfl
I was just trying to have one decent
night out, at least talking to someone,
before I head right back into my parents
closet anyway. So I don't see how sitting
here with the best looking girl in the
place is a waste of time if I'm the
lesbian.
Sorry I bothered  I wasn't trying to
insult you 
SELBY 
You  you don't have to stay.
LEE
Hey, it's no skin off my nose  I was
just trying to be straight with you.
SELBY

LEE
No, I'm not!

LEE
No, it's a real good job, actuaily  Pressure cleaning.

SELBY
Can I  can I touch yer face?
LEE
Yeah, I guess.
SELBY
Yer so  yer so pretty.
AILEEN
I've always moved too fast in love, but
I'd spent most of the day sitting in the
rain about to kill myself, so you can
understand I wasn't feeling particularly
cautious.
Hookers had been showing up dead all over
the Florida highways and when I found
myself secretly hoping the guy would just
get me and finally end it all, I knew I
had nothing more to lose.
Everybody's got faith in something. For
me, all I'd had left was love  But when
my boyfriend took off and stole all of my
pressure cleaning equipment, something
finally broke.
I 'know that part had sounded like a lie
but I'd spent two years saving up for
that stuff so when he left, I was pretty
sure I'd never love a man again.
And without love, without even hope of
it, what's the point. Even a bum on the
streets is looking for something,
alcohol, drugs, something.
The only reason I didn't do it was a five
dollar bill. I kept feeling it in my
pocket and it was bugging me.
I knew I'd probably given some asshole a
blow job for it, so it really started to
piss me off that if I killed myself
without spending it, then I would have
basically sucked him off for free.
WOMAN 
Honey?
AILEEN 
So I made a deal. I said "God, you've
done this to me and I don't know why.
Now, I'm going into town to spend thi~
five bucks but when it's gone  so am
I.,,
"So if you've got something for me in
this world you had better bring it on."
And sure enough there she was.
SELBY
Honey  Aren't you corning to bed?
LEE
In a minute.
WOMAN 
Selby honey?
SELBY
Sorry, uh  just a sec. Debbie?
DEBBIE

SELBY 
Oh, you're so mean.
LEE
Hey I'm here too.
SELBY
So  can I ask you a question?
LEE

SELBY

LEE

SELBY
I don't know. I just  people like, pay

LEE
Yeah? This is gonna cost you fifty.
I'm just kidding you. No  I like you.
SELBY
So, like  what do you  do_ to them?
LEE
All kinds of things  Whatever they
like.
SELBY
How do you know what they  ?
LEE
Shit, well they're not shy about telling
ya, but truth is they're easy to read.
SELBY
So what's that guy like?
LEE
Finger up his ass  Probably likes to be
humiliated at the same time.
SELBY
Oh geez, that's ewwww  What about him?
LEE
Oh, he's gay.
SELBY
No way!
LEE
Definitely. Tries too hard; either gay or
he's got a small dick, but I'd bet twenty
on gay.
LEE
That one, straight S&M. Tie you up. Whips
and chains.
SELBY
That's my cousin!
LEE
Ohhhhh no. Sorry  'Anyway. It's, you
know, not the best job.
SELBY
I'll bet, they line up to be with a girl
like you.
Lee shrugs, almost proud.
LEE
I guess  I don't know. Not really.
What's Ohio like?
SELBY
I don't know  I mean, I had a bad time
before but  I'm trying to be
optimistic.
Well, since I'm  gay  or bi.
LEE
Bi?
SELBY
Well, yeah, I could probably like a guy,
who knows?
But before I left this girl from my
church told my parents I tried to kiss
her so they kind of disowned me. It was
bad. Thought I could figure myself out
down here, but then I broke my arm before
I could find a job, so, now, cause my dad
had to pay the bills, I made him a deal
to come back  But we talked, which is
good, so  maybe it'll be different.
LEE
Why, they gonna let you hang out with
hookers now?
SELBY
Oh  well  no, but. I don't know.
Maybe I can  try to change. Save my
soul and all that.
LEE
I think yer soul seems pretty good.
SELBY
Thanks. Hey, Who knows though. Maybe one
day I'll come back down  we can hang
out?
LEE
Forget about next time. This time I'm
gonna beat your ass around that floor.
SELBY
Oh no  I don't 
LEE
C'mon . I got cha.
SELBY
How'd you get so good?
LEE
Aw, I used to go all the time.
LEE
Oh man, I love this song.
SELBY
Me too! I love this song too! But I can't
do that.
LEE
Yes you can.
You navigate. Make sure we don't hit
anyone.
SELBY
Why?
LEE
Cause.
SELBY
What?
LEE
Here just look at me. Sense 'em.
LEE 
You wanna get outta here?
SELBY
Yeah  but where? I don't think we can
go back to my aunts.
LEE
Yours are so small 
SELBY
Yeah? No one's ever  really held 'em
before.
LEE
Maybe soon some big guy, huh?
SELBY
Uh  well  I doubt they'd like me even
if I did like them.
LEE
Do you like me?
SELBY
Yeah I like you! 
SELBY 
Do you really like me?
LEE
Yeah.
SELBY
I thought you didn't like girls.
LEE
I don't  really like anyone  But I
like you?!
SELBY
Figures. Only girl who ever liked me
shows up now  here.
LEE
Hey. Well we've got tomorrow right? Lets
just do it up!
SELBY
Alright.

SELBY
Really? Oh  I don't think I can afford
it.
LEE

your money on me.
LEE
Nah, after you pay me for this tonight,
I'll just use that money.

SELBY
I wish I could.
LEE
So do ?
SELBY
No. I can't. I promised him.
LEE
So? He's your fucking dad!? Can't he

But hey. Look, here it is. So that's no
issue girl. We could rent a hotel. Hang
out. Party. Whatever.
SELBY
Where'd you it?
LEE
I'm good like that I told you. It's no
big thing.
SELBY
So why don't I go up there and try to
figure it out 
LEE
No. I can't wait. I won't be here.
Just  listen, once in a lifetime
opportunity here.
LEE 
If you wanna go later then fine! I'll
drive you to the fucking bus and buy you
a ticket. Whatever you want  But
otherwise. Nothin. You'll never see me

like me again.
SELBY
Please Selby  it's stupid not to.
LEE
I'm serious.
SELBY
Geez  I  okay.
LEE
Alright! Okay Okay, let's go.
SELBY
Wait, no, what about my stuff?
LEE
Fuck your stuff. I'll buy you new stuff.
SELBY
No, hang on  not 
LEE
Get your shit in a week  seriously.
It's yer fucking aunt, she's not gonna
throw it out.
SELBY
Oh lord  Hey where'd you get this car?
LEE
Borrowed it.
SELBY
Who's this for?
LEE
For me  If I'm going dyke, right?
SELBY
What do we do?
LEE
Whatever you want 
AILEEN 
To tell you the truth, at first I wasn't
bull shitting. All I wanted was a week.
Between the fact that Selby was heading
back to some miserable life, and I'd
probably get caught for what happened
sooner or later anyway 
I figured the least he could do was
finance the two of us a little joy.
We had a little money and a little time,
and that was all that I wanted.
Just the sides and the back, alright?
Smooth. 
And man, it delivered. Suddenly I felt
like I was a part of something. A couple.
Like those people I'd always watched from
afar.
Hey this here's my girlfriend 
SELBY
Hi
LEE
Look out for her if you see'r around!
Hey  set us up man. JD with backs.
And no matter how tired I was, or how
much I could worry, I was alive. And for
the first time in years I really felt it.
So I thought I'd just take what I could
get as long as I could.
But the funny thing about the good things
in life is, once you get a taste, they
never are enough.
SELBY
I'm just here to get my stuff. I'm sorry
about everything, okay. So.
DEBBIE
Oh no you don't. Selby, your
father has been calling
here
SELBY
No Debbie. No. I'm not
talking to him
DEBBIE
night and day. You need to have some
respect!
DEBBIE 
Hello? John?  Um hmmm. Well, she's here
now, hold on.
SELBY.
Hello
FATHER
What in the good lord's name were you
thinking?
SELBY
Hey, look  I met a roommate, so I
figured I'll stay with her til I can save
up some money.
FATHER
How dare you, you filthy liar! You think
I can't read between the lines with your
dirty little lesbian visitors?
SELBY
Dad
FATHER
You must think I'm a damned fool. Now!
stop humiliating this family! And you
will get on a bus
SELBY
No  I'm not coming back.
FATHER
Oh, yes you will!? You wanna live like a
street person? You think you won't be
crawling back here in two second
SELBY
No, I won't! She's not a street person.
For your information she makes tons of
money  more than you  I'm an adult
Dad, so  just, that's what I'm doing.
And I'll send you your money back
FATHER
I do not want filthy money
SELBY
Fine. Then, bye.
DEBBIE
Selby, what are you doing?Â·
LEE
I quit.
SELBY
You quit what?
LEE
What's yer suitcase doing here?
SELBY
I'm staying.
LEE
What?
Oh honey  Oh man, you just made my
day  How'd you get yer bag?
SELBY
I took a cab.
LEE
All the way there?
SELBY
Listen  You can take care of me for a
bit right? Cause  man 
LEE
Honey, I will take care of you. I will.
In fact 
I'm cleanin up for ya. Quitting hooking.
No, more. I've got you to think of and
I'm gonna do this right.
SELBY
Why?
LEE
Lot of reasons. Cause I should  and I
hate it. Hate it!
SELBY
But I thought it wasn't that bad?
LEE
Well it is.  It's not. Not always but
now  I don't know. Why not, I'm not
stupid, I coulda been whatever I wanted,
but no, everybody "yer this and yer
that." Fuck 'em. I got you. I got
everything going for me. And you know?
We're a couple. That's not fair to you
for me to be out there.
SELBY
Oh, well I don't really mind. I'm not
jealous if that's what you mean. It seems
like good money so?
LEE
So, I'll get a job. Go straight. Career.
I'll get a career. How 'bout that?
SELBY
Alright.
AILEEN 
I once heard this saying that's always
stuck with me. I must have been around 13
years old, cause I remember I'd just put
the baby up for adoption.
They had called an assembly at my Jr.
High School cause this guy who played
drums for Slim Whitman was coming to talk
to us about success and making your mark
on the world.
I was really excited cause he
was the first real celebrity
I'd seen and this was just
exactly the kind of thing I
wanted to learn how to follow
in the footsteps of
Now  I don't have any
experience per se but I'm a
real hard worker and I learn
fast 
so I listened really hard to any
advice he had and sure enough he said
something that just stuck right in my
mind. It was  "all you need in life is
love and to believe in yourself, and then
there's nothing you can ' t do." 
LAWYER
Okay? So basically you have no
experience, no resume, no work history 
no college degree, but now you'd like to
be  what, a laywer?
LEE
No. Your ad says you're looking for a
secretary.
LAWYER
Okay. Then you need to know how to type,
you need computer skills, most of our
secretaries have degrees, many even
specialize in the law, do you see what
I'm saying here? I'm sorry I'm not trying
to be harsh, but frankly it's a little
insulting. Okay? I see Daytona Beach, it
looks like a great time. I'm sure it's
fun but when the party's over you don't
suddenly up and get what pe6ple have
worked their entire lives for. Okay?
LEE
Fuck you man  you don't know me!
LAWYER
Okay, great. That's great. See now I wish
I'd hired you.
Leslie can you please escort Ms. I don't
even know what her name is because of
course she doesn't have a resume, out.
LEE
I don't need a fucking escort
motherfucker.
All you need is love and to believe in
yourself. Nice idea. It doesn't exactly
work out that way but I guess it was
better to hear a flat out lie, than know
the truth at 13.
so I flung all his shit around, told
him to fuck himself and kiss my sweet ass
and pheewww  out the door.
SELBY
What did he do?
LEE
Nothing. Not one thing. I'll bet nobody's
talked to him like that in his life. Man,
it was great  Office jobs! shit, who
even wants a job like that? fuckin' sit
at a desk, blah, blah, blah, eat ass all
the time.
SELBY
I thought you did?
LEE
Well I did, but you know what? It's no
different. See before, hooking I thought
I was just seeing this one side of men
but it's all the same. Whether you're
working with 'em or they're fucking you.
It's all about fucking you, one way or
the other  and lying  And see that's
some bad shit cause actually you know
what? I've been thinking about this  our
real problem here goes way further than
just one on one, you know what I'm
saying?
SELBY
No.
LEE
I'm seriously concerned on a larger level
about the state of our world!? And why;
same shit.:. You got politics, business  war and it's all the same as the
cocksuckers braggin and fighting on the
street. Either way it's cause men got a
small dick or some power complex?! Like
in the bible, the two sexes, god makes
one the right way: women but with the
men here we've got a fatal flaw.
Procreation: fucking  and on the other
side here you've got technology. Xou see
what I'm saying?
SELBY
Lee, what? Fine. But we're broke.
LEE
Cubby  two more here.
I know that! I know that?! You think I
don't have shit lined up?
CUBBY
Honey, I can't run you a tab like this.
LEE
Cubby god damn it, how long have I been a
customer? Cut me some slack here.
SELBY
Lee, look, why don't you just  you
know, just for a day or so
LEE
I don't have to fucking hook Selby?!
That's not what I'm saying.
SELBY
I'm not saying it either. But Lee, you
said  Man, I'm sitting in that room all

JUSTINE
She bought these an hour ago and wants to
exchange them.
MANAGER

He hands her a few coins. Lee forces a smile, but clenches
her teeth with hatred as soon as she turns.
COP
Ma'am .. I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you to come with me.
LEE
Why?
COP
We've had some complaints.
LEE
What'd they complain? Cause I just got

WILL

LEE
Yeah of course.
WILL
You like to fuck?
LEE
Sure, but let's get this out of the way
here. Money first  Let's see it.
WILL
Jesus, you'd think nobody'd ever talked
dirty to you before.
LEE
Yeah  No, I just like to settle.
WILL
You wanna call me daddy while I fuck you?
LEE

WILL

you can't get enough
LEE
You're a child molester. Child molester.
Fucking child molester. 
LEE
Ha!
What is that man? See?
Lee tosses the wallet into the car and stares at him. Her
emotions are all over the place but she b~eathes herself into
a calm and begins to undress.
LEE
Hey  so you need some money?
SELBY
Yeah?
LEE
Oh, alright 
SELBY
Holy 
LEE
No problem?
SELBY
It was okay?
LEE
Yeah. It was fine. Look. I'm unna wash
up.
Lee goes into the bathroom.
SELBY
There's hundreds of dollars here?!
LEE
I know  I told you. I'm good.
SELBY
Oh my god
SELBY 
Lee?
LEE
Hang on, baby. I gotta wash up here.
SELBY
Oh. Hey  where'd you get the car?
LEE
Remember 'I'hornas? I was out on 95 so I
called him to pick me up? He let me
borrow it so we can move 
SELBY
We're moving?
LEE
Yeah, fuck this place, right?
SELBY
Oh man. Can we get a big place with a
kitchen?
LEE
Whatever you want baby. Whatever you
want.
Life is so strange. It's hard, but it's
also funny how things can be so different
than you might think.
The first time I realized that I remember
thinkin' it was sad. Every year the 4H
club would set up a big carnival in my
neighborhood and right smack in the
middle of it 
 was this beautiful, gigantic Ferris
Wheel that lit up in the night sky. As a
kid, I thought it was about the coolest
thing I'd ever seen. They called it THE
MONSTER.
All summer I'd sit in my bedroom window
and watch Â·it turn, just dreaming of what
it would feel like to ride on.
It's all yours.
I thought for sure it would feel like
flying. So when I was old enough, after
years of thinking about it I finally got
my chance.
I'll tell you, I waited in line all day
and I've never been so excited since, but
sure enough 
I was so nauseous and scared I threw up
all over myself before it even made a
full turn.
And that's what I mean. In my life it's
always been the harmless stuff that hurt
the most..
 and the thing so horrible you can't
even . imagine it is usually a lot easier
than you think.
You never really know until you're the
one standing there.
SELBY
This one's too heavy 
Hey, how much are those? You got all the
names?
Do you have a lot of the S's?
MAN
Ma'am, I think it'll be easier if you
just tell me your name?
LEE
Take yer fucking hands off her!
LEE 
Why you need to know her name? Huh? 
She didn't do nothing!?
LEE 
Fuck him asking your name, right?
LEE 
Fuck this place! 
 Fine, you buy whatever you want.
Cause there's plenty more where that came
from 
SELBY
I'm sorry. she's. she's 
SELBY
Lee  he was just asking cause
LEE
I don't care why!? Why you fucking chit
chatting with everyone all the time.
SELBY
Chit chat?  You never let me talk to
anyone!
LEE
Yeah, ca~se you got a big mouth 
Sell, hey, you're not used to this life,
I know, but  you can't be telling
anyone our business.
SELBY
Why, cause you're a hooker? So what,
Lee?! There not gonna bust you for
hooking at Mervy
LEE
No, because I said so.
I'm sorry  I'm just trying to protect
you.
I'm going out. Here  Why don't you
order yerself a nice pizza or something.
I love you  love ya honey. Hey, I hate
fighten'  How bout I buy ya some shoes
tomorrow?
SELBY
Awright 
LEE
So where you like to fuck, in the back?
Yeah? I'll bet you get rough back there?
Huh? You like it rough?
Yeah  quiet type, huh? I know the type.
You're the kind who can get real nasty 
Why don't you say it, though. Tell me 
GENE

LEE

SELBY

Hey, 'member me?
JUSTINE

SELBY
Yeah. Listen, I came to pay you back.
I  I never do stuff like that.
I was just out of my mind hungry. I'd
broke my arm, see, and couldn't work.
JUSTINE
I don't think it was that much.
SELBY
Whatever. You were real nice about it.
LEE
Hey! Where were you?
SELBY

LEE
There's a mouse down there.
SELBY
Did you get it?
LEE
No. It's just a little mouse. Look at em.
SELBY
Ew. . . Kill it.
LEE
No, he's just a poor little mouse. He's
so scared  Did you get any cheese?
SELBY
Ughh  No. But I did get  a job.
LEE
What? Why?
SELBY
Because  we need the money.
LEE
But I just gave you money.

Well, see now it's gone  Besides, I

SELBY

SELBY 
No, not leave. Just on a regular basis.
So boom I'm like, no way

threw his stuff around and stormed out.
They all laugh.
Yeah, who wants an office job anyway

JUSTINE
What'd he do?
SELBY
Nothing  Not one thing.
JUSTINE

SELBY
Yeah that's nice. I miss my family.
JUSTINE
Don't you? Me too. And my friends _  my
church. Everything about home really. Â·
Oh  did Chris show you the trigger?
SELBY
Well _that's pretty cool.
JUSTINE
Yeah  the trigger's great. Works on
most of these old ones.
JUSTINE 
Okay  one last time?
SELBY
Hey  She was just showing me the
machine.
This is Lee  my girlfriend ..
LEE

SELBY
What are you doing here?
LEE

JUSTINE
Oh, Denny's gone but I'm the manager

LEE

LEE 
Hmmm. So you don't mind if I borrowed

SELBY

SELBY

LEE
I don't need your money! Besides, she
doesn't mind.
SELBY

LEE

SELBY
Why you gonna ruin my job?
LEE

You do! You treat me just like everyone!
Just like everyone! And I love you!
SELBY
And I love you too. Jesus  nothing's

SELBY 
What's the big deal? I can't even take a
photo with my boss? She's my boss?!
LEE
I borrowed a car to go to six flags.
SELBY
Great. We'll go to Six Flags  Jesus 
Why you gott~ be like that, Lee!? You
embarrass me.
LEE
Just go straight.
SELBY
You're sure?
LEE
Yeah look  Or don't look. Watch the
fucking road!
LEE 
So I think we should move. Don't you
think?
SELBY
Why?
LEE
Cause. We could get a house on the beach.
SELBY
That's like  thousands and thousands of
dollars, Lee.
LEE
So  I got it covered.
LEE 
I can. Cause you know what? I've been
thinking about it and yer right we don'tÂ·
have enough money! And shit, I don't want
you slavin' away at some job. So I got a
plan. And it's taken care of! 95%! We're
movin' to the Keys. Drink, party, have
friends over. I'll even be nice. Why?
Cause I got a job!
SELBY
Are you serious?
LEE
Dead serious. Dead serious, man~ Whatta
you think?
SELBY
I dunno. You're not kidding me?
LEE
I'm not. Like I said. 95% to that
junction, then phheww. You and me! 
LEE 
I'm  sorry, for how things've been 
I just love ya. And I'm trying real hard.
But it's not easy. Nobodies ever stuck
with me this long  Or loved me, really.
I'm not good at it.
LEE 
But I'm gettin' better!  So we moving?
SELBY
Well  we can really get a house? How

LEE
Real close Sell  Just a few rnore
Suddenly they fly forward with a
LEE
Get up!
LEE 
Run.
SELBY
What?
LEE
Run Sell!
LEE 
Aww shoot. Your dad's gonna kill us.
WIFE
Are ya'll okay?
LEE
Oh, we're fine.
You fine? Awww yeah, we're fine.
WIFE
I'm 'onna call an ambulance.
LEE
No! No!
LEE 
Shoot. We don't have insurance. I'd just
rather deal with this myself, you know?
WIFE
Sure?
LEE
Her dad's place is just around the block.
LEE 
Get the.fuck in Sell. Go.
LEE 
Yeah. See, cost of towing and all. If I
can drive her it'll save us a bundle.
Come on wotherfucker.
Hey  thanks though!
Let's go.
Come on Sell! Now!
SELBY
I don't wanna I wanna drive.
LEE
No. We can't.
God damn it, come on.
Selby! He's dead, man! He's fucking dead.
We gotta get outta here right now.
SELBY
So?  Say it!
Say it!
LEE
What do you think?
SELBY
Oh god~ What've you done!? It's all over,
isn't it? They're coming!
LEE
Nobody's coming  Yer overreacting.
SELBY
Whadda you mean? You're .killing people.
LEE
Hey!
SELBY
You can't go out killing
LEE
God damn it, Selby. Keep your fucking
voice down! Now listen to me  They
aren't coming!
LEE 
I never wanted you in this shit Sell.
But I know what I'm doing alright?
There's no fucking way for you to
understand it all so you gotta trust me.
She pulls out a stack of articles and puts them pn the bed.
Se~by t akes in the plentiful stack with a moan.
Look, they don't have one god damn thing.
This shit here is long over already so
they're not even looking and they didn't
seem to give a shit in the first place 
These guys were bad news! You see what
I'm saying? Nobody cares!? You got these
rapists and killers, with ten different
pe9ple want 'em dead so they shut the
book. I'm doing 'em a favor! Now, beyond
that I'm still real carefulÂ·
I didn't exactly wanna wreck the fucking
car in public!
But we did  and I figure if they were
gonna call the cops  they woulda done
it then, so nobody's coming after you.
SELBY
How could you?!
LEE
Selby, come on  You knew.
SELBY
No I didn't. I knew about one.
LEE
No  But it's the same thing.
LEE 
Alright, fuck it 
Come on in here Sell!'
C'mon. We got some Patsy, some drinks,
it's all good in here. Alright? Come on.
SELBY
What are you doing?
LEE
Having a drink. Cheers.
SELBY
This isn't funny, Lee!
LEE
Cause you don't know what's going on.
And I do! And I understand you wanna shut
yer eyes to the world. Man, but the least
you can do is hear me out  cause you're
dead wrong!
Okay  Now, none of this is what you
think it is.
SELBY
I know what it is
LEE
No, you don't know my life!? But I know
yours. Man 
I've done everything in this whole wide
world, hoping you would never know. I
love the way you s1=e it!? I'm jeal_ous! I
wish so bad I could be like ya, and just
not know. But I can't, Sell. And as much
as I hoped to keep it from ya, so you
could go on thinking people are good and
kind and shit makes sense. Honey there's a whole lot more going on. And
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for you. Cause now
you got to know.
SELBY
No,. Lee 
LEE
Yes Sell! Yes! You need to.
SELBY
No. We can be different as we want but I
know that you can't murder people.
LEE
Says who?
Selby, I'm good with the lord! I'm fine.
And I know how you were raised and how
everybody thinks and  fuck it has to be
that way. They gotta tell you that 'thou
shalt not kill' shit and all that jazz.
And, of course, you can't do it fer
nothin'?! But that's not the way the
world works, man. Nobody knows what the
fuck god wants?! Who wrote the bible?
Some fucking people. The fuck did they
know really? There wouldn't be killing if
it hadn't been created, right? And people
kill each other  every day. And fer
what? For politics? For religion? And
they're heroes!? No. Now  I didn't ask
for this but I'd be dead right now. What
am I supposed to do with that?
If I hadn't killed somebody I'd be dead!?
Would you've wanted that?
SELBY
No. But that was one guy, Lee  How
many?
LEE
A lot  I'm cleaning up!
SELBY
They can't all've been bad.
LEE
They can't have been bad? Read the paper!
I'm not the only one out there killin' 
but I'm the only one killin' them.
They're just killing us wholesale. So
don't feel bad, Selby! I haven't hurt one
person who didn't flat out deserve it:
I've had it up to here with youÂ·can't! 
While the world decides what I will take,
or die. There's a lot of shit I can't put
up with anymore. Killing's not one of
'em. Letting these guys go out and rape
somebody else, isn't either
So open your mind and look at me! You
know me. You think I could do it
otherwise? I'm not a bad person.
I'm a good person! A real good person!
Now  I'm sorry baby, for all that
stuff. For you to know  but look
Look Sell  you see what this is? This
right here is everything, everything
you've ever wanted?! See? I told you I'd
take care of you! And look 
This here, is almost enough to buy
another pressure cleaning unit, man! I
know you want more, I know you want the
good life, so here it is?! Self employed,
put all this behind us  You think I'd
let the world stop me from that??
No, you're my girl!? I'd get you anything
you ever asked for 
SELBY
No  Lee, that doesn't make it right?
LEE
What?! No, it is right! It is right! I
just told you!
SELBY
No, but you're wrong. The world is a good
place 
and there are nice people out there, yes
there are!
LEE
No, baby  there's only you  and me.
SELBY
There were lots of other way
LEE
There is no other way. This is it
SELBY
But I got a job
LEE
Making what? You wanna live like that
SELBY
I don't know. I can't  think!?
LEE
There's no where to go, Sell! I'm yer
home. You need me! You need me
SELBY
Let me go! I'm not yer prisoner! I
gotta  I gotta! Don't follow me!
LEE
I'm not keeping you. Go if you want. But
you'll come, back okay? And I'll be here.
I'll be here  I'm not mad! I love you.
SELBY
Can I  can I talk to you?
JUSTINE
Not  right now. Can you wait outside?
What are you  doing here?
SELBY
Hey, I, oh, I just needed to talk to
someone.
JUSTINE
Well, I'm working?!
SELBY
No, I know, I'm sorry  I'm just freakin
out and I needed  a friend.
JUSTINE
Yeah, I hardly know you though.
SELBY
No, yeah! Yeah, I know but since  I
felt a connection with you.
 and, I don't know? Things are real bad
with my girlfriend. I'm  we might be
breaking up.
JUSTINE
I'm not gay, alright? That was just
playing around  I thought you were nice.
SELBY
Oh  no, right I know but I meant
friends. Like friends 
JUSTINE
Umm hminrn. Well, I mean, I don't know â¢
what the problem is but I can't  Look,
I'm a Christian and the manager, and I
don't know if you misunderstood with the
candy bars but I can't be involved with
whatever it is y6u're  "into" here. I
can't  I don't think you should work
here. I'm sorry.
SELBY
No no, I'm not  I'll pay you back.
JUSTINE
I don't want you to pay me back. Just
please, don't come here.
SELBY
But I've got nowhere to go 
Justine throws her hands up as if shielding an oncoming
attack from a savvy con artist, or stalker.
JUSTINE
Oh my gosh, I don't even know you  just
please, leave me alone!
LEE
Hi baby
SELBY
So how longs this gonna take?
LEE
No, time baby. We're almost there.
SELBY
Good. I wanna go now.
LEE
Okay, tomorrow. Tomorrow, I'll get a car.
SELBY 
I don't know if it's right, or it's
wrong, but  I don't care anymore.
I'm gay. And our life is great. She loves
me, I love her, it all worked out.
So I just wanted you to pass that along
to my dad and tell everyone we're doing
fantastic, and not to worry 
DEBBIE
mmmhrnmm Well. I know it's not what
they want to hear 
SELBY
What!? That I'm happy?
DEBBIE
No  that yer choosing to go this way.
SELBY
I'm not choosin'. This is just how I am
and I don't feel bad about it anymore 
Tell him that too.
DEBBIE
Selby  your father loves you. I don't
know what gave you the impression that he
doesn't want you happy. That's precisely
what we worry about.
SELBY
Well, then there's no problem.
DEBBIE
Not now but  I know your all romantic
about this girl. You probably think she's
wild and interesting. I was young once
too but 
Screwed up people are who they are for a
reason. And they're better left alone.
Â·Now, I'm not talking about being born a
nigger or
SELBY
Don't say nigger, Debbie!
DEBBIE
What, I was saying it's not their fault?!
The blacks or whatever you want to say.
Selby, you know I'm not racist!
But  my point is, most of these other
people have made some bad choices, and
they pay for em? All these miserable
street people. So we just worry to see
you choosing this life for yourself too.
The gay life. 
SELBY
No, it's not that simple! And you don't
know her? She's had a real bad life.
DEBBIE
Honey, lots of people have bad lives and
choose to move towards the light.
Otherwise we'd all be hookers and
druggies 'cause we got yelled at or had a
mean mom.' You know?
SELBY
No. It's not that simple  look, I don't
wanna hear this okay? That's the point!
DEBBIE
Okay, fine  but, believe me, as you get
older all you'll want is a roof over your
head, even if you have to sleep with a
man to get it.
SELBY
Well that's not what I want.
DEBBIE
Okay, fair enough. Just know that we love
you and still want you back 
SELBY
Well, that's not gonna happen, because I
disagree. We're good with the lord cause
we're real good people!
EVAN
Are we going on a hike? Where you Â·headed?
LEE
This is fine.
EVAN
The car was fine.
LEE
Not when you have a gun in it!?
EVAN
So? Lots of people have guns 
you going to undress or what?
LEE
You first. You think I trust you now?
LEE 
You're married  I don't get that. You
like to do dirty things to girls instead
of just fucking your wife. Why, so you
can rape 'em?
EVAN
No! Good lord.
LEE
Man, men  I fuckin hate em. I mean
there's a few good ones but not guys like
you. . . fucking "johns."
EVAN
Well  then why are you a hooker?
LEE
I'm not.
LEE 
I don't fuck men! I did at one time.
I mean I did a lot actually. Most of the
time against my will you know? Shit, I've
been fucking men since I was 8 years
old?!
EVAN
Oh, good God.
LEE
Yeah, man. This old man raped me when I
was 8. My dad's friend. Not one person
believed me. So he kept raping me  for
years. And my dad beat me up for it.
LEE 
Where you going?
EVAN
I'm not  I'm sorry for you. But if you
want a ride you'd better come on.
LEE
I don't need a ride. I'm takin' your car.
What, you piece of shit you think I'm
stupid enough to go back to your car with
you, motherfucker! Huh?
EVAN
Tttake it. Here.
Please.
LEE
Don't say fucking please to me! You think
you'd have mercy if the shoe was on the
other foot motherfucker?
LEE 
Huh? You don't have nothing to say do
you, motherfucker!  say somethin!
EVAN
No 
LEE
Victor Borne  That was his name  my
dad's friend. Some friend. Rape your
daughter. But my dad was loyal to him.
I'll give 'em that much. So much for
justice. One night, after years had gone
by, I knew I was gonna have to kill him.
I had a plan and a knife. I knew he was
corning to dinner so I went to his house
and hid outside in the bushes. I was so
ready and so filled with hate, but when
he finally stepped out he looked so big
and I felt so small and ridiculous that I
lost my nerve.
I couldn't do it. Just watched him walk
away. Went home and ate dinner with him.
Mom yelled at me for being rude when he
asked me for the salt.
Years later, when I found out he had died
in a car accident, I was overjoyed. It
was like God finally struck him down for
all his evil. I loved it.
Knowing you can't get away with your shit
forever. Sooner or later it'll catch up
with you.
Mother fucker!
Sellllll 
SELBY

NEWS CASTER
which we reported a few
weeks ago. Earlier today the
Broward County Police
announced that they believe
the hunt is on for a seriaL
killer. Six homicides
involving male victims found
off of local florida
highways, are now believed to
be related.
They have asked that people use
extreme caution when traveling alone and
strongly advised against picking up any
hitchhikers at this time. Anyone with any
information about these crimes is urged
to come forward in an effort to save more
lives.
SELBY
C' mon Lee  c'mon

information about the suspect but in a
warning issued earlier they alerted
travelers that the perpetrator could
possibly be a hitchhiker or prostitute.
