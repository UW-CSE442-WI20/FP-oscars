KIWOO
NO. Not you too “iptime.”
Ki-Jung! Upstairs neighbor
finally locked up his Wi-Fi.
KIJUNG
Try ‘123456789.’ Then try it
backwards.
KIWOO
No luck.
CHUNGSOOK
What am I supposed to do if
someone calls me? What if it’s a
job? Hey, Ki-Tek!
I know you’re awake, asshole.
Care to comment?
KITEK
What? 
CHUNGSOOK
Our phones have been suspended for
weeks, and now the neighbors have
shut us out. What’s your plan?
She kicks him again.
What are you going to do about it?
What’s the plan, genius?
KITEK
Son, if one seeks Wi-Fi
He raises his hand high.
KITEK 
One must reach into the heavens.
Up.
KIWOO
Yes, Father.
KIWOO 
BOOYAH!
KIJUNG 
You got it?
KIWOO
You see it? “coffeenara_2G”. I
guess it’s a new coffee joint.
Must be nearby.
KIJUNG
I’m not getting shit.
KIWOO
Get up closer.
CHUNGSOOK
No text from Pizza Time? 2,000
more boxes and it’s payday.
KIJUNG
Close the window.
KITEK
Leave it. Free fumigation. Get
rid of the damn crickets.
CHUNGSOOK
Shit!
KIJUNG
I told you to close it!
CHUNGSOOK
Fuck me.
KIWOO
Watch. If we all fold like this
girl, we might even get paid
today.
OWNER
Look at this for example. This
shitty folding job here.
OWNER 
One out of four. One-fourth of
the boxes are unusable.
CHUNGSOOK
Still, you can’t cut ten percent
from my pay. That’s too much.
OWNER
I should pay even less considering
the number of botched boxes.
CHUNGSOOK
We were barely making anything to
begin with.
OWNER
Look. It’s not that simple. Each
ruined box exponentially tarnishes
our brand’s image.
CHUNGSOOK
Your “brand”? You only have two
stores in Seoul. Fuck this
OWNER
What did you say?
KIWOO
It’s that kid, isn’t it?
OWNER
What are you talking about?
KIWOO
The part-timer at your shop. He
went MIA, didn’t he? During such
a crucial time too. You have a
large group order from The Love of
Christ Church. That’s why you and
your husband are out here working
your bottoms off.
OWNER
How do you know that? Who told
you?
KIWOO
That kid, he’s my friend.
KIJUNG
Totally unreliable. Not-sostellar reputation.
KIWOO
I understand you’re upset. Ten
percent? Fine, we accept. That’s
completely within your authority.
However
OWNER
However what?
KIWOO
Would you consider hiring a new
employee?
KIJUNG
Fire the loser who bailed on you.
KIWOO
I can come in for an interview
tomorrow. What would be a good
time for you?
OWNER
Wait. Hold on. I need to think
about this
KITEK
What a special occasion. The four
of us gathered here to celebrate
the partial reactivation of our
phones as well as our son’s
upcoming job interview with a
national franchise.
KIWOO
Cheers!
KITEK
To family!
That son of a bitch. It’s not
even dark yet!
CHUNGSOOK
How many times did I tell you? We
need to put up a “No Urinating”
sign.
KITEK
It’ll make them want to do it even
more. It’s psychology.
KIJUNG
Go yell at him or something!
KIWOO
It’s not the right timing
The Drunk Man hasn’t unzipped his pants, still hovering
uncertainly in the dark corner.
KIWOO 
I need to catch him in the act.
CHUNGSOOK
Isn’t it fucking obvious? Just
kick him out!
KIJUNG
I hate this place.
MINHYUK 
HEY, MISTER!
KIJUNG
Is that Min-Hyuk?
CHUNGSOOK
It is.
MINHYUK
What do you think you’re doing?
You think this is a public toilet?
MAN
I, uh
MINHYUK
What are you looking at!
KITEK
Your friend has mucho cajones.
CHUNGSOOK
It’s that college student glow.
Look at that confidence.
KIJUNG
Which Ki-Woo obviously doesn’t
have.
MINHYUK
How are you, Mr. and Mrs. Kim!
KITEK
Min-Hyuk! Good to see you, son!
KIWOO
What’s with the surprise
appearance?
MINHYUK
I texted you.
Hey, Ki-Jung.
KIWOO
We could have met somewhere else.
You didn’t have to come all this
way.
MINHYUK
I brought this.
MINHYUK 
It’s heavy so I had to bring it on
my bike.
KIJUNG
What’s this?
MINHYUK
When I told my grandfather I was
going to see Ki-Woo, he gave me
this.
KITEK
Whoa.
Ki-Tek picks up the large stone.
KITEK 
This is a precious viewing stone.
Is this an abstract specimen?
MINHYUK
You know your stones, Mr. Kim.
Pop-Pop’s been collecting viewing
stones since his academy days.
Our house is literally filled with
these things  living room,
study, basement... This one is
supposed to bring luck. And
money.
KIWOO
How perfect for us. Symbolic.
KITEK
Yes, how serendipitous. Please
send him our sincere regards.
CHUNGSOOK
He should’ve brought food.
MINHYUK
I had to bring that stupid rock,
but it was nice to see your folks.
They look good.
KIWOO
They’re not as good as they look.
They’re all jobless.
MINHYUK
Ki-Jung’s at home too? She
doesn’t take college prep classes?
KIWOO
It’s not that she doesn’t want to.
She can’t.
MINHYUK
Cute, right?
KIWOO
Is that her? The girl you’re
tutoring?
MINHYUK
Park Da-Hae. A sophomore. I want
you to tutor her. Take over for
me as her English teacher.
KIWOO
That makes no sense.
MINHYUK
Her family’s loaded. The gig pays
really well.
MINHYUK 
She’s a good kid. I want you to
look after her until I come back
from the study-abroad program.
KIWOO
You have plenty of friends at
school. Why do you want a highschool grad to teach your prized
student?
MINHYUK
Why do you think? I shudder just
thinking about those femalestarved engineering students
drooling around her like hungry
wolves. It’s revolting.
KIWOO
You like her, don’t you?
MINHYUK
I’m serious about her. I’m going
to ask her out in two years, once
she’s in college. I want you to
take care of her while I’m gone.
I trust you.
KIWOO
I appreciate the trust, but you
want me to pretend I’m a college
student?
MINHYUK
Ki-Woo, think about it. How many
times have you taken the college
entrance exam? Twice before your
military service and twice after
 a grand total of four times.
Grammar, vocabulary, composition,
speaking. You’re an English
master. Far more qualified as a
tutor than I am. Better than
those spoiled college brats who
drown their brain cells in booze
everyday.
KIWOO
That may be true but You think
the family would accept me? I’m
not even a college student.
MINHYUK
We’ll embellish a little. You’ll
be fine. You’ll have my
recommendation. And the mother is
a bit
MINHYUK 
She’s simple. Young. And simple.
KIWOO
Simple? What do you mean?
MINHYUK
I don’t know. Just simple.
MINHYUK 
I hear Ki-Jung is handy with
Photoshop.
KIWOO
This is amazing. How come you
keep failing the art school exam?
KIJUNG
Shut up, dickwad.
KIWOO
Take your time.
We should hold off on the printing
until the place clears out.
KITEK
Look at this. There should be a
major for document forgery at
Seoul National University. KiJung would be top of the class.
CHUNGSOOK
Shut up and wish the boy good luck
for his interview.
KITEK
My son
KITEK 
I’m so proud of you.
KIWOO
I don’t consider this a crime.
No. Because I plan on going to
this school next year.
KITEK
That’s my son. Man with a plan.
KIWOO
I’m just using some of their
administrative services in
advance.
FEMALE
Who is it?
KIWOO
Mrs. Park? Hi, I’m Min-Hyuk’s
friend
FEMALE
Oh, hello. Please come in.
MUNKWANG 
Quite a view, isn’t it?
KIWOO
Mrs. Park, pleasure to meet you.
MUNKWANG
Oh, no. I’m the housekeeper.
Please follow me.
KIWOO
Stunning garden.
MUNKWANG
The inside is even more stunning.
MUNKWANG
Do you know Namgoong Hyunja? The
famous Korean-French architect?
MUNKWANG 
This used to be his house. He
built it.
KIWOO
I see.
MUNKWANG
Now it’s just Da-Hae’s house.
Please wait here. I’ll get Mrs.
Park.
The tutor is here.
YONKYO
What do you think of him?
MUNKWANG
I don’t know, but he’s handsome.
YONKYO
I don’t care about papers. I only
wanted to see you because you were
recommended by Min-Hyuk. I guess
you two are good friends.
I’m sure you know better than I
do, but Min-Hyuk is just the most
brilliant human being. I don’t
even care about the grades. DaHae and I absolutely adored him.
Do you know what I mean?
KIWOO
Of course.
YONKYO
We just loved him so much. I
wanted him to stay with Da-Hae
through her college exams next
year, but now he’s leaving to
study abroad and I’m suddenly left
without a tutor. I mean, what am
I supposed to do?
Excuse my bluntness, but I just
don’t see the point of hiring
someone unless he’s as utterly
outstanding as Min-Hyuk, you know?
I guess what I wanted to ask was
 Would it be okay if I sat in
for today’s class? I want to see
the whole thing. Judge for
myself. I would like to see your
 methods.
KIWOO
Uh...
YONKYO
Is that okay with you?
KIWOO
Are you sure about question 14?
DAHAE
Is it wrong?
KIWOO
I’m asking you. What does your
gut say? Do you think number 14
is right?
KIWOO 
You were working on other
questions before you came back to
DAHAE
Yes.
KIWOO
If this was a real test and number
14 was the first question, you
would’ve been in trouble from the
start.
KIWOO 
See? You pulse is irregular.
Your heart doesn’t lie.
What are you supposed to do in a
test? You move forward. You need
to seize the flow. The rhythm.
If not, you’re screwed. I don’t
care about question number 14. I
only care about how you seize the
flow. How you conquer the test as
a whole. You get it?
A test is all about confidence.
Attitude.
I know. You were angry.
Frustrated. You worked so hard.
Studied until your nose bled. But
your test scores weren’t
improving. You keep asking
yourself, ‘What am I doing wrong?’
I’m here to prepare you for the
real thing. I’m not here to help
you learn. I’m here to help you
score.
YONKYO
I’ll pay you each month on this
day. As for the lesson, I was
thinking three times a week?
Monday, Wednesday, Friday?
KIWOO
That sounds good.
YONKYO
It’s a little more than what MinHyuk used to get. Cost of living
and so forth.
KIWOO
Thank you.
As Ki-Woo puts away the envelope, Mun-Kwang brings over a fruit
plate. She’s noticeably friendlier than before.
YONKYO
I guess it’s time to get to know
each other. Mr. Kevin will be DaHae’s English teacher.
MUNKWANG
Of course! Mr. Kevin, you let me
know if you need anything at all
during your lessons  snacks,
drinks, whatever.
KIWOO
I appreciate it.
YONKYO
Feel free to pester her if you
need anything in this house.
She’s the expert. She knows it
better than I do.
YONKYO 
Da-Song! Behave yourself. We
have a guest!
MUNKWANG
Armpit attack!
DASONG
No!! It stinks!
YONKYO
I apologize. Our son is a little
unique.
KIWOO
Unique is good.
YONKYO
He has trouble focusing. ADHD.
We signed him up for the Cub
Scouts hoping the discipline would
help, but he’s become an even
bigger weirdo. Now he’s obsessed
with Indians
KIWOO
The Scouts have roots in American
Indian culture, so he has the
right idea.
YONKYO
You were a Scout too?
KIWOO
Yes, I learned a lot as a Scout.
YONKYO
Look how fine you turned out.
What’s wrong with him?
He’s actually an art prodigy, you
know. Did you see the drawings?
Those are his.
KIWOO
A lot of symbolism. Such strong
point of view.
YONKYO
Right? Strong. I knew you would
get it, Mr. Kevin.
KIWOO
I see. It’s an interpretation of
a chimpanzee.
YONKYO
It’s a self-portrait.
KIWOO
Of course. Us grown-ups are too
jaded to see true genius.
YONKYO
That must be why. We’ve gone
through dozens of art teachers.
They never last more than a month.
Of course Da-Song is a bit much to
handle.
KIWOO
Actually... Mrs. Park.
YONKYO
Yes?
KIWOO
Someone just happened to come to
my mind. Her name is
Girl’s Generation. The girl
group. What was her name  the
one who started the jewelry brand?
YONKYO
Jessica?
KIWOO
Right! Jessica. My cousin has a
school friend named Jessica. I
don’t know her Korean name. She
studied applied arts at Illinois
State and recently moved back to
Korea.
YONKYO
Ah, Illinois State. What about
her?
KIWOO
She also tutors, and she’s known
to have a very unique approach to
teaching art. Most of all, she
knows how to handle kids.
YONKYO
Is that so?
KIWOO
She’s a bit of a celebrity in
tutoring circles. Her style is a
little unorthodox, but it still
gets kids into good art schools.
YONKYO
She sounds fantastic. I’m so
curious.
KIWOO
Would you be interested in meeting
her? She’s very busy so I’m not
sure if I’ll be able to get an
appointment
KIJUNG
Jessica?
Why Jessica. So tacky.
KIWOO
It has a nice ring. Anyhow.
She’s a nice lady. Young. Not
the brightest tool in the shed.
The money is good, and most of
all, she’s a ‘believer.’
CHUNGSOOK
She’s religious?
KIWOO
No, it’s just She tends to
trust people rather easily.
KITEK
She sounds like a great lady.
KIWOO
Right?
CHUNGSOOK
Yeah.
KIJUNG
Jessica, only child, Chicago
Illinois / My classmate Jin-Mo is
cousin of Kevin
KIWOO
I should go upstairs for my
lesson. I’ll let you two talk.
Jessica, nice meeting you.
KIWOO 
I’ll see you next time.
KIJUNG
Thank you, Kevin.
KIWOO
Where did we leave off? Number
17?
DAHAE
You know
KIWOO
What is it?
DAHAE
You know it’s all an act, right?
My brother.
KIWOO
What are you talking about?
DAHAE
It’s all fake. Acting all
bizarro. Like he’s a crazed
artist. He’s a big fraud.
KIWOO
Da-Song?
DAHAE
You know, like he would stop in
the middle of the street and
pretend he was struck by a sudden
inspiration.
KIWOO
Randomly stare up at the clouds
and ponder the shapes? Something
like that?
DAHAE
Exactly! He’s the worst! And he
acts like he can’t behave normal.
Like he’s completely perplexed.
Makes me want to puke.
KIWOO
So Da-Song is a fraud. What does
that have to do with your English
problems?
DAHAE
I’m just saying.
KIWOO
Good. Now those were all great
descriptions of Da-Song. Why
don’t we use them to compose a
paragraph in English? You must
use the word ‘pretend’ at least
twice.
DAHAE
Can I ask you something?
KIWOO
What now?
DAHAE
The teacher downstairs. Ms.
Jessica. Is she really your
cousin’s friend?
KIWOO
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
DAHAE
She’s your girlfriend, isn’t she?
KIWOO
Come on. I just met her today.
DAHAE
She’s very pretty. Not even
interested?
KIWOO
She is pretty. A beauty even.
DAHAE
I knew it. You are interested.
KIWOO
If you were a perfect ten, maybe
she would be a six? Six-pointfive?
KIWOO 
Let’s study.
DAHAE
Right.
YONKYO
I should tell you. He’s not good
at staying in one place.
I hope you understand
KIJUNG
It’s fine.
DASONG’S ROOM
KIJUNG 
Would you mind leaving?
YONKYO
Excuse me?
KIJUNG
I don’t allow parents to sit in
during lessons.
YONKYO
I just thought, since it’s the
first day As you can see, the
boy is a bit
KIJUNG
You should wait downstairs.
MUNKWANG
Would you like some plum extract?
I can add some honey. It’ll help
you relax.
YONKYO
What? Oh. Sure.
YONKYO 
I have an idea! This is what
we’ll do!
MUNKWANG
What?
YONKYO
You’ll take two plum juices to DaSong’s room. You’re not a parent
so you can go in. You’ll just be
delivering the drinks.
MUNKWANG
You’re right. I’ll take a quick
peek and let you know how they’re
doing.
YONKYO
Dammit. Why didn’t I think of
this before?
You guys are... done?
KIJUNG
Mrs. Park, will you please have a
seat?
YONKYO
Sure.
KIJUNG
Da-Song, you go up.
Da-Song drew this today.
I’d like to speak to you alone.
YONKYO
Oh, this is
KIJUNG
Can you please give us a moment?
I mentioned earlier that I’m also
studying art therapy.
YONKYO
Yes, I remember
KIJUNG
Did something happen to Da-Song
when he was in first grade?
I feel a bit cautious about
bringing this up  it’s the first
day after all  but I’ll need to
know what happened to Da-Song in
order to truly understand him.
YONKYO
When he was in first grade
I’m sorry. I don’t know if I can
talk about this right now.
KIJUNG
It’s fine. We can talk about it
later.
KIJUNG 
Here. This lower section is
what’s called the ‘schizophrenia
zone’ in psychology. It contains
clues about the mental state of
the child. Do you see this
particular shape drawn here?
YONKYO
Yes. Yes, I do.
YONKYO 
My gosh! It’s in the other
drawing too! Same spot!
KIJUNG
Yes. Same spot, same pattern.
YONKYO
I see that picture everyday.
Every time I eat.
I had no idea.
KIJUNG
You don’t have to beat yourself
up. These drawings are records of
Da-Song’s emotions. A black box
of his soul. I’d like to try and
unlock that box. But I’ll need
time.
YONKYO
Of course. Please take as much
time as you need. I can wait.
KIJUNG
I suggest four two-hour sessions a
week  Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday. This is different from
regular tutoring  it’s art
therapy  so I would need to be
compensated at a higher rate.
YONKYO
Of course. I understand.
Oh
Dong-Ik. Say hi to Ms. Jessica,
Da-Song’s new art teacher. She
just started today.
Jessica, this is Dong-Ik.
KIJUNG
Hello.
DONGIK
Thank you for helping Da-Song.
Are they done for the day?
YONKYO
Yes, they just finished.
DONGIK
Sorry Yun, but are you busy
tonight? Would you mind taking
Ms. Jessica home? I don’t want
her walking down the hill alone at
night.
YUN
Where do you live, Ms. Jessica? I
might as well just drive you
home
KIJUNG
It’s fine. Just drop me off at
Hyehwa Station. Thank you.
YUN
Doesn’t matter if it’s far. I’m
done for the day
KIJUNG
I’ll get off at Hyehwa.
YUN
It looks like it’s about to rain.
I bet the Mercedes is way better
than the subway
KIJUNG
No. I’m supposed to meet my
boyfriend at the station.
YUN
I see.
KIJUNG
Did you drive Benzes when you were
a designated driver?
KITEK
Not when I was at the designated
driver service. I drove a lot of
them when I was a valet.
KIJUNG
When were you a valet?
CHUNGSOOK
After the fried chicken and before
the Taiwanese Castella. About six
months, I’d say?
KITEK
Nah. It was after the Castella
shop went bust.
KIWOO
We’re already starting Phase
Three?
KIJUNG
I planted a little trap in the
Mercedes. We’ll see if he bites.
KIWOO
Then it’s begun.
Father, how amazing is this? We
just so happen to be eating at a
buffet for drivers. How symbolic!
KITEK
This place IS amazing! You guys
eat as much as you want!
CHUNGSOOK
You’re not even buying, you big
bum. They are.
KITEK
Here.
KITEK 
Have some of this, Son.
KIWOO
Thanks, Dad!
By the way, what did you say to
Mrs. Park yesterday?
KIJUNG
Why?
KIWOO
She was over the moon about you.
Saying that you were a godsend. A
freaking miracle FedExed from
heaven.
KIJUNG
I just googled ‘art therapy’ and
did a little improv, and she just
lost her shit. Started crying
like a baby. Can’t believe how
gullible she is.
YONKYO
What’s wrong? Something happen?
DONGIK
It’s Yun. That son of a bitch. I
found this under the car seat.
You pay him well, don’t you? He
doesn’t have money to go to a
hotel? Is he saving that money
for something?
YONKYO
Maybe he’s a sexual deviant? He
might get off on doing it in his
boss’ car.
YONKYO 
I’m sorry, babe. I had no idea
that he was such a perv.
DONGIK
I don’t care who or what he
screws. That’s his business. I
get it. He’s a young guy.
But why does he have to do it in
my car? And why in the backseat?
That’s my space. Is he trying to
mark his territory? With his
dirty cum stains? Son of a bitch
crossed the line.
You know what’s even weirder?
YONKYO
What?
DONGIK
Don’t you see? Think about it.
DONGIK 
So they have sex in the car. It’s
not unusual to leave behind a few
strands of hair, maybe an earring.
But how do you forget your
underwear?
YONKYO
It’s true. You don’t just forget
to put on your knickers.
DONGIK
That’s why. I’m more concerned by
his  partner. Her mental state.
Do you know what I mean?
YONKYO
Nooo
Like methamphetamine? Cocaine?
DONGIK
Shhhh!
YONKYO
What do we do? If they find some
kind of white powder in your car,
we’re all doomed!
DONGIK
Calm down, babe. Relax. We don’t
want to go too far. Not yet. For
now it’s just a suspicion. A
well-founded one.
DONGIK 
We can’t even take something like
this to the police. And it would
look ridiculous if I tried to
interrogate him. What would I
say? “Yun, did you have sexual
intercourse in my car?”
That’s why I was thinking
YONKYO
Yes, dear.
DONGIK
You have to take care of this.
Come up with some kind of bland,
harmless reason. Let him go
quietly. Don’t even mention the
panties. Or the intercourse.
YONKYO
I understand. We don’t want the
neighborhood birds gossiping about
the Parks’ driver sexing up the
boss’ car.
DONGIK
Exactly. Our names will forever
be linked with his disgusting
behavior.
YONKYO
You don’t think Yun would post
something online, do you? Go on a
Twitter vendetta? He could
announce to the whole world that
he was unfairly fired by a famous
tech CEO.
DONGIK
We’ll pay him severance. Enough
to keep him quiet. Just choose
your words carefully when you let
him go. Then we’ll be fine.
YONKYO
Are you guys done? How was DaSong today?
YONKYO
Ms. Jessica, I wanted to ask. The
other night, when Yun took you
home...
KIJUNG
Yes?
YONKYO
This may sound weird but Did
anything happen that night?
KIJUNG
No. I went straight home.
YONKYO
Good, good.
That’s good to hear.
KIJUNG
Such a nice man. I asked him to
drop me off at Hyehwa Station, but
he kept insisting that he would
take me home.
YONKYO
So the bastard went to your house?
At night? He knows where you
live?
KIJUNG
No. I just got off at Hyehwa.
YONKYO
Thank God. You did the right
thing.
Nice, Jessica.
KIJUNG
Did something happen to him?
YONKYO
He, well He won’t be working
for us anymore. There was a bit
of an incident. You don’t need to
know the details.
KIJUNG
That’s too bad. He seemed like a
nice man.
YONKYO
You’re so precious, Ms. Jessica.
So innocent. You still have a lot
to learn about this world.
YONKYO 
We used to like him too. We were
excited to have a driver who was
young and hip.
KIJUNG
I thought most people preferred
older drivers.
YONKYO
Yes, it’s true. Older drivers
tend to drive more carefully.
They’re more sophisticated.
KIJUNG
My uncle had a driver who was like
that. Mr. Kim. A real gentleman.
Such a kind man. We used to
follow him like an uncle.
YONKYO
Really?
KIJUNG
Yes. He was such a warm and
kindhearted person.
Unfortunately, my uncle was
transferred to Chicago and had to
let Mr. Kim go. I don’t know what
he’s doing these days
YONKYO
I’m very interested in this
person, Ms. Jessica. Do you think
I could meet him? As you can see,
it’s becoming harder and harder
for me to trust people. I won’t
hire anyone unless they’re
recommended by people I
absolutely, positively trust. I
just have a feeling he could be a
great candidate since you grew up
with him and all.
KIJUNG
Would you like to meet him?
Are you serious?
YONKYO
I am deadly serious.
I think this is the best way to
hire people. Through people I
trust. It’s like a, what should I
call it
YONKYO 
‘Belt of Trust.’
DONGIK
Sorry. I’ll. Be. Right. With. You.
KITEK
Don’t worry, sir.
Take. Your. Time.
DONGIK
This isn’t a test or anything so
you don’t have to be nervous. I
just wanted to get out of the
office. I was dying in there.
Ki-Tek is in the driver seat.
KITEK
I understand. You’re surrounded
by people all day. I’m sure you
want some peace in the car.
DONGIK
Thank you. You must know your way
around the city.
KITEK
Every highway, road, and alley
south of the DMZ. When you do
this for 30 years, it becomes
second nature.
DONGIK
I admire people who work in one
profession their whole lives.
KITEK
It’s a simple job really. But I
take pride in it. Every morning,
I go on a journey. With a father,
a CEO, or just a solitary man
walking through life. It’s a sort
of companionship
DONGIK
Ah.
KITEK
That’s how I’ve treated my job for
the past 30 years. How time
flies.
DONGIK
Exquisite corner-work. I can feel
your experience.
KIJUNG
She’s an old fox. She acts like
she’s Mrs. Park’s sister.
KIWOO
She’s been in the house the
longest. Longer than the family.
She used to work for the previous
owner, the architect Namgoong
Hyunja, who recommended her to the
Parks when he moved to France.
Told them she takes great care of
the house and so on
CHUNGSOOK
So she survived an ownership
change.
KIWOO
It’s a made job. Of course she
won’t just let go.
KIJUNG
If we want to extract her, we’ll
need to do some prep work.
KIWOO
That’s right. We need a plan.
CHUNGSOOK
Hey, how about some more hot sauce
here?
KIWOO
There’s something that Da-Hae told
me.
DAHAE
I’m so sick of apples. I want
peaches.
KIWOO
Then why don’t you just ask for
them?
DAHAE
We can’t have peaches. It’s a
forbidden fruit in our house.
KIWOO
The housekeeper has a severe peach
allergy. If she even goes near a
peach, she’ll turn red and start
hyperventilating. Full-on asthma
attack. Does everything but kill
her.
MUNKWANG
It was the worst one I ever had.
I was sure I was going to die.
No. I’m telling you. No peaches
for miles. That’s what I’m
saying. It’s driving me nuts!
KITEK
Mrs. Park. I, um, I didn’t know
if this was worth mentioning, but
I wanted to make sure.
He shows Yon-Kyo a photo on his phone.
KITEK 
This person behind me. Is that
YONKYO
What Hey, that’s Mun-Kwang!
KITEK
So it was her. I didn’t quite
remember her face. I’d only seen
her a couple of times when I went
up to the house.
YONKYO
Where is this from? Is that a
hospital?
KITEK
Yes. I was at the hospital the
other day for an annual check-up.
I was taking a selfie to send my
wife when I saw her behind me.
YONKYO
Looks like she’s talking on the
phone.
KITEK
Yes, see I didn’t mean to, but
I ended up overhearing
KITEK
I, uh, didn’t mean to eavesdrop,
but I happened to be right there,
and unfortunately, uh, overheard
everything
KIWOO
Cut, stop right there. Dad,
you’re overdoing it. The worrying
thing. Tone it down. I can tell
you’re acting.
KIWOO 
Action!
KITEK
I really didn’t mean to. I was
right there, and I just happened
to overhear.
YONKYO
What did you hear?
KITEK
I don’t know if I should say
KIWOO
I heard her say that she was 
diagnosed with tuberculosis!
YONKYO
Tuberculosis! Are you sure?
KITEK
What was it “Active pulmonary
tuberculosis.” She was talking on
the phone, and she seemed very
upset. Like she was angry at
herself.
KIWOO
I didn’t even know tuberculosis
was still a thing.
YONKYO
I didn’t even know tuberculosis
was still a thing.
KITEK
Neither did I. I remember years
ago we used to buy those seals for
Christmas, but I thought it was
all over. You should look it up.
Korea still has the highest
tuberculosis rate among OECD
countries.
YONKYO
I can’t believe that Mun-Kwang
How could she not tell me? I
can’t
KITEK
I wasn’t sure if I should say
anything, but I felt like you
should know. I mean, she was just
going about her business like
everything was normal. There are
young children in the house. DaSong is only ten. And this woman,
with her tuberculosis, is in the
kitchen making food and touching
the dishes
YONKYO
Stop!
Yon-Kyo goes into a shrieking fit.
YONKYO 
Please! No more!
KIWOO
If you find an opportunity  do
it. Just like we practiced.
It’ll be the cherry on top.
KIWOO
Our bloody finale.
YONKYO
Mr. Kim, you have to promise you
won’t tell my husband.
KITEK
Of course.
YONKYO
He can’t find out that I’ve been
keeping that walking lung disease
around the kids this whole time.
He’ll kill me.
KITEK
Don’t worry, Mrs. Park.
I don’t want to step out of line,
but I had a request as well. See,
I have nothing personal against
the housekeeper.
I only acted out of a moral
obligation to protect the health
and safety of the public. I
wouldn’t want Mr. Park to think
that I’m some kind of tattletale
YONKYO
Don’t worry. I’m not even going
to mention the tuberculosis to
Mun-Kwang. I’ll come up with a
completely unrelated reason. Let
her go quietly.
KITEK
I see.
YONKYO
It’s the best way. I’ve done it
before.
KITEK
Well, I trust your judgment.
YONKYO
Did you wash your hands, Mr. Kim?
DONGIK
Mr. Kim, do you know a place where
I can get some good short ribs?
Somewhere not too far.
KITEK
Of course.
You’ll be eating out tonight?
DONGIK
Yes. I suddenly had a craving for
juicy short ribs. Since I can’t
have them at home now.
DONGIK 
Our housekeeper used to make the
best short ribs.
KITEK
You mean the lady who just quit
yesterday?
DONGIK
She was with us for a long time.
I don’t know why she suddenly
left. Mrs. Park wouldn’t even
tell me. I mean, there’s no
shortage of housekeepers looking
for work so I guess we can just
hire another one. But it’s a real
pity. She was a great lady.
KITEK
I see.
DONGIK
She took care of all the little
things in the house. And she was
a tremendous cook. Most
importantly, she never crossed the
line. If there’s one thing I
hate, it’s people who cross the
line. Well, I guess she did have
one flaw.
She was a big eater. Ate twice as
much as other people. But I
suppose she worked twice as hard
to make up for that.
KITEK
I guess Mrs. Park will need to
find a new housekeeper soon.
DONGIK
Or the house will descend into
chaos. I guarantee she won’t be
able to survive a week without
one. Shambles, I tell you. My
clothes will start smelling
Mrs. Park definitely wins the
worst homemaker award. Doesn’t
know her way around a vacuum, and
her cooking is just  abysmal!
KITEK
But... you still love her, don’t
you?
DONGIK
Of course I love her! I don’t
know what else you’d call this.
KITEK
Then maybe you should look at
this
DONGIK
The Care? What is this?
KITEK
I just found out about them
recently too. It’s a membershipbased total care company.
Catering to families of VIP’s like
yourself. They provide maids, inhome caregivers, also drivers like
myself. From what I hear, they
select only the best. The most
experienced workers.
DONGIK
Looks very nice.
DONGIK 
The design is gorgeous. How did
you learn about this company, Mr.
Kim?
KITEK
They called me about working for
them. I guess I’m one of the more
experienced drivers around, so
they wanted to recruit me. I
turned them down because I was
already scheduled to meet you.
DONGIK
I see.
Well, I’m honored that you chose
me over such a reputable company.
I am forever grateful, Mr. Kim!
KITEK
You’re being ridiculous, sir.
DONGIK
Well, then. I guess I’ll just
give this to Mrs. Park.
KITEK
Yes, you should. But don’t say I
gave it to you.
You should tell her that you
looked it up yourself.
DONGIK
Good idea! That’s sure to earn me
some points. Thank you, Mr. Kim.
KITEK
They’re membership-only, so I
don’t think they have a website or
anything. There’s a consultation
number in the back
KIJUNG
Thank you for calling The Care.
This is senior advisor Yeo MyungSun. How may I help you?
CHUNGSOOK
She could have won an Oscar if she
became an actress.
KITEK
She has a nice voice, doesn’t she?
Just like me.
YONKYO
I heard I need to sign up for a
membership.
KIJUNG
That’s correct. We are a
membership-only service. If you
aren’t currently a member I can
guide you through the steps to
become one.
YONKYO
Sure, okay.
KIJUNG
Do you have a pen? I can give you
the list of forms you need to
submit.
DAHAE
Yay! Peaches!
CHUNGSOOK
Please have some too, Mr. Kevin.
KIWOO
Thank you, ma’am.
KIJUNG
Next time just knock and leave the
food outside.
CHUNGSOOK
Sorry
KIJUNG
Please don’t come in during the
lesson.
DASONG
Daddy! Did you get the walkie?
YONKYO
Da-Song! Lesson’s not over yet!
DONGIK
This guy. That’s all you think
about, isn’t it? Camping.
DASONG
Wow! T-667! Dope!
YONKYO
What’s all this stuff? We just
bought camping gear last year.
DONGIK
These are different. Might as
well complete the collection.
YONKYO
Da-Song! What’s wrong with you?
DASONG
Same smell. They smell exactly
the same!
YONKYO
Stop talking nonsense and go up to
your room. Ms. Jessica is
waiting.
DASONG
That’s weird. Ms. Jessica has the
same smell.
DONGIK
He’s a little out there.
KITEK
He scared me, the little punk.
Does this mean we all have to use
different soaps?
KIWOO
Maybe we should all wash our
clothes with different detergent.
Different fabric softeners too.
CHUNGSOOK
You mean I have to wash all of
your clothes separately? Fuck no.
KIJUNG
It won’t work. It’s the basement
smell.
KIJUNG 
The smell won’t go away unless we
leave this place.
KITEK
Forget about that. This is a good
problem to have. Think about our
lives before. It’s a dog-eat-dog
world out there. Hundreds of
college graduates compete for a
security guard job for Chrissake.
Not us. We are all gainfully
employed.
KIWOO
You’re right, Father. Cheers!
KITEK
Sure we may not be getting sixfigure salaries, but it’s no small
amount if you combine our wages.
The Parks are investing a great
part of their fortune in our
family. So let us give thanks to
Mr. Park, our generous employer.
A great man. And how can I forget
Min-Hyuk! How lucky that our son
is friends with such a thoughtful
young man. It’s all because of
him that FUCK! Do they always
have to ruin the moment?
The family members all turn toward 
KIWOO
That mother
KIJUNG
Oh, no. Here comes the rage
machine.
CHUNGSOOK
Why’s he acting tough all of a
sudden? Is he trying to kill
someone?
DASONG
The sky is mostly clear. Some
clouds visible, but no rain
clouds. Over.
Copy that. I’m here in the
kitchen, and Da-Hae has been
infected with a serious case of
‘duck lips.’ If she keeps pouting
like that she might actually turn
into a duck! She looks pissed,
over.
YONKYO
What’s with the face? Let’s all
try to have a good time.
DAHAE
Can’t I just stay home and study
with Kevin?
YONKYO
I know you hate camping, but it’s
Da-Song’s birthday. And you’re
his sister. Come on. It won’t be
so bad. We’ll build a fire. Sing
happy birthday at midnight. Blow
out candles under the stars.
It’ll be wonderful.
YONKYO 
I’m sure you know all of their
names by now.
Berry, Junie, Foofoo.
CHUNGSOOK
Of course. Berry and Junie only
eat Natural Balance Organic.
YONKYO
Yes. And Foofoo also needs this
 Kamaboko. Japanese crab cake.
YONKYO
And don’t hold the leash too short
when you’re walking Junie. He
needs to burn off that energy.
It’s easy if you think of him as
the canine version of Da-Song.
CHUNGSOOK
Don’t worry!
CHUNGSOOK
What are you doing out there?
Come inside.
KIWOO
You should try it. It’s nice to
be able to see the sky from your
own home.
KIWOO 
Water, Mom?
CHUNGSOOK
Sure.
KIWOO 
You want a water?
KIJUNG
Read my mind. Thanks, brodie.
KITEK
This is classy. Sipping whiskey
on a rainy day. Enjoying the
view.
CHUNGSOOK
What the hell are you doing? Why
are you mixing all the booze?
KITEK
This way Mr. Park won’t notice.
It’ll be too obvious if we drink
from only one bottle.
CHUNGSOOK
Nice to see you use that brain for
once.
KIJUNG
But you always get shitfaced when
you mix your drinks, Dad.
KITEK
Ki-Jung, that’s no way to talk to
your father. “Shitfaced.” No.
Not you too.
KIWOO
Let me pour you a shot, Father.
KIWOO 
It’s probably raining at the
campsite too. They must be having
a magical time. Da-Hae and her
family. Raindrops pattering the
tent. Playing the guitar...
CHUNGSOOK
By the way. What’s that yellow
notebook you’ve been carrying?
KIWOO
This?
KIWOO 
Da-Hae’s diary.
KIJUNG
Oh, my God. Why are you reading
that?
KIWOO
I just want to understand her on a
deeper level.
KIJUNG
Disgusting. You two going out or
something?
KIWOO
It’s serious. She likes me too.
I’m going to officially ask her
out when she goes to college. For
real.
KITEK
That’s my boy! That means this is
your future wife’s house! The
Parks will be your in-laws!
KIWOO
I guess that’s true.
CHUNGSOOK
You mean I’m fucking washing
dishes for my future in-laws?
KITEK
Hilarious! You’re washing your
future in-law’s tighty-whities!
Your daughter-in-law’s school
socks!
CHUNGSOOK
I like that girl. She’s nice.
Pretty. But not full of herself.
KIWOO
Well, as long as we’re getting
ahead of ourselves  If you think
about it, nowadays people barely
see their in-laws anyway. How
many times do you think families
see each other after their kids
get married?
KIJUNG
Crazy fuck.
KIWOO
You hear about people hiring
actors to stand in for their
parents at weddings. We’ll do the
same thing. A lot of TV extras do
that kind of work.
KIWOO 
She did too. Got paid to be one
of the bride’s guests. She went
to a bunch of weddings last year.
KIJUNG
I even caught a bouquet once.
First time I ever saw the bitch.
They pay ten bucks extra for the
bouquet.
CHUNGSOOK
That’s how you became such a good
actress!
KITEK
Sure the acting was good, but I
was surprised that the family was
so easy to trick.
CHUNGSOOK
Especially the missus. Not the
sharpest knife in the drawer. I
guess we should be thankful for
that
KITEK
Yes, she’s so innocent. And kind.
A rich person who’s also
kindhearted.
CHUNGSOOK
Not “also kindhearted.” She’s
kindhearted because she’s rich.
You get it?
CHUNGSOOK 
If I had all this, my heart would
be overflowing with kindness!
KITEK
That’s true. Your mother has a
point. Rich people are more
naive. They don’t have a bitter
bone in them. And the kids are
happier. No wiseasses.
CHUNGSOOK
It’s the money! Money cures all
the little wiseasses!
KITEK
Ki-Woo. That guy. What was his
name? Yun? The old driver.
KIWOO
Yes. Mr. Yun.
KITEK
He’s probably doing fine, right?
I’m sure he got a new job.
KIWOO
Of course. He’s young. Healthy.
Plenty of opportunities.
KITEK
Yeah, I’m sure he got an even
better job.
KIJUNG
Shut THE FUCK UP!
KIWOO
What the hell’s wrong with you?
KIJUNG
Fuck rich people! Just worry
about your own goddamn family!
KIJUNG 
Dad, please. Stop worrying about
other people. Look at me. Us.
Your son and daughter. We’re
right here!
KITEK
Did you see that! Right on cue!
KIWOO
“Dad, we’re right here!” POW!
Thunder and lightning! Awesome.
KIWOO 
Come on now, Jessica. Let’s
drink. Cheers!
KIWOO 
You know, Ki-Jung, when I saw you
upstairs in the bathroom You
looked so
KIJUNG
What? I looked so what?
KIWOO
You just looked so natural in that
bathtub. This house. It suits
you. You’re not like us.
KIJUNG
Fuck off.
KIWOO
It’s true, Dad. She was in the
tub watching TV, taking a fancy
bubble bath, and it just felt like
she belonged here.
KITEK
Is that right?
KIWOO
Imagine for a second that this is
our house. Let’s say we live
here. Which room would you like
to have? Out of all the beautiful
rooms designed by the great
Namgoong Hyunja, which one would
you want to be yours?
KIJUNG
I don’t know. Buy me the fucking
house first and I’ll think about
it.
KITEK
We’re ‘living’ here right now,
aren’t we? We’re here in the
living room, drinking and having a
good time, just like we would if
this was our place.
KIWOO
That’s true. We ARE currently
living here. For all intents and
purposes.
KITEK
This IS our house right now.
Nice and cozy.
CHUNGSOOK
You’re cozy, huh? That’s real
nice. What if Park comes back
right now?
He would skitter away like a
little cockroach.
CHUNGSOOK 
You kids know what I’m talking
about, right? Our apartment. How
when we turn on the kitchen
lights, the roaches all run away
and disappear under the cabinets.
He would be exactly like that!
KITEK
Fucking bitch. You’ve gone too
far this time.
KITEK 
What? I’m a cockroach?
KITEK 
I got you! I totally got you!
KITEK 
How was that, Spielberg? Pretty
realistic right? You like my
acting now?
KIWOO
Wow, Dad! You totally got me.
KIJUNG
Shit. You’re going to clean this
up, right?
CHUNGSOOK
I didn’t believe him for one
second.
KIWOO
Really? I thought he was really
going to kill you.
CHUNGSOOK
He could never do that. Your
father hasn’t a single backbone in
his body. The epitome of a
spineless mo
KIWOO
Who could it be at this time?
KITEK
What do you think it is?
CHUNGSOOK
What the
KIWOO
Why is she here?
CHUNGSOOK
It’s her, right? The old
housekeeper.
KIJUNG
Why do you think she’s here?
KITEK
What’s she doing? Why doesn’t she
just leave?
KIJUNG
It’s so loud. She could go on all
night
CHUNGSOOK
Hold on. I’m supposed to be here.
I can answer.
CHUNGSOOK 
Who is it?
MUNKWANG
Hi, how are you? I’m Mrs. Park
isn’t in, right?
MUNKWANG 
I used to work here. For many
many years. The monitor you’re
looking at. There’s a picture
above it, right? Berry, Junie,
Foofoo  from left to right.
CHUNGSOOK
That’s all fine, but how can I
help you? It’s very late.
MUNKWANG
You’re my replacement, aren’t you!
MUNKWANG
I’m so sorry to bother you at this
hour. There’s something in the
basement that I left behind, and I
was wondering if I could pick it
up. I was fired without any
notice so I didn’t have time to
gather all my things.
KIWOO
This wasn’t in our plan.
MUNKWANG
I’m sorry for the intrusion.
Thank you so much for letting me
in.
MUNKWANG 
The faucet drips if you turn it
that way.
CHUNGSOOK
The faucet’s fine. What do you
need to pick up?
MUNKWANG
Would you like to come down with
me?
CHUNGSOOK
No thanks. Just hurry up and get
what you need.
MUNKWANG
Can you give me a hand? Help me
push!
CHUNGSOOK
Huh?
MUNKWANG
He’s going to die! Please!
CHUNGSOOK
What’s going on
MUNKWANG
Just help me first!
CHUNGSOOK
Wait. Maybe this is the problem.
MUNKWANG
Babe! Babe!
We get glimpses of the dark underground bunker as Mun-Kwang
waves around the flashlight on her cell phone  low ceiling,
gray walls, a small passageway...
MUNKWANG 
Kun-Sae!
KUNSAE
Stop yelling. I’m okay...
MUNKWANG
No, you’re not. You’re not okay!
Why are you in the dark? Why did
you turn off the lights?
KUNSAE
We have to conserve energy. It
all comes out of Mr. Park’s
pocket.
MUNKWANG
It’s fine. We’re okay.
MUNKWANG 
She’s a friend. She helped me get
in here. It was the damn wires.
They were stuck under the cabinet.
KUNSAE
No wonder.
I tried everything but I couldn’t
get it to open. I couldn’t go up
to the kitchen.
MUNKWANG
How many days have you gone
without food? I’m so sorry, babe!
CHUNGSOOK
What are you people up to? Why
are you
MUNKWANG
I know how this looks. You must
think we’re crazy. But please,
Chung-Sook. Have some pity. Us
domestic workers, we’re sisters
CHUNGSOOK
How the hell do you know my name?
MUNKWANG
Da-Song and I still text from time
to time. I came here because I
knew the family would be on a
camping trip. I wanted to talk to
you alone.
MUNKWANG 
Don’t worry, sis. No one knows
I’m here.
MUNKWANG 
I cut the wires on the
surveillance camera on my way in.
That’s good, right? Huh, big sis?
CHUNGSOOK
Wait. Hold on. Aren’t you older
than me?
MUNKWANG
I was born in 74. Year of the
tiger. My name is Mun-Kwang.
MUNKWANG 
This is my husband Oh Kun-Sae.
CHUNGSOOK
So the whole time you were working
here, you were smuggling food down
from the kitchen?
MUNKWANG
No! Everything he ate came from
my pocket. From the money I made
here. I never stole anything!
CHUNGSOOK
Sure. And how long has he been
down here? Your husband.
MUNKWANG
Let’s see About four years?
CHUNGSOOK
You gotta be kidding me.
KUNSAE
Four years, three months, and
seventeen days to be exact!
MUNKWANG
That’s right. It’s already June.
He started living here after Mr.
Namgoong moved out four years ago.
Before Da-Song’s family moved in.
Chung-Sook looks around the room. It has a toilet, sink, small
fridge, an old-fashioned TV set... Enough amenities to survive
underground.
MUNKWANG 
A lot of these rich people, they
build bunkers and secret rooms in
their homes. You know, in case
the North Koreans invade, or in
case creditors come knocking on
their doors. Maybe Mr. Namgoong
felt embarrassed about building
such a room. He didn’t mention it
to the Parks when he sold the
house.
CHUNGSOOK
Huh.
MUNKWANG
Nobody in the house knew about the
room. Except me.
CHUNGSOOK
Some balls you got. Well, now I
know too! And I know what I’m
going to do!
CHUNGSOOK 
Call the fucking cops.
MUNKWANG
No! Please sis!
We’re all in the same boat, aren’t
we? We all need a little help to
get by.
CHUNGSOOK
I’m not your fucking sister,
bitch. And I don’t need nobody’s
help.
MUNKWANG
Well, I do! I don’t have a house.
I don’t have money. All I have is
a mountain of debt.
CHUNGSOOK
What do you want me to do about
it?
MUNKWANG
He’s been down here for four
years, and the loan sharks still
won’t let go. They’re obsessed.
They say they’re going to kill
him!
CHUNGSOOK
You borrowed from loan sharks?
KUNSAE
It’s all my fault.
I started a cake shop  Taiwanese
Castella  and it completely
bankrupted us.
MUNKWANG
Please, take this.
CHUNGSOOK
What is this?
MUNKWANG
It’s not much, I know. But I can
send you money every month. All I
ask is that you come down here
every other day and leave him
something to eat. Actually no.
Once a week is fine. There’s a
little fridge down here so
CHUNGSOOK
Are you crazy? You people are
unbelievable Get away from me.
Chung-Sook lifts her phone.
CHUNGSOOK 
I’m going to call the cops.
MUNKWANG
What the hell?
KUNSAE
Honey, who are all these people?
MUNKWANG
Ms. Jessica? Mr. Kim... What’s
everyone doing down here?
KIWOO
Ow! Dad, my foot!
MUNKWANG
Now I get it.
I knew something wasn’t right
KIWOO
Ow! Dad, my foot!
Ki-Woo’s face and voice are clearly recorded on video.
MUNKWANG
Now I get it. You’re all a
family. A family that scams
people together.
KIWOO
It’s not like that
MUNKWANG
I knew something was off when Yun
was fired for no reason. You
despicable
CHUNGSOOK
Listen, sis
MUNKWANG
I’m not your sister, you liferuining bitch.
MUNKWANG 
Why don’t I send this little video
to Mrs. Park right now?
KITEK
There’s probably no reception down
here.
KIJUNG
Actually it’s pretty good.
KITEK
Fuck.
KIWOO
Please. We really need these
jobs, and we went through a lot to
get them. We’re not scam artists.
We’re
MUNKWANG
Shut up! I don’t give a shit! I
don’t care if we all go to prison.
I’ll fucking end everything right
here!
KITEK
Shut UP!!!!
KITEK 
Are you crazy, lady!
KITEK 
Imagine how upset the Parks would
be if they saw the video.
They are nice people! And they’ve
shown nothing but kindness! Why
would you do that to them!
MUNKWANG
What the
KITEK
Erase it. Now. If you erase it
Then we can talk. Then I will
consider your demands
MUNKWANG
What’s wrong with your husband?
CHUNGSOOK
I apologize on his behalf. Now
let’s all calm down
MUNKWANG
Back off! Or I’m going to hit
send!
MUNKWANG 
Let’s get you upstairs. You need
some fresh air.
KUNSAE
Sounds good.
MUNKWANG
All of you go upstairs and stay in
one place. If you move one inch
out of my sight, I’m hitting send!
KUNSAE
It’s funny. Your phone. It’s
like a nuclear button.
MUNKWANG
What are you talking about?
KUNSAE
They all hide their tails when you
say you’ll press the button.
You’re like North Korea. The
phone is Kim Jong-Un’s nuke!
MUNKWANG
Upon seeing the atrocious acts
committed by the family of
depraved bandits on mobile camera,
our Dear Leader Kim Jong-Un
determined to deliver fiery
justice
KUNSAE
I missed your impressions.
MUNKWANG
Ignoring the cowardly ruling of
the United Nations Security
Council, our Dear Leader announced
that he would execute the family
of delinquents by firing squad.
KUNSAE
No one does commie impressions
better than you. I love you,
babe.
MUNKWANG
What are you looking at! Keep
your heads down!
MUNKWANG 
Scumbags. Look at this
debauchery. This is how you treat
the sublime living room created by
the great Namgoong Hyunja?
KUNSAE
A great living room it is...
Remember, honey? How we would sit
here when the weather was nice,
looking out at the garden. So
enchanting.
MUNKWANG
It was. Park would be at work.
The kids at school. Yon-Kyo would
go out shopping, and the house
would be so quiet. You would come
up, and we would have tea
together.
KUNSAE
Yes. Royal Milk Tea.
MUNKWANG
We would enjoy the view, listening
to Rachmaninoff on the bluetooth
speaker
CHUNGSOOK
Hello?
YONKYO
You’re there! You know how to
make japaguri, right? Spicy
jajang udon?
CHUNGSOOK
Japaguri?
YONKYO
It’s Da-Song’s favorite. If you
start cooking now, it’ll be ready
by the time we get there. There’s
some Prime flank steak in the
fridge so you should put that in
too.
YONKYO 
It was complete hell. The stream
at the campsite flooded and we had
to pack up our tents, but Da-Song
just refused to leave. He was
crying and yelling
We barely got him in the car, and
now we’re on our way. I’m
counting on the japaguri! It has
to be ready!
CHUNGSOOK
So You’re almost here?
YONKYO
Eight minutes, according to
navigation.
CHUNGSOOK
I see... Eight minutes.
YONKYO
You should start now. You’re the
best!
CHUNGSOOK
What the hell is a japaguri?
KIJUNG
Look it up. The recipe’s online.
KIJUNG 
What do we do?
KIWOO
I don’t know... This wasn’t part
of the plan.
KUNSAE
Ow!
KITEK
Move! Hurry!
KUNSAE
You don’t have to do this. Let’s
all sit down and talk.
KITEK
I’ll take care of them. You go
and help Ki-Jung.
KIWOO
Okay.
YONKYO
Da-Song! Look what Chung-Sook
made! It’s japaguri, your
favorite!
YONKYO
This is ridiculous. You should
eat this.
CHUNGSOOK
Oh, thank you...
YONKYO
Wait. No. I’ll give it to DongIk. You put the steak in, right?
KITEK
What the hell are you doing?
KUNSAE
Mr. Park is home. This is my
welcome home ritual.
KUNSAE 
What are you staring at? I do
this everyday.
YONKYO
Babe, have some japaguri. I put
some steak in.
DONGIK
No thanks. I’m going up to take a
shower.
KUNSAE
Welcome back, what a hard day you
must have had at work / Welcome
back, Mr. Park we love you so much
YONKYO
That sensor is all bonkers.
Yon-Kyo talks to Chung-Sook as she shoves japaguri and flank
steak in her mouth. She looks up.
YONKYO 
I guess there are still some
things you need to learn about us.
You think we’re weird right?
We go out of our way to indulge
Da-Song. Treat him like some kind
of crown prince.
CHUNGSOOK
Not at all
YONKYO
You have to understand. Da-Song
needs special care. He’s... not
well. We’ve been helping him with
trauma therapy and art therapy.
You see, he went through a
traumatic event when he was
little.
CHUNGSOOK
What kind of
YONKYO
Do you believe in ghosts?
CHUNGSOOK
Ghosts?
YONKYO
When Da-Song was in first grade,
he saw a ghost.
YONKYO 
That year we threw him a big
birthday party at home. At night,
when we were all asleep, Da-Song
snuck back down to the kitchen
because he couldn’t stop thinking
about the cake. You see, the
fresh cream on that cake was just
divine.
CHUNGSOOK
Right.
YONKYO
He was crouched over there in
front of the refrigerator, eating
cake with his fingers when 
Chung-Sook is riveted.
YONKYO 
He saw something. Over there. In
the living room window. A dark
figure
CHUNGSOOK
In the garden?
YONKYO
No, in the kitchen.
Yon-Kyo points to the living room window.
YONKYO 
See? You can see the kitchen
reflected in the window.
CHUNGSOOK
My goodness.
YONKYO
He saw a dark figure looking over
his shoulders. A ghost.
I heard a scream and rushed down
the stairs.
When I found him, his eyes were
rolled back, and he was foaming at
the mouth, shaking uncontrollably

CHUNGSOOK
Oh my gosh.
YONKYO
Have you seen a child going
through a seizure? It’s awful.
If you don’t perform first aid in
the first fifteen minutes, it’s
over. You have to take him to the
hospital as soon as you can.
Dong-Ik was away on a business
trip, and I was all by myself.
Anyway, after that horrible
experience, we’ve tried to go away
for his birthday every year. Last
year we went to my parents’ house.
This year, camping
Now it’s all gone to crap.
CHUNGSOOK
I see.
YONKYO
Dong-Ik doesn’t take it seriously.
Growing pains, he says. And he
says living in a haunted house
actually brings good fortune.
Good for business or something.
You know what though? Business
has been very good these past few
years. It’s funny
KITEK
God... I can’t believe you lived
here for so long. I guess you had
no choice...
KUNSAE
Plenty of people live underground.
More if you count semi-underground
apartments!
KITEK
So what was your plan? You didn’t
even have one, did you?
KUNSAE
I like it here. It almost feels
like I grew up here. This might
as well be my official address.
KUNSAE 
Please. You have to let me stay
here.
KUNSAE 
Please. Talk to my wife. We
don’t have to fight.
Where did she go? She didn’t mean
what she said. The woman really
has a heart of gold. She stood by
me the whole time I was in here.
Four long years
DAHAE
You’re unbelievable.
YONKYO
What?
DAHAE
You didn’t even ask me. I like
japaguri too.
YONKYO
I just
DAHAE
Da-Song didn’t want it so you
offered it to Chung-Sook. Then
you gave it to Dad. Then instead
of asking me, you decided to eat
it all by yourself. What, I
didn’t cross your mind?
CHUNGSOOK
Da-Song! Slow down!
YONKYO
Da-Song! Are you crazy!
DONGIK
Da-Song Park!
I can’t believe this.
DAHAE
What the fuck is going on here?
YONKYO
You should go sleep in the room.
We’ll stay here with Da-Song.
DONGIK
You too. Stop looking at your
phone and go to your room.
DONGIK 
Dad to Da-Song, Dad to Da-Song.
Currently standing by in the
living room. I’ll be here all
night so call me if there’s an
emergency.
DASONG
Copy that. Over and out.
DONGIK
This is incredible. You don’t
think the teepee will leak, do
you?
YONKYO
I bought it directly from an
American vendor. I think it
should be okay.
DONGIK
Your son is quite unpredictable.
Never easy, I’ll say.
YONKYO
He’s been getting better... Look.
Signing him up for the Cub Scouts
definitely paid off. See how fast
he set up that tent.
DONGIK
Let’s just sleep here on the sofa
tonight. We’ll be able to see the
tent from here.
YONKYO
That sounds good. That way we can
keep an eye on Da-Song.
DONGIK
Hold on.
I know that smell.
YONKYO
What?
DONGIK
This is Mr. Kim’s smell.
YONKYO
Mr. Kim? Are you sure?
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
DONGIK
I guess you don’t know. I sit
behind him every day so I know the
smell.
YONKYO
Like poor people smell?
DONGIK
No. It’s not that strong. It’s
more like a subtle aroma that
seeps into the air
YONKYO
Like old people smell?
DONGIK
No, no. How should I put it
Maybe the smell of an old radish
pickle? Or that smell when you’re
washing a dirty rag?
DONGIK 
I mean I like his driving. And
the man never crosses the line.
Sometimes he teeters very close,
but he never actually crosses it.
That’s all great. But that smell.
It definitely crosses the line.
It just creeps into the backseat
and surrounds you
YONKYO
You think that’s what Da-Song was
talking about?
DONGIK
It’s hard to explain. I smell it
when I ride the subway sometimes.
YONKYO
I haven’t ridden the subway in
forever.
DONGIK
There’s this unique smell that
subway commuters have
YONKYO
What are you doing?
DONGIK
It feels like we’re in the
backseat of a car, doesn’t it?
YONKYO
Clockwise.
DONGIK
Do you have a pair of really cheap
panties?
YONKYO
Cheap panties?
DONGIK
Those panties that Yun left
behind. Something like that.
Real cheap and tacky.
YONKYO
No, I don’t have something so
crude.
DONGIK
I must be a pervert. I get hard
thinking about those cheap, trashy
pair of underpants.
YONKYO
Where would I find something so
horrendous.
Down.
DASONG
Mayday! Mayday! Dad, come in!
DONGIK
What is it?
YONKYO
Is that Da-Song ? What’s going
on?
DASONG
I can’t go to sleep. Over.
DONGIK
So come inside! Let’s all go to
sleep in our comfy beds.
DASONG
No!
KIJUNG
So what did you do?
KITEK
What are you talking about?
KIJUNG
The basement.
KITEK
I tied them up so they can’t come
out.
KIJUNG
What are we going to do?
KIJUNG 
What do we do now? What’s the
goddamn plan?
KIWOO
What would Min-Hyuk do?
KIJUNG
Min-Hyuk wouldn’t have gotten
himself in this mess in the first
place!
KITEK
Calm down. Both of you.
Ki-Jung seethes.
KITEK 
We made it out of that house,
didn’t we?
KIWOO
We did.
KITEK
No one else knows about what
happened in the house. Am I
right?
KITEK 
So as far as I’m concerned nothing
happened in there. Do you
understand?
KITEK 
I know what I’m doing. Daddy has
a plan. So you two just erase
everything that happened today
from your memory.
KIJUNG
Okay.
KITEK
Let’s go home and wash up.
KIWOO
Ow!
KITEK
Were you shocked? Don’t touch it!
Don’t touch the windows! Just get
what you need!
KUNSAE
Mmm-mmmm!
MUNKWANG
Vomiting is a symptom of
It’s supposed to be a symptom of
Honey
Chung-Sook. She That bitch
kicked me in the face
KIWOO
Hey, Dad.
KITEK
Hey...
KIWOO
So
KIWOO 
Your plan. What is it?
KITEK
What are you talking about?
KIWOO
You said you had a plan. What are
we going to do about
The basement.
KITEK
Do you want to know how you make a
foolproof plan?
KIWOO
How?
KITEK
Don’t plan at all. Have no plan.
KITEK 
If you plan, something will always
go wrong. That’s life.
Look around. Do you think these
people got up this morning and
said “Tonight I’m going to sleep
on a dirty floor with hundreds of
strangers”? But look where they
are now. Look where we are.
Ki-woo is hardly consoled.
KITEK 
That’s why you should never plan.
If you don’t have a plan, you
can’t fail. You can’t do anything
wrong. Doesn’t matter if you kill
someone or commit fucking treason.
Nothing fucking matters. You
understand?
KIWOO
I’m sorry, Dad.
KITEK
For what?
KIWOO
Everything. I’m going to make it
right.
KITEK
Stop talking nonsense.
Why are you hugging that thing?
KIWOO
This?
KIWOO 
It wants to be with me.
KIWOO 
It’s true. It keeps following me.
KITEK
Get some sleep.
KIWOO
I knew it was a sign when Min-Hyuk
gave it to me. A symbolic gift...
YONKYO
Jessica! Sorry to call you so
early on a Sunday. Are you free
for lunch today? We’re planning a
surprise party for Da-Song.
KIJUNG
You’re having a birthday party?
YONKYO 
Yes. Da-Song would be so thrilled
to see you there.
YONKYO
The food will be amazing. Pasta,
gratin, salmon steak... You know
I’m an excellent chef, right? You
have to come.
KIJUNG 
Sure...
YONKYO
You have to be here by one
o’clock at the latest. And we’ll
count today as a lesson.
You know what I mean?
See you very soon!
DAHAE
Hey, Mom. The birthday party
Should I invite Kevin?
YONKYO
What an excellent idea! Why not?
You call him.
DAHAE
On it!
YONKYO
Sleep, sleep. You had a long
night. You need some more rest.
DONGIK
Thanks.
Don’t you have to do the rounds?
YONKYO
Yep. Wine shop, bakery, florist,
grocery store I’m on top of it.
I already called Mr. Kim and told
him to come early. I’m going to
pay him extra for today.
DONGIK
Perfect.
YONKYO
I want you to go to the storage
basement. We should have about
ten party tables in there.
CHUNGSOOK
Okay...
YONKYO
Let’s bring them all out. Clean
them so they’re bright and shiny.
We’ll set them up in a semi-circle
around Da-Song’s tent
Crane Formation! You know, right?
The formation that General Yi Soon
Shin famously used during the
Battle of Hansan Island.
Think of Da-Song’s tent as a
Japanese battleship. We’ll
surround it in a semi-circle, like
the wings of a crane. The
barbecue grill will go next to the
tent
That sounds great. Bring your
husband too! And please  don’t
bring any gifts.
I just want you to come and enjoy
the food!
Come. You can take a break from
cooking today.
Yes, of course. Daytime is the
best time for vino!
Well, we’d be so grateful if you
could sing a song at the party.
No dress code. It’s just a casual
affair. You can come in your
pajamas if you want.
And please, no gifts. I just want
you to come and enjoy. That’ll be
the best gift for us.
You have a Mini Cooper, right?
Great. We can squeeze it in next
to our car. It’ll fit just fine.
DONGIK
He’s still sleeping.
YONKYO
Did you see the sky today?
Crystal clear. Zero air
pollution. Rain washed it all
away. Of course camping was a
major fail because of the rain,
but we get to have a garden party
instead, yay! It was actually a
blessing in disguise.
I almost forgot. Please please
please don’t bring any presents.
You have to promise.
DAHAE
You were somewhere else, weren’t
you?
KIWOO
What?
DAHAE
When we were kissing just now.
You were somewhere else. Right?
KIWOO
No...
DAHAE
Stop lying. You’re still thinking
about something else.
KIWOO
They’re all so gorgeous. Even
though they had to come at the
last minute. So cool. Laid back.
KIWOO 
Da-Hae.
DAHAE
Yeah?
KIWOO
Do I look like I belong here?
DAHAE
What do you mean?
KIWOO
Do I look like I belong in this
house?
DAHAE
Where are you going?
KIWOO
I need to go downstairs.
DAHAE
Stay. Let’s hang out.
KIWOO
I need to go down.
DAHAE
Those people are boring.
DAHAE 
Just stay with me.
KIWOO
Not there. Further down.
DAHAE
Whoa. What is that thing?
DONGIK
I can’t believe we’re doing this.
Look at us. A couple of middleaged men, wearing silly costumes
KITEK
It’s fine...
DONGIK
I’m really sorry, Mr. Kim. Mrs.
Park made me do this. I didn’t
have a choice.
It’s really simple. There’s going
to be a cake ceremony, and
Jessica, the art teacher, is going
to bring out the cake. She’s
walking, walking, walking, she’s
going to present the cake Then
we appear from the trees swinging
our axes, ambushing her! Because,
you know, we’re the bad guys.
KITEK
Sure.
DONGIK
At that moment, Da-Song, the good
Indian, attacks us with his axe.
A battle ensues, and Da-Song
heroically saves Ms. Jessica and
the cake! Everybody applauds.
You get the idea. I know it’s
ridiculous.
KITEK
I guess Mrs. Park enjoys throwing
parties.
DONGIK
I suppose she does. She put a lot
of effort into Da-Song’s birthday
this year.
KITEK
How thoughtful of her. And you
too.
KITEK 
What can you do, I guess. You
love them, right?
DONGIK
Mr. Kim, you’re technically
working today, aren’t you?
KITEK
Yes, sir.
DONGIK
Then just think of this as part of
the job.
KITEK
Mr. Park. I think you went over
the line.
DONGIK
What did you say?
KITEK
No. I mean this.
KIJUNG
Have you been down there?
CHUNGSOOK
No, I’ve been too busy.
KIJUNG
Shouldn’t we try to talk to them?
Try to reach an agreement.
CHUNGSOOK
I think so too. We all got too
emotional yesterday.
KIJUNG
I’ll go down there and see how
they’re doing.
CHUNGSOOK
Here. Take this with you. I made
it for them just in case. They’ll
be more willing to talk if their
stomachs are full.
YONKYO 
Jessica! I was looking for you!
What are you doing there? Come
out here.
This cake is very symbolic. It
has a therapeutic significance,
you know, related to Da-Song’s
trauma. I want you to bring it
out, Jessica. It has to be you.
It’ll be the highlight of the day!
DAHAE
Kevin! Kevin, where are you?
KUNSAE
Don’t move!
KUNSAE 
Chung-Sook! Where are you! Come
out you fucking bitch!
CHUNGSOOK
Ki-Jung! Wake up!
CHUNGSOOK 
Put pressure on the wound, KiJung! You have to stop the blood!
KITEK
Help! Please help us!
YONKYO
Mr. Kim, get the car! We can’t
wait for an ambulance!
DONGIK
Kim! Get the car!
YONKYO
Fifteen minutes!
DONGIK
Keys! Give me the keys!
The keys!
KIWOO
He was the first person I saw when
I woke up a month later.
A detective. Although he didn’t
look like one.
Then I saw a doctor who didn’t
look like a doctor. He told me
one of the side effects of brain
surgery was laughing for no
reason.
Maybe that’s why I laughed when I
heard that Ki-Jung died. They
said she died from loss of blood.
Ki-Woo chuckles and grabs his stomach as he pushes an IV pole
down the hall.
I also laughed when Mom and I
received our sentences. We
avoided the slew of charges they
threw at us  forgery, home
invasion, voluntary manslaughter,
which we argued was self defense
 and walked away with probation.
Same when I saw Ki-Jung again for
the first time since the incident.
I laughed then too.
REPORTER1
The murders, which had no apparent
motive and took place in a quiet,
upper-class neighborhood, have
confounded the police. The other
suspect, an unidentified homeless
male, was murdered himself at the
scene, further shrouding
REPORTER2
The driver, Kim, was known to have
a good relationship with his
employer Park, and police have yet
to narrow down a concrete motive.
Kim’s whereabouts are still
unclear after he was last seen
fleeing the scene, and police
continue searching for leads. His
cell signal was last active at the
crime scene
KIWOO 
Of course neither Mom or I have
had any contact with you since
that day.
I just feel awful those poor
detectives who have to follow us
all day.
I did have a strong feeling about
where you might be.
So when the season changed and the
news slowed down  and when the
detectives finally stopped
trailing us  I started climbing
the mountain.
You can see the house pretty well
from there.
I don’t know why, but that day I
just felt like staying longer.
Dash. Dot. Dash-dash
KITEK 
Dear Son. Perhaps you, if no one
else, will be able to read this
letter
You were a Boy Scout so I’m hoping
this will somehow reach you.
How is your health? Your mother
I’m not too worried about. I’m
sure she’s healthy as an ox.
I’m doing well too. Although I
cry often when I think of Ki-Jung.
I still can’t believe what
happened that day. It almost
feels like a dream.
I knew, as soon as I ran out of
that gate, where I had to go.
Even in the complete madness, I
had the foresight to grab some
water and food
I realized only later that a house
with such a morbid history would
not be appealing to potential
buyers. I would have to stay in
an empty house for a long time.
One good thing about being alone
was that I was finally able to
give her a proper funeral.
Tree burials are all the rage
these days, so I guess no one can
say I didn’t give her a proper
farewell.
The real estate agents were
smarter than I thought. They
somehow managed to sell the house
to a family that just moved to
Korea.
The parents both work, and the
kids are at school most of the
day, which should have made them
ideal housemates for me. But
unfortunately they have a live-in
maid, and I risk my life every
night for the tiny window of
opportunity I have to venture
outside.
Luckily, Germans don’t only eat
German food. I thought I would
have to eat sausage and beer for
the rest of my life.
When you’re in here, you lose your
sense of reality.
But today was a good day. I wrote
this letter to you.
Take care, Son.
KIWOO 
Father. Today I made a plan.
A long-term plan.
I’m going to make a lot of money.
First I’ll need to go to college.
Then I’ll get a job and get
married. But ultimately, I want
to get rich.
And when I get rich, I will buy
this house.
We’ll pick a sunny day to move in.
Then all you have to do is walk up
the stairs.
Come out, Dad.
But I have a problem, Father  I
have no idea how to get this
letter to you.
