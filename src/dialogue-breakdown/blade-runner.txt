K
Hope you don’t mind me taking the
liberty. Wind’s a bit unkind out there.
I was careful not to track in any dirt.
SAPPER
I do not mind dirt. I do mind
unannounced visits. You police?
K
Sapper Morton... Civic number NK680514?
SAPPER
I’m a farmer.
K
I saw that. What do you farm?
SAPPER
This is a protein farm. Wallace design.
It only takes the one to start.
Parthenogenic strain. Constant doubling.
They’ll fill as much dirt as you can wet.
K
Is that what I smell?
SAPPER
Grow this just for me. Garlic.
K
Garlic.
SAPPER
Whole town farmed it back once. Smelled
this good a hundred miles in circle.
Try some?
K
No thank you. I prefer to keep a cold
stomach until the hard part of the day’s
behind me. How long you been here?
SAPPER
Since ’20. Came by it honest too if
that’s what you’re after.
K
But you weren’t a farmer prior.
That bag... colonial medical use, isn’t
it? Military issue. Heat resistant.
Where were you... Calantha? Must’ve
been brutal. Not many who survived
bothered to come back to ground.
SAPPER
Planning on taking me in? Huh? Take a
look inside. See what they missed.
K
If taking you in is an option, I’d much
prefer that over the alternative.
You had to know it’d be someone in time.
Sorry it’s me.
SAPPER
Good as any.
K
If you’d look up and to the left please.
Please don’t get up.
SAPPER
How does it feel, killing your own kind?
K
I don’t retire my own kind. We don’t
run. Only old models run.
SAPPER
You new models. You’re happy scraping
the shit. You’ve never seen a miracle.
K
Photograph everything.
K
Madam, please.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
You’re hurt. I’m not paying for that.
K
I’ll glue it.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
And?
One of the tail end Nexus 8s before
Prohibition. Looks like he could take
your head off.
K
He thought about it.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
Field medic, standard ocular ID upgrades,
open end lifespan, now ended. He went
AWOL after Calantha with a few more in
his outfit I wouldn’t mind closing out.
Just him?
K
Just the one.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
Between the retirement and the bleed
you’ll see a tidy bonus. Less mine.
K
Can I get it today?
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
I don’t know what you all do with cash in
pocket anyway. Come on home for your
baseline.
K
Moment, Madam.
K
There. 30 meters to maximum depth.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
What is that?
K
It’s down in deep. Send a dig team,
Madam?
Should I find a shovel, spare your night?
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
You better get back ahead of the storm.

Thank you, Sir.
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
K! I didn’t hear you. You’re early!
K
You want me to come back?
JOI (O.S.)
Go scrub.
JOI (O.S.)
How was your meeting?
K
The usual. How was your day?
JOI (O.S.)
I’m getting cabin fever.
K
I had an accident at work. Think I
ruined my shirt.
JOI (O.S.)
I’m sure I can fix that for you. Let me
take a look at it.
K
You want a drink first? I need a drink.
JOI (O.S.)
Mmm-hmm. Pour me one, will you.
JOI (O.S.)
I’m trying a new recipe. I think you’ll
like it.
K
Don’t fuss.
JOI (O.S.)
Too late. I hope it isn’t dry.
JOI (O.S.) (cont’d)
Did you know this song was released in
1966 on Reprise Records? It was number 1
on the charts... Won’t be much longer.
Finishing touches.
Ok, ready! I think you’ll like it.
K
I told you not to fuss.
JOI (O.S.)
And yet.
Voila. Bon appetit.
I missed you, babysweet.
K
Honey, it’s beautiful.
JOI
Just put your feet up. Relax.
Was a day, huh?
K
It was a day.
JOI
Would you read to me. I’m dying to know
what happens next.
K
You hate that book.
JOI
I don’t want to read either. Let’s
dance.
You wanna dance, or you wanna open your
present?
A present?
What’s the occasion?
K
Our anniversary.
JOI
Is it?
K
Happy Anniversary.
JOI
An emanator.
K
We don’t need a hard line anymore. Try
it on.
JOI
Oh thank you thank you thank you!
K
You can go anywhere in the world. What
do you want to see first?
JOI
Stay like this. The light catches your
skin. You look like me. If you’re not
too cold...
I’m so happy when I’m with you.
K
You don’t have to say that.
JOSHI (V.O.)
Your dig came through... Get down here.
NANDEZ
Your box is a military footlocker issued
to Sapper Morton, creatively repurposed
as an ossuary. Box of bones,
meticulously cleaned and laid to rest
about 30 years gone. Nothing else in it
but hair. She’s pre-Blackout so DeNAbase
doesn’t give an ID.
K
She?
JOSHI
Even better. She plus one.
NANDEZ
Cause of death, Coco --
COCO
No breaks, hi K, no signs of trauma...
except...
Fracture through the ilium. Narrow birth
canal, baby probably got stuck. The bone
should re-bond if you live long enough...
she didn’t.
JOSHI
She was pregnant.
K
So he didn’t kill her.
COCO
She died in childbirth. Guess she wasn’t
meant for motherhood.
K
Go back. Closer. Closer. That. What’s
that?
COCO
Notching on the iliac crest. Fine point,
like a scalpel. Looks like an emergency
c-section... Cuts are clean. No sign of
struggle.
K
He was a combat medic. Maybe he tried to
save her. Just didn’t.
NANDEZ
He didn’t seem like the saving type.
COCO
He took the time to bury her. A
sentimental skinjob.
Sorry.
JOSHI
Didn’t seem the Daddy type either. So
where’s the kid? You scan the whole
field?
NANDEZ
Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.
COCO
Maybe he ate it.
JOSHI
That’s not possible. She was -- a
Replicant. Pregnant. It was pregnant.
The world’s built on a wall that
separates kind. Tell either side there’s
no wall -- you bought a war -- or a
slaughter.
So what you saw. Didn’t. Happen.
K
Yes Madam.
JOSHI
What isn’t possible can’t be.
K
Yes Madam.
JOSHI
There’s an order to things. This turns
it. That’s what we do here, we keep
order.
K
You want it gone?
JOSHI
Everything.
K
Even the child.
JOSHI
We have to break the mold. All trace.
Numbers, incepts. Erase. Everything.
You have something to say?
K
I’ve never retired something born.
JOSHI
What’s the difference?
K
To be born is to have a soul.
JOSHI
You telling me no?
K
I wasn’t aware I had a choice.
JOSHI
Attaboy.
Hey. You’re getting on fine without one.
K
What’s that Madam?
JOSHI
A soul.
K
Checking on an old serial number.
FILE CLERK
You have anything else? You have
confirmation DNA?
K
I have hair.
FILE CLERK
An old one. Pre-Blackout, this is gonna
be tough. Not much from then and what’s
there is thick milky.
LUV
You can customize them as much as you’d
like. “As human as you want them to be.”
But the Placers is strictly a drill site,
isn’t it? Off-world mining rock wants a
strong back and an utter lack of selfsufficiency, I wouldn’t waste your money
on intelligence or attachment or appeal.
Unless you’d like to add some pleasure
models to your order?
Excuse me a moment.
FILE CLERK
Everyone remembers where they were at the
Blackout. You?
K
Before my time.
FILE CLERK
Home with my folks, terrified -- ten days
of darkness, every machine stopped cold.
When the lights came back we were wiped
clean as any. Photos, files, every bit
of data -- gone. Bank records too,
didn’t mind that, couldn’t prove our loan
and had to give us the house outright...
K
Shame. You must’ve been adorable.
FILE CLERK
Here. Pretty fractured, not much on it.
One of the last gens pre-Prohibition.
B’s across the board, standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.
K
And?
FILE CLERK
No remarks. Unremarkable.
K
Unremarkable. That’s all you know.
FILE CLERK
Brown hair.
LUV (O.S.)
There must be something else we can find
for him.
Another prodigal serial number returns.
A 30 year old open case finally closed is
a curiosity and relief. Thank you,
Officer. I’m here for Mr. Wallace.
I’m Luv.
K
He named you. You must be special.
LUV
I’m here for Mr. Wallace.
LUV
The ancient models give the entire
endeavor a bad name.
What a gift, don’t you think? From Mr.
Wallace to the world. The outer colonies
would never have flourished had he not
bought Tyrell, revivified the technology.
To say the least of what we do.
LUV
I see you are also a customer. Are you
satisfied with our product?
K
She’s very realistic.
LUV
Here -- all the junk is in here. Lucky
for you Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder. A
shard in the right shape can be a gem.
No one’s been down here in ages.
LUV
All our memory bearings from the time.
All fairly well damaged in the Blackout.
But there are sometimes fragments.
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Have a little boy--butterfly
collection plus the killing--
--Feel a wasp crawling on
your wrist--
--Just answer the question--
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
--I’d take him to the doctor--
--I should be enough for him--
this testing whether I’m a
replicant or a lesbian--
It was unclear what she was, at least to
someone. This was a test. We were
difficult to spot then.
Was there anything unusual about how you
found her? To warrant an official
investigation?
K
Like you say, old serial numbers.
Everyone sleeps better if we know where
they got to.
LUV
So long ago... does it matter?
K
She seems to like him.
LUV
Who?
K
The policeman. Deckard. She’s trying to
provoke him. Get a reaction.
LUV
(watching)
It is invigorating being asked personal
questions. Makes one feel -- desired.
(to him, a grin)
Do you enjoy your work, Officer?
K
Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.
LUV
Apologies to have paved a dead end road.
If there’s anything at all else I can do.
GAFF
Deckard liked to work alone. So did I. We
worked together to keep it that way. That
was it.
K
Anything else can you tell me?
28.
GAFF
He wasn’t long for this world.
K
How’s so.
GAFF
Something in the eyes.
K
Do you know how I can contact him?
GAFF
No. He’s retired.
K
What happened?
GAFF
He probably got what he wanted.
K
What’s that?
GAFF
To be alone.
DOXIE #2
Hello hello A-Boy... You alone ?
DOXIE #3
Leave him, he is a fucking Blade
Runner... I’ve seen him. This guy is
dangerous. You coming?
MARIETTE
It’s ok... I’m good.
Buy a lady a cigarette?
You don’t even smile.
K
It only encourages. I’m working.
MARIETTE
You’re drinking.
K
One helps the other. You heard your
friends. You know what I am.
MARIETTE
Yes. A guy eating noodles.
What’s that?
K
A tree.
MARIETTE
A tree? I’ve never seen a tree. It’s
pretty.
K
It’s dead.
MARIETTE
Who keeps a dead tree?
K
Someone dead.
I’m surprised you’re talking to me.
MARIETTE
Why? You’re not going to kill me are
you?
K
Depends. What’s your model number?
MARIETTE
Why don’t you take a look under my eye
and find out...
What’s the matter, don’t like real girls?
K
Who keeps a dead tree?...
LUV
You wanted to review the new model, Sir.
Before shipment. The remote telomerics
implemented, for home renewal.
NIANDER WALLACE (O.S.)
Do you come bearing gifts?
LUV
Not yet, Sir.
NIANDER WALLACE (O.S.)
An Angel should never enter the hut
without a gift. Or news. Can you at
least pronounce a child is born?
The new model. Let us see then.
NIANDER WALLACE
The first thought tends to fear. To
preserve the clay. Fascinating. Before
we even know what we are, we fear to lose
it. Happy birthday.
NIANDER WALLACE
Now let’s have a look at you.
Bring the one for micronics, would you,
luv.
NIANDER WALLACE
We make Angels. In service of
Civilization. There were bad angels
once... I make good angels now. Like
you, luv. God saw a bad batch and, rash
and cranky, scrapped the whole project.
We are not so short sighted. Just
because some fell...
Now look. I brought back the Angels and
took us to nine new worlds.
Nine. A child can count to nine on
fingers. We should own the stars.
LUV
Yes, Sir.
NIANDER WALLACE
We were meant to reach beyond the
firmament. We should read our books by
the light of a thousand different stars.
Every one a home. Till we lose count.
That’s the future of the species if
there’s to be one. We simply need more
Angels to carry us aloft.
LUV
Sir.
NIANDER WALLACE
Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce. We
lost our stomach for slaves. Unless...
engineered. And I can only make so many.
To make this I have to build from whole
cloth. Bit by bit and at great expense.
Shameful inefficiency, built into
Tyrell’s template. Tyrell.
That barren pasture, empty and salted.
Right there. The dead space between the
stars. This the seat that we must change
for Heav’n.
I cannot breed them. I have tried, so
help me. Tyrell’s final puzzle in
adamantine chains and penal Fire.
We need more Replicants than can ever be
assembled. Millions so we can be
trillions. More. Worlds beyond worlds,
diamond shores. We could storm Eden and
retake her...
His last trick. Procreation.
Perfected... then lost. There is a
child. Finally unearthed. Bring it to
me. Bring it to me. Bring it to me.
LUV
Sir.
NIANDER WALLACE
The best Angel of all. Aren’t you, luv?
COCO
Hi. Wait -- you can’t take those.
LUV
Of course not. Proper channels and
paperwork. It’s all here. Hold this for
me?
JOSHI
Your lady friend about?
K
Madam.
JOSHI
Coco is dead. Bones are gone. It’s out.
Already out. How long’d that take?
Someone’s on your tail. A someone
willing to kill. Care to make any
wagers?
K
I could lay odds.
JOSHI
I can feel the breath on my neck. They
are coming after this. They’ve got every
gun in the city if they want it. I’ve
got you... So what do you have for me?
And don’t say nothing.
A sock. Where did you find it?
K
Sapper’s. There was a baby there. Long
enough to wear that.
“Never seen a miracle...”
JOSHI
So what does he do with his miracle?
Anything else?
K
I burned everything else.
JOSHI
What about this? 6/10/21. What’s that?
A birthday? A death day?
K
I don’t know yet.
JOSHI
Maybe it’s only me can see the sunrise
here. This breaks the world, K. You
ever seen scorched earth? It’s glass.
Shreds your feet. Nothing grows.
Are feet ever so small?
I had a kid. Grown up now... Hates me.
JOSHI
I’ve known a lot of your kind. All useful
but... with you I sometimes forget... We
didn’t have any of you where I was a kid.
You don’t remember anything before you
were under me, do you? You have any
memories from before?
K
I have memories. They give us some.
Implants. They’re not real.
JOSHI
Tell me one. From when you were a kid.
K
I feel strange sharing a childhood story
considering I was never a child.
JOSHI
Would it help if I told you it was an
order.
K
I had a toy, this wooden horse. An
inscription underneath. All I remember
is a group of boys, big kids, try and
take it away from me. So I run.
This is dumb -- it’s all fake. I was
never a kid --
JOSHI
Go on. Little K with his tiny toy...
scared of mean boys taking it...
K (V.O.)
I go looking for a hiding place. There’s
nowhere to go but this... dark furnace.
It’s very dark. I’m very scared... But
this horse is all I have so I go in
anyway.
K
That’s it.
JOSHI
Little K, fighting for what’s his.
That’s a good one... No wonder with you
I sometimes forget. Look at me.
(then)
We’re all just looking out for something
real.
What happens if I finish this?
K
Shouldn’t I get back to work, Madam.
JOSHI
You do polite like some folks go
screaming. Check back in after DeNAbase.

You didn’t like her enough to tell her

K
There’s nothing to tell.
JOI
How many times have you told me that
story -- your memory. The date carved
beneath.
Coincidence?
K
A dangerous coincidence.
JOI
I always knew you were special. Maybe
this is how.
A child... of woman born. Pushed into
the world... Wanted... Loved...
K
If it were true, I’d be hunted for the
rest of my life by someone just like me.
JOI
It’s okay to dream a little, isn’t it?
K
Not for us.
There. Hold.

The boy. They faked his print. If they

Watch the car.

MISTER COTTON
I’ll put you outside where it’s raining,
raining fire! You’re in here to work.
If you’re not working I don’t need you!
MISTER COTTON
No child in my care is ever cold, is ever
hungry -- clothes, blankets. Food, not
the tastiest but warm and enough. I
encourage play, keeps them occupied,
makes them nimble. But it’s work that
molds them into a child worth having.
We find new life for everything
discarded. And every one. The nickel
goes to colonial ships. Closest any of
them will get to the grand life offworld.
Now -- what sort did you have in mind? I
have all kinds.
K
I’m not buying.
MISTER COTTON
No. This is my game and I play it fair.
Bigger have tried to shut me down, men at
that.
K
A little boy came through here, 30 years
back. I need to see your records.
Legitimate placements, private sales.
Everything, in and out.
MISTER COTTON
I don’t keep records that far back.
K
You don’t.
MISTER COTTON
I can’t help you.
K
I think you can. I think someone like
you keeps a long memory. Minds what he
owes and makes sure he gets paid.
Someone like you keeps it all careful.
You can tell me what you know... or I put
a hole right here and take a look.
MISTER COTTON
You coming?
MISTER COTTON
It’s gone. The entire year, it should be
here! It-- wasn’t me -- it wasn’t me --
JOI
I always told you. You’re special. Born
not made. Hidden with care. A real boy
now.
K
What’s wrong?
JOI
I’m sorry. I saw you. Dead. The
thought of you. Gone. Hurt me.
You’re special, Jo. I always knew it.
K
Jo?
JOI
You’re too important for “K.” A real boy
needs a real name. Your mother would
have named you. Jo.
Jo... Jo... Jo...
K
How can I tell if a memory’s an implant
or not?
JOI
Who makes the memories?
K
Doctor Ana Stelline?
ANA
A visitor.
K
Is that all right?
ANA
Just unusual.
Even more unusual. Nice to meet you --
(reading)
Officer KD6-3.7
Sorry. Compromised immune system, a life
of freedom so long as it’s behind glass.
K
I was wondering.
ANA
Why I’m not offworld? My parents had our
passes in pocket, then I took sick. It
was a new life or me, they picked me.
Made my cage and filled it with
everything they could to keep me happy --
except company of course, and I was used
to crowds. What can I help you with?
K
Just questions. You might be able to
help me with a case.
ANA
That is the most interesting thing I’ve
been offered to help with in ages. Do
you mind if I work while you talk? I
promise I hear every word.
I loved birthday parties.
K
You make memories, that go into
Replicants. They say you make the best.
ANA
Then they’re kind.
K
You work for Wallace.
ANA
Subcontract. I’m one of his suppliers.
He offered to buy me out, I take my
freedom where I can find it.
K
What makes your memories so... authentic?
ANA
I was locked in an aseptic cloister at
eight. If I wanted to see the world I
had to imagine it. I got very good at
imagining. Wallace needs my talent to
maintain a stable product. “Provide
context for unavoidable affect.” I think
it’s only kind.
Replicants live such hard lives, made to
do what we’d rather not. I can’t help
your future, but I can give you good
memories to think back on and smile. A
birthday party.
K
Nice.
ANA
It’s better than nice. It feel
authentic. If you have authentic
memories, you’ll have real human
responses wouldn’t you agree?
K
Are all the memories constructed or do
you ever use ones that are real?
ANA
It’s illegal to use real memories. But
there’s bit of every artist in their
work.
K
How can you tell the difference? Can you
tell if a memory really happened?
ANA
Untangling memory and history. They all
think it’s about more detail, dutiful
exactitude, hyberbolic photorealism --
that’s not how the memory works. We
recall with our feelings... and our
feelings are awful students. The mind is
an impressionist. Anything real should
be a mess. I can show you.
Sit.
K
Does it hurt?
ANA
Only if you fight it. So maybe don’t
fight it.
Now think about the memory you want me to
see. Not even that hard. Just picture
it. Let it play.
A fake. An ugly fake at that.
K
You can tell that quick.
ANA
Stolen straight off the art book shelf.
Detail without mood. Colors are too
perfect, the moral too clear -- “keep
away from water.” Did it work?
Lazy work.
K
Can we try another?
ANA
No one invented that. It was a real
moment. Remembered.
K
You’re -- certain?
ANA
Someone lived this. This happened.
K
I know it’s real.

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
You’re not even close to baseline.
JOSHI
The hell is with you?
I put you on a case, I impressed on you
the importance of that case. Then we
pick you up fucking around outside some
upgrade center.
Scan said you didn’t look like you inside
-- miles off your baseline. You know
what this means... You should have been
retired right there on your feet.
K
I found the kid.
He was set it up as a standard Replicant,
put on a service job. Hidden in plain
sight. Plainest. They wrote over any
memory, added fake ones, so -- even he
didn’t know what he was. Someone cared
enough to give him a life.
JOSHI
And?
K
It’s done.
JOSHI
What does that mean it’s done?
K
What you asked. It’s done. No trace
left. Just like you wanted.
JOSHI
You just stopped a bomb going off.
You did good. It can’t have been easy.
You’re allowed to be hit by this one.
K
Thank you.
JOSHI
Hell, I’m 55. My twenties are in their
thirties. Plenty of cases broke me, too
many and not half as bad. We all owe you
one, know it or not...
I can help you get you out of this
station alive. You have 48 hours to come
back on track. Your next baseline is out
of my hands.
K
Thank you, Madam.
K
You were right. You were right bout
everything.
JOI
Shhhh, I know. I have something special
for you. You deserve more than me. I
can’t even touch you.
K
I feel you plenty.
JOI
Silly trick. Haptic static. You’re
special, like I always knew. I want to
be real for you.
K
You’re more real to me than any of them.
JOI
You love me so you only see what’s good
in me. You see my faults as freckles.
K
You don’t have any freckles.
I like ’em.
MARIETTE
Thought you weren’t interested. Worky
man.
JOI
You liked her, I could tell. It’s okay.
She’s real... I want to be real for you.
K
You are real for me.
MARIETTE
You have a special lady here.
Look at you.
JOI
Quiet now. I have to sync.
MARIETTE
From a tree...
JOI
I’m done with you. You can go.
MARIETTE
“Quiet now.” I’ve been inside you. Not
so much there as you think.
K
From a tree...
JOI
Your story isn’t over yet.
There’s still a page left. Written with
love.
K
They’ll be coming soon. You’re coming
with me.
JOI
No.
Not like this. If they come here looking
for you they’ll have access to all my
memories. You have to delete me from the
console.
My present. Put me there.
None of the rest can touch me. I can be
me with you. Only. Always.
K
I can’t. It’s just a weak processor.
JOI
A body.
K
If anything happened to it, that’s it...
you’d be gone.
JOI
Yes. Like a real girl.
Please. I want this. I can’t do it
myself.
JOI (V.O.)
Take me off the console.
Do it.
DOC BADGER
Real wood. You are rich, my friend. You
could buy a real horse with this. You
want a real horse?
K
I don’t want a real horse.
DOC BADGER
I can get you one. Like Wallace shit.
Amazing!
K
Can you tell where it’s from?
DOC BADGER
Smells like dirt. Old dirt. But the
structure is changed. Old dirt, new
change...
K
Radiation. From a reactor?
DOC BADGER
No. More volatile.
K
Matches a dirty bomb.
DOC BADGER
There is only one place that dirty.
Radioactivity that strong.
K
But no ones lives there...
DOC BADGER
You ask me where it came from, now I tell
you. So, what else do you want, my
friend? A horse? A sheep? Off-world
papers! Whatever you want, Doc Badger
can get!
K (O.S.)
Pull back 200 meters. Hold.
Move in right, 15 degrees. More. More.
Stop. Back 20 meters. Go to 5. 6. 7.
K
Heat analysis.
Life.
JOI
What is it?
K
We’ll find out.
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
“You mightn’t happen to have a piece of
cheese about you now, boy?”
K
“Treasure Island?”
DECKARD
He reads. That’s good. Me too. Not
much else to do around here at night
anymore. “Many’s the night I’ve dreamed
of cheese -- toasted, mostly.”
What are you doing here?
K
I heard the piano.
DECKARD
Don’t lie. It’s rude.
You’re a cop.
K
I’m not trying to bring you in...
DECKARD
Oh yeah. Then what?
K
I -- have questions.
DECKARD
Is that all?
K
That’s it.
DECKARD
Ok. What questions?
DECKARD
Wait here.
K
I don’t want to hurt you.
DECKARD
Okay.
I like this song.
We can keep at it. Or we can get a
drink.
K
I’d take a drink.
DECKARD
Good answer.
LUV
Too dark in here.
Your pet. I liked him. He’s a good boy.
Where is he?
JOSHI
So you’re who’s looking.
No idea. He’s off duty, reward for a job
well done. Check around.
LUV
I checked. Anywhere a good boy might go.
JOSHI
You’re too late. It’s gone. He
destroyed it. Everything about it.
Except a box of bones you already took.
Which I’ll wager wasn’t enough. Here you
are.
LUV
You tiny thing. In the face of the
fabulous new your only thought is to kill
it. For fear of great change. You
can’t hold the tide with a broom.
JOSHI
Except that I did.
LUV
Where is he?
You’re so sure. Because he told you.
Because we never lie? I’m going to tell
Mister Wallace you tried to shoot me
first. That’s why I had to kill you.
JOSHI
You do what you got.
LUV
“Madam.”
Location Officer K D6-3.7.
K
Nice place you got.
DECKARD
It’s okay. See that? Know how much
that’s worth?
Nothing. Whole town was something, one
time. Forget your troubles, see a show.
Gamble a little, win some money, lose
some money. They even make money look
like candy. One little dirty bomb spoils
everything. Do you like whiskey? I have
a million bottles of whiskey.
K
Is it real?
DECKARD
I don’t know. Ask him.
Got a name.
K
Officer KD6-
DECKARD
That’s not a name. That’s a serial
number.
K
Ok. Jo.
DECKARD
What do you want, Jo?
K
I want to ask you some questions.
DECKARD
Like what?
K
What was her name?
DECKARD
Who?
K
The mother of your child. What was she
like? Did you live here together?
DECKARD
Too many questions. I had your job once.
Was good at it. Point and shoot. Paint
by number.
K
It was simpler then.
DECKARD
Why make it complicated?
K
Why don’t you answer the question?
DECKARD
What question?
K
Didn’t figure you as one for bullshit --
what’s her name?
DECKARD
Rachael. Her name was Rachael.
K
What happened to the kid? Did you take
it to the orphanage?
85.
DECKARD
I was long gone by then. There’s always
someone come looking. They’d never stop.
Anything I knew’d just light a path.
K
You didn’t even meet your own kid. Why?
DECKARD
Because that was the plan. I showed them
how to scramble the records, cover their
tracks. Everyone had a part. Mine was
to leave. Then came the Blackout and
paved over everything. I couldn’t have
found the child if I tried.
K
Did you want to?
DECKARD
Not really.
K
Why not?
DECKARD
Because I didn’t want our child found,
taken apart, dissected.
Sometimes to love someone you’ve got to
be a stranger.
K
To strangers.
LUV
No. Hold.
Certain.
Quite.
DECKARD
Who’d you bring?
K
No one.
DECKARD
They know you’re here.
K
I came alone. No one’s following.
DECKARD
There’s always someone come.
LUV
Now.
LUV
Bad dog.
JOI (O.S.)
Stop!
LUV
I do hope you’re satisfied with our
product.
JOI
I love y--
LUV
Bad.
MARIETTE
I sewed you some. If you need to die,
this is a good place for it.
NIANDER WALLACE (O.S.)
Always jumping that one, never a thought
what to do if he made land. All the
courage in the world cannot alter fact.
I have wanted to meet you for so long.
The Barracuda revolves around Deckard, taking him in.
You are a window to me, Mister Deckard.
Where you’ve been. All you are.
I learn something new from everyone. Do
you want to know what I learned from you?
It is possible to be very clever without
even being smart.
I had the lock. I found the key. Yet
the pins do not align. The door remains
locked. The answer to every problem just
within. I need the specimen to reach it,
Mister Deckard. The child. I need the
child.
Lock and key... You and she... My
Archangel. To teach them all to fly.
“And God remembered Rachael. And heeded
her. And opened her womb.”
Is it the same, now, as then? The moment
you met her. All these years you looked
back on that day, drunk on the memory of
its perfection... how shiny her lips...
how instant your connection.
Did it never occur to you that was why
you were summoned in the first place?
Designed to do nothing short of fall for
her right then and there. All to make
that single perfect... specimen.
That is, if you were designed. Love...
or mathematical precision... Yes?...
No?... You are a window to me.
DECKARD
I know what’s real.
NIANDER WALLACE
Very clever to keep yourself empty of
information. And all it cost you was
everything. But. You can still help me.
I can see -- deliberate spaces in your
mind, engrammic lacunae, faces blocked.
You had help in the hiding. Where did
they go? You know something. Help me...
and good things can come to you.
DECKARD
You don’t have children, do you?
NIANDER WALLACE
I have millions.
You think I’ve nothing to offer but pain.
Only you love pain. Pain reminds you the
joy you felt was real. Good. Yes. More
joy then.
Do not be afraid.
An Angel. Made again. For you.
RACHAEL
Did you miss me?
Don’t you love me?
DECKARD
Her eyes were green.
NIANDER WALLACE
Offworld I have everything I need to make
you talk. You don’t know what pain is
yet. You will learn.
FREYSA
You must want I look up and to the left.
Runners heeling me a long time for this.
Make a fine bit of bonus, would my eye,
would it weren’t a long long gone.
K
I know you.
MARIETTE
This is Freysa. She fought with Sapper
on Calantha.
K
You were there. At Sapper’s farm. You
helped them hide the child.
FREYSA
Ohhhh, I was there. I saw a miracle
delivered. Held a pinchy perfect face
crying up at me, mad as thunder.
I knew, it all changes now. The first
drop of rain. Something to die for...
K
Where you with her? Rachael. When the
baby came.
FREYSA
I saw baby come. I held Mama as she die.
She die good. She die feeling it. Daddy
already flew gone before he could see,
leaving a puzzle behind. We each hide a
piece so no one mind ever know enough to
make the map. Daddy least of all. Why
Sapper let you kill him, keep his piece.
(off K, enthralled)
Deckard wanted it keep quiet. I fail him
on that. Told anyone with ears to hear.
Of a baby come from one of us. Some
listen too.

That baby meant we was more than
creations. We was creation. More than
just slaves. If a baby can come from one
of us... we are our own masters.
MARIETTE
“More human than humans.”
K
What about Deckard? They’ll kill him.
FREYSA
He don’t matter.
Deckard, Sapper... me, you... our lives
nothing next to a storm coming.
Some listen too. Here we are. An army
now.
Go on. I not so afraid to die. Done
right, dying the most human thing we do.
K
I found Deckard. I led Wallace to him.
FREYSA
Don’t pay no mind on that. He always
wanted to die for his own. Never had the
luck. Officer did him a favor.
Deckard only want his baby stay safe.
And she will. I wish I could find her...
I show her unto the world. And she lead
an army!
K
She?
FREYSA
Course. Rachael have a daughter. A baby
girl.
With my own eye. I see her come, I dress
her in blue when time she go.
K
No. A girl died. It was a boy you hid.
FREYSA
Just a piece a puzzle.
ANA
No one invented that. It was a real
moment. Someone lived this.
DECKARD (V.O.)
I showed them how to scramble the
records, cover their tracks.
There is a bit of every artist in their
work...
FREYSA
You imagine it was you? Ohhhh... You
did, you did. We all wish it was us.
That’s why we believe.
“JOI”
Hello, Handsome. What a day, hmmm?
You look lonely. I can fix that.
Aww...
You look like a good Joe.
DECKARD
Where are we going?
LUV
Home.
Take us back.
LUV
Get us up.
LUV
I’m the best one.
LUV
Offworld is waiting.
DECKARD
Jo!
DECKARD
You should’ve let me die.
K
You did. You drowned in the ocean.
You’re free. Free to meet your daughter.
DECKARD
Daughter...?
K
All the best memories... are hers...
Deckard stares at him from a place beyond gratitude.
106.
DECKARD
Why? What am I to you?
K
Go meet her.
JOI (V.O.)
Would you read to me.
K (V.O.)
“And blood-black nothingness began to...
spin... a system of cells interlinked...
K (V.O.)

ANA
Just a moment. Beautiful, isn’t it.
