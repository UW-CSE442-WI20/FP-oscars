MILDRED
You Red Welby?
RED
Yes, ma’am. How may I...?
MILDRED
They said those three billboards out on
Drinkwater Road, you’re in charge of
renting them out, that right?
RED
I didn’t know we had any billboards out
on... Where is Drinkwater Road?
MILDRED
Road out past the Sizemore turn-off noone uses since the highway got put in.
RED
You’re right. Got three billboards out
there. Nobody’s put nothing up out
there since... 1986. That was
‘Huggies’.
MILDRED
How much to rent out all three of ‘em
the year?
RED
The year? You wanna pay for three
billboards on a road no-one goes down
unless they got lost or they’re
retards, for a year?
MILDRED
Quick, ain’t ya, Welby?
RED
Well... since what I say goes these
days down at the Ebbing Advertising
Desk, I’m gonna strike you a real good
deal on those billboards, now, what was
it you said your name was, Mrs...?
MILDRED
What’s the law on what ya can and can’t
say on a billboard? I assume it’s ya
can’t say nothing defamatory, and ya
can’t say, ‘Fuck’ ‘Piss’ or ‘Cunt’.
That right?
RED
Or... Anus.
MILDRED
Well I think I’ll be alright then.
Here’s five thousand for the first
month. I assume that’ll cover it.
And here’s what the billboards oughta
say.
Why don’t ya draw up a little contract
betwixt us while you’re at it, make
sure no-one rents them billboards out
from under me?
RED
I guess you’re Angela Hayes’ mother.
MILDRED
That’s right, I’m Angela Hayes’ mother.
Name’s Mildred. How long before you’ve
got ‘em put up?
RED
Oh, shall we say by... Easter Sunday?
MILDRED
That’d be perfect.
DIXON
Hey! What the Hell’s this?!
LATINO
Que?
DIXON
“How come Chief Willoughby?” what?
LATINO
What?
DIXON
Yeah!
LATINO
Huh?
DIXON
How come what?
LATINO
What?!
DIXON
Listen, I better start getting some
straight answers outta you Mexican sons
of bitches...
What the Hell is this?
Hey you? What the fuck is this?
JEROME
What the fuck is what?
DIXON
This! This!
JEROME
Advertising, I guess.
DIXON
Advertising what?
JEROME
Something obscure?
DIXON
I’ll say!
JEROME
Don’t I know your face from some place?
DIXON
I dunno, do ya?
JEROME
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
DIXON
I could arrest you right now, if I
wanted to.
JEROME
For what?
DIXON
For... emptying out your bucket there.
It’s against the... being bad against
the environment laws.
JEROME
Well, before you do that, Officer
Dixon, why don’t you go have yourself a
look at that first billboard over
there, and then we can have ourself a
talk about the motherfucking
environment. How about that?
DIXON
Fuck me.
ANNE
Don’t...
WILLOUGHBY
Dixon, you goddam asshole, I’m in the
middle of my goddam Easter dinner...
DIXON
I know, Chief, and I’m sorry for
calling ya at home and all, but uh, I
think we’ve got kind of a problem...
MILDRED
Sorry I’m late, Denise.
DENISE
Did you put up those billboards to fuck
with the cops yet?
MILDRED
They’re up.
DENISE
You go, girl! You go fuck those cops
up!
SERGEANT
What the fuck do you think you’re
doing, Welby, buncha billboards like
that, you didn’t think there’d be some
kinda ramifications? Legally?
RED
What’s the legal ramifications, Cedric?
SERGEANT
You want me to explain the legal
ramifications, a little punk like you?
And don’t call me Cedric.
RED
Ain’t contravening no laws on
propriety, ain’t contravening no laws
on any fucking thing. I checked all
this up.
SERGEANT
Oh yeah, where’d you check all this up?
RED
In a... book.
SERGEANT
Which book, genius?
RED
Book called ‘Suck my ass, it’s none o’
your business’.
WILLOUGHBY
How long has this person, or persons,
rented these billboards out for?
RED
Oh, the year.
WILLOUGHBY
And how long she actually paid for?
RED
The year.
WILLOUGHBY
So it’s a she, huh?
RED
Ain’t at liberty to divulge that kinda
information, Chief.
WILLOUGHBY
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?
RED
Ain’t at liberty to divulge that kinda
information, Chief.
WILLOUGHBY
Do you really wanna fuck with the
Ebbing Police Department, Red? Do ya?
RED
I guess.
DIXON
He said what?! To your face?!
SERGEANT
No crime has been committed here.
DIXON
Defamation of character ain’t a crime?
SERGEANT
It isn’t defamation if she’s simply
asking a question.
DIXON
What are you, an idiot?
SERGEANT
Don’t call me an idiot, Dixon.
DIXON
I didn’t call you an idiot. I asked if
you was an idiot. It was a question.
WILLOUGHBY
He got ya, Cedric!
DIXON
Well I’m gonna do something about it if
yous two ain’t.
WILLOUGHBY
Where you going? Don’t fly off the
handle!
SERGEANT
Why in hell you keep that man on, Bill?
WILLOUGHBY
He’s a good man. At heart.
SERGEANT
He tortured a guy in custody, Bill.
WILLOUGHBY
There was no... real evidence to
support that.
DIXON
Take ‘em down.
RED
Hah?
DIXON
Take ‘em down.
RED
Take what down?
DIXON
You think I wouldn’t take you out,
right here on Main Street, Red?
RED
Thought you only take out black dudes,
Dixon...
DIXON
Ain’t nobody never goes down that road,
anyways. Unless they got lost, or
they’re retards.
GABRIELLA
This your first time on tv?
MILDRED
Uh-huh.
GABRIELLA
Well, don’t be nervous, is the main
thing, and it’ll be fine. Just don’t
look into the camera, obviously.
In three, two, one. So, Mildred Hayes,
why did you put up these billboards?
MILDRED
Well, my daughter, Angela, she got
abducted, and she got raped and murdered
seven months ago, on this self-same
stretch o’ road here, unfortunately,
and, to me... I mean, to me, it seems
like the local police department is too
busy goin’ round torturing black folks
to be bothered doing anything about
solving actual crime, so I kinda thought
these here billboards might, y’know,
concentrate their minds some.
DIXON
Whatcha watching, Momma? The stupid
news?
MILDRED 
Seems like the local police department
is too busy goin’ round torturing black
folks to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime...
DIXON
Fuck.
MILDRED 
I don’t know what these policemen are
doing, to be honest with you. I just
know my daughter’s burnt body’s lying
six feet under the ground while they’re
eating Krispy Kremes and busting eight
year-olds for skateboarding in parking
lots.
GABRIELLA 
And what has Chief Willoughby to do
with all this, why single him out?
MILDRED 
Well, he’s the head of ‘em, ain’t he?
The buck’s gotta stop at somebody,
don’t it?
GABRIELLA 
And the buck stops at Willoughby?
MILDRED 
Yeah, the buck stops at Willoughby.
Dead right it does.
ANNE
You alright there, fella?
WILLOUGHBY
Looks like we got a war on our hands.
Can we talk?
I’d do anything to catch the guy who
did it, Mrs Hayes. But when the DNA
don’t match no-one who’s ever been
arrested, and when the DNA don’t match
any other crime nationwide, and when
there wasn’t a single eyewitness from
the time she left your house to the
time we found her, well, right now
there ain’t too much more that we can
do, except...
MILDRED
Could pull blood from every man and boy
in this town, over the age of eight.
WILLOUGHBY
There’s civil rights laws prevents
that, Mrs Hayes, and what if he was
just passing thru town...
MILDRED
Pull blood from ever’ man in the
country, then.
WILLOUGHBY
And what if he was just passing thru
the country?
MILDRED
If it was me, I’d start up a database,
every male baby what’s born, stick ‘em
on it, cross-reference it, and as soon
as they done something wrong, make a
hundred percent certain it was a
correct match, then kill ‘em.
WILLOUGHBY
Yeah, well, there’s definitely civil
rights laws prevents that.
He sits on the swing beside her, the billboards stretching
out down the hill in front of them.
I’m doing everything I can to track him
down, Mrs Hayes. I don’t think those
billboards is very fair.
MILDRED
The time it’s took you to come out here
whining like a bitch, Willoughby, some
other poor girl’s probably being
butchered right now, but it’s good
you’ve got your priorities straight,
I’ll say that for ya.
WILLOUGHBY
There’s something else, Mildred.
I got cancer. I’m dying.
MILDRED
I know it.
WILLOUGHBY
Huh?
MILDRED
I know it. Most everbody in town knows
it.
WILLOUGHBY
You know it, and you still put those
billboards up?
MILDRED
Well, they wouldn’t be as effective
after you croak, right?
DIXON
Well looky looky, if it ain’t the
instigator of this whole goddam affair
in the first place...
RED
I didn’t instigate shit, Dixon...
DIXON
Playing pool against the town midget.
JAMES
He’s right, Red, you are playing pool
against the town midget.
RED
Well he’s a cop, y’know, he’s
observant.
DIXON
You know, I always disliked you, Red,
ever since you was a snotty little
child, which you still look like. A
snotty little child.
RED
Well that’s unfortunate. I always
thought you was great.
DIXON
Even your name, ‘Red Welby’. Even your
name I disliked.
RED
Well... okay.
DIXON
Like you was some kind of a goddam
Communist or something, and proud of it.
RED
No, it’s cos I got red hair.
DIXON
Do you know what they do to faggots
down in Cuba, Welby?
RED
Wow, that’s left-field... No, what do
they do to faggots down in Cuba, Dixon?
DIXON
They kill ‘em! Which, it might surprise
you to learn, I am against.
RED
I’m not sure if they do kill faggots
down in Cuba, Dixon. I know Cuba’s
human rights record is pretty
deplorable when it comes to
homosexuality, but killing ‘em? Are you
sure you ain’t thinking of Wyoming?
DIXON
Always with the smart-ass...
Jesus! He’s quite good, isn’t he?
Willoughby’s a good man, Red. He
shouldn’t have this be the only thing
he thinks about, the last months left
to him.
RED
The last months what?
DIXON
Oh. You didn’t know. Yeah. Pancreatic.
MILDRED
I’m up next if any of you ole ladies
ever quit yakking.
DIXON
Rude.
JAMES
Saw you on TV the other day, Mildred.
MILDRED
Oh yeah?
JAMES
Yeah, you looked good.
I mean, y’know, you came across really
good, in the things you were saying.
DIXON
I didn’t think you came across really
good in the things you were saying. I
thought you came across stupid-ass.
MILDRED
Ain’t it about time you got home to
your momma, Dixon?
DIXON
No it ain’t time I got home to my
momma. I tole her I was gonna be out
til twelve. Actually.
Jesus!
JAMES
Me v. you, Mildred!
MILDRED
Hey Robbie? I think that midget wants
to get in my pants...
Father Montgomery.
MONTGOMERY
Mildred. I’m sorry for calling on you
so late, although I must say Robbie’s
been the consummate host. Despite his
having, he was just telling me,
something of a tricky day at school.
ROBBIE
Oh, no, just some of the guys on the
team was giving me crap.
MILDRED
Crap about what?
MONTGOMERY
About the billboards. Which is, uh,
kind of what I’ve come to have a word
with you about, Mildred.
MILDRED
Oh. Proceed.
MONTGOMERY
I know it’s been hard for you, Mildred,
this past year. We all do. The whole
town does. And whatever it is you need,
we’ll be there for you. Always. But the
town also knows what kind of a man
William Willoughby is. And the town is
dead set against these billboards of
yours.
MILDRED
Took a poll, did ya, Father?
MONTGOMERY
If you hadn’t stopped coming to church,
Mildred, you’d be aware of the depth of
people’s feelings. I had a dozen people
come up to me on Sunday. So, yes, I
took a poll. Everybody is on your side
about Angela. No-one’s on your side
about this.
MILDRED
Y’know what I was thinking about,
earlier today? I was thinking ‘bout
those streetgangs they got in Los
Angeles, the Crips and the Bloods? I
was thinking about that buncha new laws
they came up with, in the 80’s I think
it was, to combat those street-gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.
And, if I remember rightly, the gist of
what those new laws said was, if you
join one of these gangs, and you’re
running with ‘em, and down the block
from you one night, unbeknownst to you,
your fellow Crips, or your fellow
Bloods, shoot up a place, or stab a
guy, well, even though you didn’t know
nothing about it, even though you
may’ve just been standing on a
streetcorner minding your own business,
those new laws said you are still
culpable. You are still culpable, by
the very act of joining those Crips, or
those Bloods, in the first place. Which
got me thinking, Father, that whole
type of situation is kinda similar to
you Church boys, ain’t it? You’ve got
your colors, you’ve got your clubhouse,
you’re, for want of a better word, a
gang. And if you’re upstairs smoking a
pipe and reading a bible while one of
your fellow gang members is downstairs
fucking an altar boy then, Father, just
like the Crips, and just like the
Bloods, you’re culpable. Cos you joined
the gang, man. And I don’t care if you
never did shit or never saw shit or
never heard shit. You joined the gang.
You’re culpable. And when a person is
culpable to altar-boy-fucking, or anykinda-boy-fucking, I know you guys
didn’t really narrow it down, then they
kinda forfeit the right to come into my
house and say a word about me, or my
life, or my daughter, or my billboards.
So, why don’t you just finish your tea
there, Father, and get the fuck outta
my kitchen.
ROBBIE
But thanks for coming up anyway,
Father.
DOCTOR
How you been feeling, Bill?
WILLOUGHBY
Oh, like I got cancer in a major organ.
DOCTOR
Well I just want you to know, we’re all
on your side about this Mildred Hayes
thing...
WILLOUGHBY
If I have to hear that one more fucking
time...!
I’m done with this shit. I can’t waste
my life waiting.
WILLOUGHBY
Get me the file on the Hayes case.
DIXON
The Angela Hayes case or the Mildred
Hayes case?
WILLOUGHBY
There is no Mildred Hayes case.
DIXON
We’ve had two official complaints about
the billboards, so, actually...
WILLOUGHBY
From who?
DIXON
A lady with a funny eye... and a fat dentist.
WILLOUGHBY
Get me the file on the Angela Hayes
case. “A lady with a funny fucking
eye”, Jesus Christ.
WILLOUGHBY
Late night?
DIXON
No.
WILLOUGHBY
Lay off that Welby guy.
DIXON
Or you’ll do what?
WILLOUGHBY
Or I’ll kick your Momma’s teeth in.
DIXON
No you won’t.
Who told ya I was laying on him anyway?
The midget?
WILLOUGHBY
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Fucking midgets! I’m trying to fucking
concentrate!
DIXON
What are you looking for, anyway?
There’s nothing to look for.
MILDRED
I don’t know what it is. The filling
feels like it’s kinda waggling.
GEOFFREY
Well if it’s waggling it’s gonna haveta
come out.
MILDRED
Ain’t you gonna have a look at it
first?
GEOFFREY
It’s gonna haveta come out.
MILDRED
Uh, can I get a little Novocaine,
there, Doc?
GEOFFREY
Give it a couple minutes.
MILDRED
Maybe it wasn’t waggling. Maybe it was
just my fingers going in and out.
GEOFFREY
I just wanted to say... There’s a lotta
good friends of Bill Willoughby in this
town, Mrs Hayes, who don’t take kindly
to...
MILDRED
Then why don’t you tell those good
friends of Bill Willoughby to tell Bill
Willoughby to go do his fucking job,
fat boy.
WILLOUGHBY
Hey there, Mildred! You didn’t happen
to pay a visit to the dentist today,
did ya?
MILDRED
No.
WILLOUGHBY
Huh?
MILDRED
Said ‘No’.
WILLOUGHBY
Oh. So it wasn’t you who drilled a
little hole in one of big fat
Geoffrey’s big fat thumbnails, no?
MILDRED
Of course not.
WILLOUGHBY
Huh?
MILDRED
I said “Of course not.”
DENISE
You drilled a hole in the dentist?
MILDRED
No, Denise, I didn’t.
DENISE
Huh?
WILLOUGHBY
Well, I thought it was kinda funny
myself, but he wants to press charges,
so we’re gonna have to bring you in,
I’m afraid.
MILDRED
So how’s it all going in the niggertorturing business, Dixon?
DIXON
It’s ‘Persons of color’-torturing
business, these days, if you want to
know. And I didn’t torture nobody.
She idles back to the table and sits.
Goddam saying that goddam stuff on TV.
My momma watches that station!
MILDRED
And she didn’t know nothing about the
torturing?
DIXON
No she didn’t know anything about it.
She’s against that kinda thing.
WILLOUGHBY
Who’s against what kinda thing?
DIXON
My momma. Is against ‘Persons-of-color
torturing’. She said ‘nigger-torturing’.
I said you can’t say ‘nigger-torturing’
no more. You gotta say ‘Persons-of-color’
torturing. Right?
WILLOUGHBY
I think I’ll be able to take care of
Mrs Hayes on my own from hereon, Jason.
DIXON
Sure, Chief, I’ll be right outside if
you need me.
WILLOUGHBY
Don’t gimme that look. If you got rid
of every cop with vaguely racist
leanings then you’d have three cops
left and all o’ them are gonna hate the
fags so what are ya gonna do, y’know?
I wanna know something, Mildred...
MILDRED
Does sitting up high like that make you
feel more powerful, Chief?
WILLOUGHBY
I’m sorry, Mildred, I’ll go sit where I was
if it makes you feel more comfortable.
MILDRED
I didn’t say I was uncomfortable. I
don’t get uncomfortable around cops.
Sit wherever you want. It’s your police
station.
WILLOUGHBY
Why’d ya drill a hole thru poor fat
Geoffrey’s thumbnail?
MILDRED
Oh, that didn’t happen. His hand
slipped and he drilled a hole thru his
self. Is he saying I done it? Jeez,
then I guess it’s just his word against
mine, huh? Kinda like in all those rape
cases you hear about. Except, in this
instance, the chick ain’t losing.
WILLOUGHBY
It ain’t really about winning or
losing, though, is it, Mildred? I mean,
do you think I care about who wins or
loses between the two of yous? Do you
think I care about dentists? I don’t
care about dentists. Nobody cares about
dentists! I do care about, or I’m
interested in, tying you up in court so
long that your hours at the gift shop
are so shot to shit that you ain’t got
a penny to pay for another months
billboards. I’m interested in that.
MILDRED
I got some dough put away...
WILLOUGHBY
What I heard was you had to sell off
your ex-husband’s tractor-trailer to
even pay for this month’s billboards,
that right?
How is ole Charlie, by the way? He
still shacked up with that pretty
little intern works down at the zoo?
MILDRED
He’s still shacked up with some chick
who smells of shit. I don’t know if the
zoo’s got anything to do with it.
Although I’d hope so.
WILLOUGHBY
How old is she? Nineteen? That must
smart.
MILDRED
Keep trying, Officer. Keep trying.
WILLOUGHBY
What’s Charlie think about these here
billboards of yours, an ex-cop like
Charlie?
MILDRED
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater. Same
difference, I guess, right?
WILLOUGHBY
His word against yours, though, right?
Charlie don’t know about them, does he?
MILDRED
It’s none of his business.
WILLOUGHBY
He’s kinda paying for ‘em though, ain’t
he?
MILDRED
I’m paying for ‘em.
WILLOUGHBY
This month you are. How about when...
I didn’t mean to...
MILDRED
I know...
WILLOUGHBY
It was an accident...
MILDRED
I know, baby.
WILLOUGHBY
It’s blood.
MILDRED
I know.
I’ll go get somebody...
WILLOUGHBY
Just let her go.
Just let her go!
LADY
Take those goddam things down!
GEOFFREY
Take ‘em down.
LADY
Or we will!
MILDRED
Any of you funny-eyed fuckers even
think about touching those billboards,
you will fucking die. You got that? You
will fucking die.
JEROME
Yeah, leave her alone. Those billboards
are cool!
ROBBIE
Do birds get cancer?
MILDRED
Huh?
ROBBIE
Birds. Do they get cancer?
MILDRED
I don’t know. Dogs do.
ROBBIE
Yeah, well, I wasn’t talking about
dogs, was I?
Great, the good ole “Raped While Dying”
route home.
Cos if there was two seconds in a day
when I didn’t think about her, and
wasn’t thinking about how she died,
“There ya go, Robbie, think about it
some more, why don’t ya?” It’s good,
too, that as much as a person might’ve
tried to avoid the details of what
happened, cos he didn’t think it’d do
any good, and he didn’t think he could
bear it, it’s also good to be informed
in twenty foot high lettering, and a
real nice font, the precise details of
her last moments, y’know? That it
wasn’t enough that she was raped, and
it wasn’t enough that she died, no.
“Raped While Dying”. Thank you, mom.
MILDRED
I gave you the police reports...
ROBBIE
I didn’t read ‘em! I’m depressed enough
as it fucking is!
ANGELA 
Mom?
MILDRED 
Yeah?
ANGELA
You ain’t going out again tonight, are
ya?
MILDRED
Denise said we might get us a coupla
drinks later, yeah.
ANGELA
Denise gonna be driving ya?
MILDRED
Angela, why don’t you just ask me if
you can borrow the car?
ANGELA
Can I borrow the car?
MILDRED
No.
ANGELA
Bitch!
MILDRED
But I’ll give you money for a taxi if
you ask me nice and don’t call me a
bitch.
ANGELA
Why did you make me ask you borrow it
if you was never gonna let me borrow
it?
MILDRED
Cos it was funny. And cos you’ve been
smoking pot all day.
ANGELA
You are such a hypocrite!
MILDRED
‘Hypocrite,’ how?
ANGELA
You drove drunk with us in the car when
we was kids.
MILDRED
What are you talking about?
ANGELA
Daddy told me.
MILDRED
When did you see him?
ANGELA
I see him all the time, don’t change
the subject. Did you or did you not
drive drunk with us in the car when we
was kids?
MILDRED
Once, maybe...
ANGELA
Oh, ‘once,’ okay...
MILDRED
...when he was in the middle of beating
the shit out of me...
ANGELA
Which we’ve only got your word about,
right?
ROBBIE
For Christ’s sake, Angela...
ANGELA
Oh why are you never on my side,
Robbie?
ROBBIE
I’m always on your side when you’re not
being a cunt.
ANGELA
Hey!
MILDRED
Hey..! There’ll be no more ‘Cunts’ in
this house, you got that, Mister?
ROBBIE
What, are you moving out?
It was a gag!
ANGELA
So are ya gonna let me borrow the car
or what?
MILDRED
Why don’t you just walk, Angela? Why
don’t you just walk?
ANGELA
You know what, I will walk, I will
walk. And y’know what? I hope I get
raped on the way.
MILDRED
Yeah? Well I hope you get raped on the
way too!
DOCTOR
We’re gonna need to keep you in a few
days, Bill. You shouldn’t be coughing
up blood.
WILLOUGHBY
Yeah, I kinda guessed that, Doc.
DOCTOR
I’ll swing by in the morning. Anne.
ANNE
Guess I’ll go get your coat, huh?
WILLOUGHBY
Well you know I ain’t staying...
ANNE
And you know I ain’t arguing.
MILDRED
Slipped. Oops.
ROBBIE
You... old... cunt.
MILDRED
I ain’t old, Robbie..
ROBBIE
That’s dad.
ROBBIE
Hey dad! How you doing?
CHARLIE
Where’s the crazy lady...?
The kid’s got Rice fucking Krispies in
his fucking hair! What’s going on
around here? And what the fuck’s going
on with these fucking billboards,
Mildred?
MILDRED
Kinda self-explanatory, ain’t it?
CHARLIE
Well why don’t you just explain it to
me?
MILDRED
Guess it ain’t self-explanatory then.
Well, y’know, I guess I wanted certain
people’s minds kept on certain people’s
jobs, is all. I hadn’t heard a word
from ‘em in seven goddam months, but I
tell ya this, I heard an awful lot from
‘em since I put those billboards up...
CHARLIE
You think this has focussed their
minds? I’ll tell you what it’s focussed
their minds on. It’s focussed their
minds on how exactly are they gonna
fuck you up.
MILDRED
The more you keep a case in the public
eye, the better your chances of getting
it solved, it’s in all the guidebooks,
Charlie.
CHARLIE
How much those billboards cost?
MILDRED
‘Bout the same as a tractor-trailer.
CHARLIE
What the fuck are you laughing at?
ROBBIE
Nothing.
CHARLIE
Laughed at by a guy with fucking cereal
in his hair!
ROBBIE
How’s Penelope?
CHARLIE
Huh? She’s alright.
ROBBIE
Why don’t you invite her in, save
leaving her sitting there?
MILDRED
She’s here?
CHARLIE
She’s out in the car.
MILDRED
Oh. That explains it.
CHARLIE
That explains what?
MILDRED
I knew I could smell something.
ROBBIE
Let her go.
PENELOPE
Oh, um, I kinda needed to use the
bathroom, but if it’s inconvenient,
actually it is inconvenient, isn’t it,
I can see it’s inconvenient, I can hold
it, it’s alright...
ROBBIE
It’s the first door, down the hall.
PENELOPE
Are you sure? I feel like I’m
intruding...
CHARLIE
Just go pee!
Since when did you grow a pair of
balls?
ROBBIE
‘Bout seven months ago.
MILDRED
Look, you’ve said what you came to say.
Okay? Why don’t ya just go get zoo girl
and get the hell out of my house?
Alright?
PENELOPE
Um, actually, zoo-wise, they were
letting people go at the zoo,
unfortunately, and it was a case of
“Last in, first out”, so, yeah,
unfortunately the zoo had to let me go.
But they were looking for people down
at the horse-rides for the disableds,
to look after the horses down there, so
I’m working down there now, looking
after the disableds horses, so...
The horses aren’t disableds. The
disableds are.
I like all animals.
CHARLIE
Don’t say a word.
MILDRED
I wasn’t gonna say a word.
CHARLIE
Don’t you think I don’t wish it had
never happened?! Don’t you think I
don’t wish she was here still?!
MILDRED
I know you do. I know you do.
CHARLIE
Billboards ain’t gonna bring her back,
Mildred.
MILDRED
Neither is fucking nineteen year olds,
Charlie.
CHARLIE
Yeah. But I know that.
MILDRED
Just go.
CHARLIE
Yeah, alright, I’m such a shitty dad
and you’re such a great mom. Alright.
So how come a week before she died she
comes around asking if she can move in
with me at my place, cos she couldn’t
stand the two of yous bitching at each
other no more, and fighting with each
other no more...
MILDRED
I don’t believe you...
CHARLIE
And I said “No, stay at home, your mom
loves you.” And now I wish I hadn’t,
cos if I hadn’t she’d still fucking be
here!
MILDRED
I don’t believe you!
CHARLIE
Don’t believe me. Ask Fruit Loop boy.
MILDRED
Is it true?
ROBBIE
I don’t know, mom.
MILDRED
Yeah, you do.
DIXON
Oh not Donald Sutherland again! What is
this, a Donald Sutherland season?!
MOMMA
I like him. I like his hair.
DIXON
Hair!
MOMMA
This is the one where his little girl
dies.
DIXON
Always a plus in a movie!
It any good?
MOMMA
It’s got a great sex scene.
Talking of dead kids, what’s happening
with the Billboard lady?
DIXON
Oh that cooze won’t listen to reason.
She’s as tough as an old boot!
MOMMA
Oh. Why don’t you just fuck her over
thru her friends then?
DIXON
Huh?
MOMMA
Y’know, why don’t you fuck her friends
over? Make her come around that way.
Has she got some friends you could fuck
over?
MILDRED
Hey fuckhead?!
DIXON
What?
SERGEANT
Don’t say ‘What’, Dixon, when she comes
in calling you a fuckhead, and don’t
you come in here...
MILDRED
Shut up!
You! Get over here.
DIXON
No. You get over here.
MILDRED
Alright...
SERGEANT
What?! Don’t... Dixon!
DIXON
What?! I’m taking care of this!
SERGEANT
You do not allow a member of the public
to call you a fuckhead in the station
house!
DIXON
That’s what I’m doing, I’m taking care
of it! In my own way. Actually. Now get
out of my ass!
Mrs Hayes. What is it I can do for you
today?
MILDRED
Where’s Denise Watson?
DIXON
Denise Watson’s in the Clank.
MILDRED
On what charge?
DIXON
Possession.
MILDRED
Of what?
DIXON
Two marijuana cigarettes. Big ones.
MILDRED
When’s the bail hearing?
DIXON
I asked the Judge not to give her bail
on account of her previous marijuana
violations and the Judge said sure.
MILDRED
You fucking prick.
DIXON
You do not call an officer of the law a
fucking prick in his own station-house,
Mrs Hayes. Or anywhere, actually.
MILDRED
What’s with the new hard-boiled
attitude, Dixon? Your momma been
coaching ya?
DIXON
No. My momma doesn’t do that.
Take ‘em down, Hayes!
She’s gone.
SERGEANT
You did good, Dixon.
DIXON
Yeah, I know I did.
WILLOUGHBY
Now, the rules here are twofold; no kid
can leave this goddam blanket at any
goddam time, and every single one of
these dolls and these teddy bears has
gotta be hooked up. Now, your momma and
I, although it won’t look like it,
we’ll be watching every goddam move you
make and the most important thing while
we’re watching you is you do not leave
this blanket. The next most important
thing is you do not at any stage allow
the fishing rods to stick into you or
your sister’s eyeballs, as this would
be counter-productive to the entire
operation. What would this be?
KIDS
Counterproductive to the entire
operation.
WILLOUGHBY
Good. Then troops... start fishing.
ANNE
We. Are. Not.
WILLOUGHBY
We are.
MILDRED
Hey baby. Yep, still no arrests. How
come, I wonder? Cos there ain’t no God
and the world’s empty and it don’t
matter what we do to each other? Ooh, I
hope not.
How comes you came up here outta
nowhere, looking so pretty? You ain’t
trying to make me believe in
reincarnation or something, are ya?
Well, you’re pretty, but you ain’t her.
She got killed, and now she’ll be dead
forever. I do thank you for coming up,
though. If I had some food I’d give it
ya, but I’ve only got some Doritos and
I’d be scared they’d kill ya, they’re
kinda pointy. Then where would we be?
The fawn finally decides to amble away, off towards the hazy
sunset horizon. She almost cries but doesn’t quite.
RED
Yeah, so I, uh, just happened to be
looking over our contract we drew up
back that time, and what I realised
was, I realised that although payment
is to be made on the first day of each
month, uh, the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit, wasn’t it, like
we said, so actually, in point of fact,
you’re actually behind in your payments
now, by, yeah, a month.
She gives him a look.
Yeah. That’s, uh, what the contract
says. Looking it over an’ all. The
lawyer says so too.
MILDRED
When do you need this next payment by,
Red?
RED
Uh, well, now, really.
Or Fuh uh... Friday?
MILDRED
Wow. When you can’t trust the lawyers
and the advertising men, what the
hell’s America coming to, huh?
Who got to ya? Willoughby?
RED
Nobody got to me.
MILDRED
My fat fucking ass!
RED
He’s dying, Mildred.
MILDRED
We’re all fucking dying!
PAMELA
Red?
RED
Oh, hi Pamela! Um, we’re a little bit
busy, at the moment, Pam, if that’s
okay...
PAMELA
Oh Red, I know, and I know you were
real anxious about talking to Mrs Hayes
this morning and all...
RED
Anxious? No...
PAMELA
But that’s the thing, there’s no need
to be, cos you won’t believe it! A
little Mexican delivery boy just
dropped in with this...
RED
What the hell’s this?!
PAMELA
I know! It’s five thousand dollars! And
guess what the note says? It says it’s
to pay for the rental on Mrs Hayes’s
billboards! Can you believe it? That’s
why I butted in!
RED
Well, who’s it from?
PAMELA
Well, it doesn’t say.
RED
Well, where’s the delivery boy?
PAMELA
Well, he went.
RED
Well, did you see what company he was
from?
PAMELA
Well, no.
RED
Well, what kinda uniform did he have
on?
PAMELA
Well, he just looked like one of those
fat little Mexican boys.
On a bicycle?
Did I do something wrong?
RED
No, Pam, you did good.
MILDRED
Yeah, Pam, you did real good.
PAMELA
Did I? Great! Ain’t life crazy?
MILDRED
What’s the note say?
RED
Says, er, “This here money is to go
towards the fund for Mildred Hayes’s
billboards, cos she ain’t the only one
round here who hates the pigs. Signed,
a friend.”
MILDRED
Jeez, I guess ya can’t be picky who
your friends are these days, huh?
Um, be good to get a little receipt off
ya, Red, y’know, saying the price of
next month’s is paid in full an’ all.
RED
Oh. Sure, Mildred, sure.
MILDRED
Yeah. Like, now.
RED
Oh! Sure!
JANE
Is mommy drunk, daddy?
WILLOUGHBY
No, no, she’s just got a little
migraine, that’s all. A little
Chardonnay migraine, now no more chit
chat out of you two, ok?
JANE
Can we stay home from school again
tomorrow, daddy?
WILLOUGHBY
We’ll see what your mommy says in the
morning, darling...
JANE
Aww!
POLLY
Aww!
WILLOUGHBY
But I’m pretty sure she’ll say yes
though...
JANE
Yay!
POLLY
Yay!
WILLOUGHBY
Now eyes closed and get some sleep,
okay?
WILLOUGHBY
You don’t smell of puke. Which is good.
ANNE
Aquafresh. Trick I learned.
WILLOUGHBY
Women, huh?
ANNE
Oh yeah. Resourceful.
WILLOUGHBY
It’s still your turn to clean the
horseshit outta the stable, y’know?
ANNE
Oh those fucking horses! They’re your
fucking horses! I’m gonna have those
fucking horses shot!
WILLOUGHBY
I’ll do it, you lazy bitch.
ANNE
Thank you, poppa.
That was a real nice day. And that was
a real nice fuck. You got a real nice
cock, Mr Willoughby.
WILLOUGHBY
Is that from a play, “You got a real
nice cock, Mr Willoughby?” I think I
heard it in a Shakespeare one time.
ANNE
You dummy. It’s Oscar Wilde.
WILLOUGHBY
“Oscar Wilde.”
ANNE
No. No. No...!
No! No! No! No!
WILLOUGHBY
My darling Anne. There’s a longer
letter in the dresser drawer I’ve been
writing for the last week or so. That
one covers us, and my memories of us,
and how much I’ve always loved you.
This one just covers tonight, and, more
importantly, today. Tonight I have gone
out to the horses to end it. I cannot
say sorry for the act itself, although
I know that for a short time you will
be angry at me or even hate me for it.
Please don’t. This is not a case of “I
came in this world alone, and I’m going
out of it alone” or anything dumb like
that. I did not come in this world
alone, my mom was there, and I am not
going out of it alone, cos you are
there, drunk on the couch, making Oscar
Wilde cock jokes. No. This is a case,
in some senses, of bravery. Not the
bravery of facing a bullet down; the
next few months of pain would be far
harder than that small flash. No, it’s
the bravery of weighing up the next few
months of still being with you, still
waking up with you, of playing with the
kids, against the next few months of
seeing in your eyes how much my pain is
killing you; how my weakened body as it
ebbs away and you tend to it are your
final and lasting memories of me. I
won’t have that. Your final memories of
me will be us at the riverside, and
that dumb fishing game (which I think
they cheated at), and me inside of you,
and you on top of me, and barely a
fleeting thought of the darkness yet to
come. That was the best, Anne. A whole
day of not thinking about it. Dwell on
this day, baby, cos it was the best day
of my life. Kiss the girls for me, and
know that I’ve always loved you, and
maybe I’ll see you again if there’s
another place.
And if there ain’t, well, it’s been
Heaven knowing you. Your boy, Bill.
DIXON
What the Hell’s going on around here?
All the COPS turn and look at him.
What?
SERGEANT
Can you stand now?
DIXON
I can stand, I can stand...
SERGEANT
I’d better get out there, say something
to ‘em. You ain’t gonna faint again,
are ya?
...that the best thing, the only thing,
to honor that man’s memory right now,
is to go to work. Is to be a good cop.
Is to walk in his shoes. Is to do what
he did, every day of his life. Help
people.
RED
What the hell’s going on, Dixon?
PAMELA
You fucking pig! What the fuck are you
doing?!
DIXON
See, Red? I got issues with white folks
too...
The fuck are you looking at?
ANCHOR 
Reports, sadly, have come in overnight,
that Chief William Willoughby of
Ebbing, Missouri, took his own life
early this morning...
...in the grounds of his home. This
report just in from Gabriella
Forrester.
GABRIELLA 
Tragedy came calling today upon this
quiet family home outside of Ebbing,
Missouri; a home belonging to Chief
William Willoughby, his wife, Anne, his
two young daughters, Polly and Jane.
What appears to be a self-inflicted
gunshot wound brought life to an end
for Chief Willoughby, a man highlyrespected in Ebbing for his diligence
and his service to the community, a
service that lasted more than 25 years.
What led him to take his life in the
early hours of this morning it is too
early to speculate;
there were rumors of illness; could it
simply have been the pressure of the
job; or could it have something to do
with a story we ran here just two weeks
ago, of these billboards, and the woman
who put them there, Mildred Hayes...
ROBBIE
Don’t.
MILDRED
Say, do you know who threw that can?
BOY
What can?
MILDRED
How about you, honey? Do you know who
threw that can?
GIRL
Uh, no, I didn’t really see...
ROBBIE
Thanks Mom.
SERGEANT
And what can I do for you today, Sir?
ABERCROMBIE
What’s your name?
SERGEANT
Name’s on my tag, man. You hard of
reading?
ABERCROMBIE
Hard of reading, no, no. That’s good,
“hard of reading”. It’s kind of like
“hard of hearing”, but it’s actually
it’s “hard of reading’, it’s like a
play on words or something.
SERGEANT
What do you want?
ABERCROMBIE
Uh, I've been sent down to uh, take
over from Chief Willoughby, in light of
last night’s unfortunate event.
DIXON
You have got to be fucking kidding me!
SERGEANT
Do you have any documentation to prove
that, Sir?
ABERCROMBIE
You really wanna see my documentation,
fucker?
DIXON
Yeah, see his documentation!
ABERCROMBIE
None o’ you cracker motherfuckers got
no work to do?
DIXON
Ain’t that racialist?
ABERCROMBIE
What happened to your hands there,
Officer Dixon?
DIXON
Oh, I just kinda banged ‘em up a little
bit while I was throwing some guy out
of a fucking window. Y’know, the usual.
ABERCROMBIE
Oh yeah? They never taught me that one
at the Academy.
DIXON
Which fucking Academy you go to?
ABERCROMBIE
How’s things coming along on the Angela
Hayes case?
DIXON
How’s things coming along on the ‘Mind
your own fucking business’ case?
ABERCROMBIE
How things coming along on the hand me
your gun and your badge?
DIXON
Huh?
ABERCROMBIE
Hand me your gun and your badge.
DIXON
I can’t find my badge. No, seriously.
Maybe I dropped it when I was doing the
window guy?
ABERCROMBIE
Just get out of my station house, man.
DIXON
I think I just got fired. Fired or
suspended, I’m not sure which...
SERGEANT
Fired.
MILDRED
Anything I can help you with, just
gimme a holler.
GUY
Give you a what?
MILDRED
A holler?
GUY
A holler, huh?
Give Mildred Hayes a holler. Okay.
MILDRED
You know me?
GUY
Only from the TV, and the radio. How
much these here ‘Welcome to Missouri’
rabbits go for?
MILDRED
Seven bucks. It’s writ right on ‘em.
GUY
Guess he ain’t seven bucks now.
MILDRED
What the Hell was it you come in here
for?
GUY
What did I come in here for? Well,
maybe I’m a good friend of
Willoughby’s, how about that?
MILDRED
Are you?
GUY
Or, y’know... maybe I was a friend of
your daughter’s or something. How about
that?
MILDRED
Were you?
MAN
Or, uh, y’know, maybe I was the guy who
fucked her while she was dying? How
about that?
MILDRED
Were you?
GUY
Oh... Naw. I would’ve liked to. I saw
her picture in the paper there.
Saved by the bell, huh?
GUY turns to leave.
MILDRED
You owe me seven fucking dollars for
the rabbit.
GUY
Guess you’ll have to get it off me next
time I’m passing through, huh Mildred?
MILDRED
I guess I will.
You don’t know how glad I am to see
you.
ANNE
What?!
MILDRED
That guy was scaring me.
ANNE
I wouldn’t have said you scare easy.
MILDRED
I ain’t the worst. What can I do for
you, ma’am?
ANNE
My husband left this for you before he
shot himself in the head last night.
MILDRED
I’m sorry, Mrs Willoughby...
ANNE
Are you? Are you really?
MILDRED
Of course...
ANNE
Surely it’s the perfect ending for you,
isn’t it? It’s proof that they’ve been
successful, these billboards of yours,
isn’t it, a dead policeman? It’s
quantifiable now.
MILDRED
Are you blaming this on me?
ANNE
No, I’m not blaming this on you. I just
came to give you the letter. Now, my
two little girls are out in the car, so
I’d better not stay and chat. I’m not
sure what we’re going to do for the
rest of the day. It’s hard to know what
to do the day your husband kills
himself. It’s hard to know what to do.
WILLOUGHBY
Dear Mildred, Dead Man Willoughby here.
Firstly I wanted to apologise for dying
without catching your daughter’s
killer. It’s a source of great pain to
me, and it would break my heart to
think you thought I didn’t care, cos I
did care. There are just some cases...
...where you never catch a break, then
five years down the line some guy hears
some other guy bragging about it in a
bar-room or a jail-cell and the whole
thing is wrapped up thru sheer
stupidity. I hope that might be true
for Angela, I really do. Second, I
gotta admit, Mildred, the billboards
were a great fucking idea. They were
like a chess move. And although they
had absolutely nothing to do with my
dying, I’m sure that everyone in town
will assume that they did, which is
why, for Willoughby’s counter-move, I
decided to pay the next month’s rent on
‘em. I thought it’d be funny, you
having to defend ‘em a whole nuther
month after they’ve stuck me in the
ground. The joke is on you, Mildred, ha
ha, and I hope they do not kill you. So
good luck with all that, and good luck
with everything else too. I hope and I
pray that you get him.
MOMMA
Well, do you want me to go down and
talk to them?
DIXON
No I don’t want you to go down and talk
to them. Jesus! Somebody sending their
goddam mother down to talk to the
goddam police, for Christ’s sakes.
And say what?
MOMMA
And say to give you your job back. And
to get rid of the black guy.
DIXON
They ain’t gonna listen to some guy’s
mother, asking them to get rid of some
black guy. Things have moved on in The
South!
MOMMA
Well it shouldn’t’ve!
Will they give you any money for being
laid off an’ all?
DIXON
I don’t know what the compensation
scheme is for when you throw a guy out
of a window, Mom. I guess I shoulda
looked into that beforehand. Let me
Google that!
MOMMA
A couple grand, maybe? You’ve been
there three years. Not counting the
five years at the Academy. Six if you
count the year you were held back.
Where ya going?
DIXON
None of your business.
MOMMA
Off to see your fancy woman?
DIXON
I don’t got a fancy woman.
MOMMA
Yeah. I know!
DIXON
You wanna watch yourself.
MOMMA
Or you’ll do what?
DIXON
Blow your goddam head off.
ROBBIE
Oh, did you hear the news?
MILDRED
What news?
ROBBIE
That Dixon guy threw that Welby guy out
his window this morning.
MILDRED
You’re shitting me. Is Welby okay?
You’re shitting me!
MILDRED
Go get the one from the house!
ROBBIE
Shouldn’t I call the fire department?
MILDRED
Fuck the fire department! They probably
started it!
ROBBIE
Well don’t do anything stupid!
MILDRED
Scumbags, scumbags, scumbags. Fucking
scumbags.
ROBBIE
What the hell are you doing, Mom?!
MILDRED
Come on...
ROBBIE
Leave it, Ma. It’s too late.
Mom, leave it, please!
ABERCROMBIE
How are those hands?
Can I ask you a coupla questions?
MILDRED
You can ask me all the questions you
want if you take me down and arrest me.
ABERCROMBIE
I’m not gonna arrest you, Mrs Hayes. I
got nothing to arrest you for.
MILDRED
Not yet you ain’t.
ABERCROMBIE
We ain’t all the enemy, y'know?
MILDRED
I’ll crucify the motherfuckers.
I’ll crucify the motherfuckers.
What are you gonna do to ‘em, Mildred?
You’re gonna crucify ‘em, you say?
That’s right, I’m gonna crucify ‘em.
Who you gonna crucify? The
motherfuckers?
That’s right, the motherfuckers.
Jeez! Well, I guess those motherfuckers
better watch out then, huh?
Fucking A!
MILDRED
What’s this shit...?
GABRIELLA
...and as sad as the spectacle of these
burned out billboards might be, in
light of the death of Chief Willoughby,
this reporter for one can’t help but
wonder whether this finally puts an end
to the strange saga of the three
billboards outside of Eb...
MILDRED
This don’t put an end to shit, you
fucking retard, this is just the
fucking start, so why don’t you put
that on your “Good Morning Missouri
fucking Wake-Up Broadcast”, bitch!
MOMMA
I see on the TV there was a buncha
fires lit outside o’ town last night.
DIXON
Buncha fires, huh?
MOMMA
Out at those billboards.
DIXON
Yeah, well, back when I was a cop I
woulda been interested in who set those
fires cos, technically, that’s arson,
but as I am no longer employed by those
people I don’t really give a good god
damn, now do I?
The Dixon residence. Oh, hey Sarge! How
you doing? You got any news?
SERGEANT 
News about what?
DIXON
I dunno, about my job and stuff?
SERGEANT
No, no. What? No. Anne Willoughby just
dropped in a letter that Bill wrote you
before he died.
DIXON
Oh my God! What’s it say?
SERGEANT 
I haven’t read it, Dixon, it’s not my
letter.
DIXON
Oh. Well, I’ll come right down...
SERGEANT
Well, uh... I don’t think that’d be
such a great idea, as things stand,
Jason. Uh, you’ve still got your keys
to the station-house though, right?
DIXON 
Yeah.
SERGEANT
Well, why don’t you just come pick it
up when everyone’s gone home. I can
leave it on your desk for ya.
DIXON
Oh. Okay.
SERGEANT 
Actually, yeah, then when you’re done
you can just leave your keys, save us
picking ‘em up later.
WILLOUGHBY 
Jason, Willoughby here. I’m dead now,
sorry about that, but there’s something
I wanted to say to you that I never
really said when I was alive. I think
you’ve got the makings of being a
really good cop, Jason, and you know
why? Because, deep down, you’re a
decent man. I know you don’t think I
think that, but I do, Dipshit. You play
hopscotch when you think no-one’s
looking, for Christ’s sakes...
I do think you’re too angry, though,..
...And I know it’s all since your dad
died and you had to go look after your
Mom and all...
...But as long as you hold onto so much
hate then I don’t think you’re ever
going to become...
...What I know you wanna become...
...A Detective.
MILDRED
Fuck ‘em!
WILLOUGHBY 
Cos you know what you need to become a
detective? And I know you’re gonna
wince when I say this...
...But what you need to become a
detective... is Love.
Because thru Love comes Calm, and thru
Calm comes Thought. And you need
Thought to detect stuff sometimes,
Jason. It’s kinda all you need.
You don’t even need a gun. And you
definitely don’t need Hate.
Hate never solved nothing...
But Calm did. And Thought did. Try it.
Try it just for a change. No-one’ll
think you’re gay.
And if they do, arrest ‘em for
homophobia! Won’t they be surprised!
Good luck to you, Jason. You’re a
decent man, and yeah you’ve had a run
of bad luck...
...But things are gonna change for
you...
I can feel it.
DIXON
Calm. Calm.
ABERCROMBIE
So what did you see?
JAMES
Well when we turned the corner from
Spring, the fire was already raging,
so, and then two seconds later the cop
guy just jumps out the window...
ABERCROMBIE
Wait, the two of you turned the corner
from Spring? Where were you before
this?
JAMES
Round at my place.
ABERCROMBIE
You two are boyfriend and girlfriend?
JAMES
Well, it’s early stages, y’know.
ABERCROMBIE
That right?
MILDRED
We’ve had a couple dates.
JAMES
So you wanna go out to dinner next
week?
MILDRED
I’ll go out to dinner with ya. But I
ain’t gonna fuck ya.
JAMES
Well, I ain’t gonna fuck you neither.
I guess.
NURSE
Burn victim. He’s pretty heavily
sedated.
RED
Hey man? You doing okay? Jeez, you got
burned up pretty bad. You’ll be okay
though, don’t worry. You want a glass
of orange juice? I got a straw
somewheres...
Hey man, don’t cry. You’ll be okay.
DIXON
I’m sorry, Welby.
RED
You know me?
DIXON
I’m sorry.
RED
Sorry for what, man?
DIXON
For throwing you out the window.
RED
Save it.
DIXON
I’m sorry.
RED
I don’t care. And stop crying. The
salt’ll just fuck up your wounds.
DIXON
I thought salt was supposed to be good
for wounds.
RED
Well what am I, a fucking doctor?!
MILDRED
Who is it?
JEROME 
Oh you don’t know me really.
MILDRED
Well what you want?
JEROME 
I come about the billboards.
MILDRED
What about ‘em?
JEROME 
They got burned up.
MILDRED
I know that.
JEROME 
I’m one of the guys who put the ‘em up
in the first place.
Jerome.
MILDRED
What can I do for ya, Jerome?
JEROME
Well, y’know, when you’re putting up a
buncha posters like that, just in case
any of ‘em gets screwed up or torn,
they give ya a set of duplicates,
y’know?
MILDRED
No, I didn’t know that.
Ladder’s pretty steady as it is, there,
James.
JAMES
Oh, I don’t mind. I like holding
ladders. It takes me out of myself.
DENISE
Need a hand?
MILDRED
When’d you get out?
DENISE
Hour ago. Judge threw it out, said the
arrest report weren’t filled out right.
Say, you didn’t burn down the police
station, did ya?
MILDRED
No...
JAMES
No. She was with me the whole night.
MILDRED
It’s a long story.
JEROME
You sure you still wanna put up the
Willoughby one, him dead an’ all?
MILDRED
Why not? He paid for it.
JAMES
Who’s that?
MILDRED
My ex-husband. And his nineteen year
old girlfriend.
JAMES
You wanna leave?
MILDRED
No, no. A deal’s a deal.
GUY 
It was fucking wild, man, I think I was
certifiably fucking insane for a while
back there.
PAL 
When was this?
GUY 
Bout nine, ten months ago.
PAL 
Were you on your own or what?
GUY 
No, had a coupla buddies with me.
PAL 
Oh yeah?
GUY 
Yeah.
PAL 
They fuck her too?
GUY 
I think they got their kicks just
watching, you know.
PAL 
Was she hot?
GUY 
After the gasoline kicked in she was
hot.
I ain’t going down for that shit, last
fucking day down there...
He been there the whole time?
PAL
Who?
GUY
Burnt-face-Jake. Keeps fucking walking
up and down.
PAL
I don’t know. I don’t think so.
GUY
Can I help you with something, man?
You’ve been looking over here all
fucking night, now, unless you got
something to say to me, why don’t you
take your burnt fucking face and get
the fuck outta here, okay?
What the fuck are you doing?!
DIXON
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...
Just trust me, okay?
Just trust me...
GUY
Just do the fucking trick.
JEROME
Hey! That’s enough now!
GUY
What’s it to ya, fucker?
JEROME
The guy’s a cop man! He’s a cop!
GUY
Oh yeah? He ain’t wearing no badge.
DIXON
I lost my badge. I can’t remember where
I lost it.
GUY
You started this, man! I didn’t do shit
to you.
DIXON
I know I started it. I scratched you up
like a bitch.
GUY
That’s exactly fucking right...
JAMES
Gotta use the little boys’ room.
MILDRED
You got something to say to me?
CHARLIE
If I’d known, we coulda double-dated.
MILDRED
Doesn’t shitgirl have a curfew
weeknights?
CHARLIE
No, no, in fact I was actually gonna
take her to the circus later, but
there’s no need now. Does he juggle?
MILDRED
I’m having one dinner with the guy cos
he did me a favor, okay?
CHARLIE
You don’t have to explain yourself to
me cos you’re having dinner with a
midget, Mildred.
MILDRED
I’m not explaining myself to you.
CHARLIE
You kinda are.
Listen, I didn’t come over to break
your balls, you can date as many
midgets as you want. No, I came over to
say I was sorry, actually.
MILDRED
Sorry for what?
CHARLIE
I’m sorry about what happened to your
billboards an’ all.
MILDRED
Yeah well, that’s all water under the
bridge now, I guess.
CHARLIE
Good. I’m glad. I was pretty drunk, but
it still don’t excuse it.
All this anger, man, Penelope said to
me the other day, it just begets
greater anger, y’know? And it’s true.
JAMES
Penelope said ‘Begets’?
CHARLIE
Yeah, ‘It begets greater anger’.
Well, you take care of this little
lady, okay sport? Big lady, compared to
you, right?
JAMES
You alright?
MILDRED
I think I’d like to go home now.
Aw don’t gimme any shit, James? We can
do this another time, alright?
JAMES
Why would I wanna do this another time?
You’ve been embarrassed to be here ever
since we arrived.
MILDRED
Oh for Christ’s sakes, James. I didn’t
force you to come on this date,
alright? You forced me.
JAMES
Forced you? I asked you on a date. Wow!
Well, y’know, I know I ain’t much of a
catch, okay?
I know I’m a midget who sells used cars
and has a drinking problem, I know
that. But who the hell are you, man?
You’re that Billboard Lady who never
ever smiles, who never has a good word
to say about anybody, and who, in the
eveningtimes, SETS FUCKING FIRE TO
POLICE STATIONS! And I’M the one who’s
not a catch?!
MILDRED
James...
JAMES
I didn’t have to come and hold your
ladder!
CHARLIE
Now don’t make a scene.
MILDRED
Did you really tell him “Anger begets
greater anger”?
PENELOPE
Oh! Yes! I did! I didn’t make it up
myself though. I can’t claim that! No,
I read it on a bookmark.
Which was in a book I was reading.
About polio.
Polo. No, which is the one with the
horses? Polio? Polo.
CHARLIE
Polo.
PENELOPE
Polo!
MILDRED
Be nice to her, Charlie. You got that?
MOMMA
Jason!
DIXON
Just leave me, Momma, don’t look at me.
MOMMA
Jason! What have they done to you?
Jason?! Jason?!
DIXON
I’m gonna be alright, Momma. It’s all
gonna be alright.
I don’t wanna get your hopes up,
alright, but there’s a guy, and I think
he might be the guy. I got his DNA. I
got a lot of it, actually. They’re
making the checks as we speak.
MILDRED
He’s in jail?
DIXON
No, but he ain’t gonna be hard to find.
MILDRED
Why do you think he’s the guy?
DIXON
I heard him talking about something
that he did to a girl in the middle of
last year. I couldn’t hear all of it,
but it sounded a lot like what happened
to Angela. Then he beat the crap outta
me. But cos of that I got a bunch of
his DNA. So I wanted to let you know
sooner rather than later. I didn’t want
you to give up hope, y’know?
MILDRED
I’ve been trying not to.
DIXON
Well, all you can do is try, as my
Momma says. Not so much about hope as
about... well, I didn’t used to be very
good at English at school, so it was
more “All you can do is try... to not
be so crap at English.” Cos you need
English, really, if you wanna be a cop.
If you wanna be anything, really.
Unless you live in Mexico or something.
But who wants that?
He gets up to go.
MILDRED
Hey Dixon?
Thanks.
ABERCROMBIE
You did good, Jason. You did real good.
But he wasn’t the guy.
DIXON
What?
ABERCROMBIE
There was no match to the DNA, no
matches to any other crimes of this
nature, to any crimes at all, in fact.
And his record is clean. Maybe he was
just bragging.
DIXON
He wasn’t just bragging.
ABERCROMBIE
Well, that’s as may be. But at the time
of Angela’s death he wasn’t even in the
country.
DIXON
Where was he?
ABERCROMBIE
But I’ve seen his records of entry and
exit to the States, and I’ve spoken to
his Commanding Officer. He wasn’t in
the country, Dixon. He ain’t our guy.
DIXON
He might not be our guy, but he still
done something shitty.
ABERCROMBIE
Not in Missouri he didn’t.
DIXON
Where was he?
ABERCROMBIE
That’s classified information.
DIXON
Come on, man.
ABERCROMBIE
If the guy’s got a Commanding Officer,
and if the guy got back to the country
nine months ago, and if the country
where he was is classified, which
country do you think he was in?
I’ll give you a clue. It was sandy.
DIXON
That doesn’t really narrow it down.
ABERCROMBIE
All you need to know is, he didn’t do
nothing to Angela Hayes. So we’re gonna
keep looking. Alright?
DIXON
I found my badge after all.
MILDRED
Hello?
DIXON 
It’s Dixon.
MILDRED
Tell me.
DIXON 
He wasn’t the guy.
MILDRED
I guess you’re sure, right?
DIXON 
He, um, he wasn’t even in the country
when it happened. So, whatever he did,
he didn’t do it round here.
I’m sorry I got your hopes up.
MILDRED
It’s alright. At least I had a day of
hoping. Which is more than I’ve had for
a while. I’d better go.
DIXON
Um, there was one thing I was thinking.
MILDRED 
What’s that?
DIXON
Well,... I know he isn’t your rapist.
He is a rapist, though. I’m sure of
that.
MILDRED
What are you saying?
DIXON 
I got his license plate. I know where
he lives.
MILDRED
Where’s he live?
DIXON 
Lives in Idaho.
MILDRED
That’s funny. I’m driving to Idaho in
the morning.
DIXON 
Want some company?
MILDRED
Sure.
MILDRED
Hey Dixon?
DIXON
Yeah?
MILDRED
I need to tell you something.
It was me who burned down the police
station.
DIXON
Well, who the Hell else would it have
been?
MILDRED
Dixon?
DIXON
Yep?
MILDRED
You sure about this?
DIXON
About killing this guy?
Not really. You?
MILDRED
Not really.
They continue on.
I guess we can decide along the way.
