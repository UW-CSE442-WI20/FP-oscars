	ELIO
	L'usurpateur.
	ANNELLA
	Dove è Elio?
	ELIO
	Il faut que je descende.
	ANNELLA
	Aiuta Oliver a portare
	le sue cose in camera tua.
	ELIO
	I’m Elio.
	OLIVER
	Hi.
	ELIO
	My room is now your room. I’ll be
	next door.
	ELIO
	We're sharing the bathroom. It's my
	only way out...
	We’re being called to dinner.
	We’re being called to dinner.
	OLIVER
	Later. I’ll have to pass.
	Can you make my excuses to your
	mother?
	So, this is usually your room..
	Thanks, buddy.
	MAFALDA
	Lasci fare a me, Signore. (Let me)
	ANNELLA
	Did you recover from your trip,
	caro?
	OLIVER
	Big time.
	ELIO
	I can show you around.
	OLIVER
	Good. Are we far from the town? I
	need to open a bank account.
	PERLMAN
	None of our residents has ever had
	a local bank account.
	ELIO
	Should I take him to Montodine?
	PERLMAN
	I’m think they’re closed for summer
	vacation. Try Crema.
	OLIVER
	Is that your orchard?
	PERLMAN
	Pesca, ciliege, albicocche...
	ANNELLA
	Pomegranate.
	Have another egg.
	OLIVER
	I know myself. If I have three,
	I’ll have a fourth, and more.
	NARRATOR
	Taking a summer guest for six weeks
	is the way Professor helps young
	academics revise a manuscript
	before publication. They are given
	full run of the house and can
	basically use their time as they
	like, provided they help Professor
	Perlman for an hour or so every day
	with his correspondence and other
	paperwork.
	PERLMAN
	The word apricot comes from the
	Arabic - it’s like the words
	“algebra”, “alchemy”, and
	“alcohol”. It derives from an
	Arabic noun combined with the
	Arabic article ‘al-’ before it.
	The origin of our Italian
	‘albicocca’ was ‘al-barquq’...
	It’s amazing that today in Israel
	and many Arab countries the fruit
	is referred to by a totally
	different name: ‘mishmish’.
	ANNELLA
	When we visited Persia they called
	it Zardoulou.
	OLIVER
	I beg to differ.
	PERLMAN
	Ah?
	OLIVER
	The word is not actually an Arabic
	word.
	How so?
	PERLMAN
	OLIVER
	It’s a long story, so bear with me,
	Pro. Many Latin words are derived
	from the Greek. In the case of
	‘apricot’, however, it’s the other
	way around.
	Here the Greek takes over from
	Latin. The Latin word was
	praecoquum, from pre-coquere, precook,
	to ripen early, as in
	precocious, meaning premature.
	The Byzantines - to go on - borrowed
	praecox, and it became prekokkia
	or berikokki, which is finally
	how the Arabs must have
	inherited it as al-barquq.
	Courtesy Philology 101.
	PERLMAN
	He’s right, he’s right.
	ELIO
	He does it every year...
	ANNELLA
	Every year.
	PERLMAN
	I was testing you.
	OLIVER
	What does one do around here?
	ELIO
	Nothing. Wait for summer to end.
	OLIVER
	What do you do in the winter, then?
	Don’t tell me: wait for summer,
	right?
	ELIO
	We come here only for Christmas and
	some other vacation..
	OLIVER
	Christmas?
	ELIO
	And Easter too. We are Jewish,
	English, American, Italian,
	French... somewhat atypical.
	Besides my family you are probably
	the only other Jew who has set foot
	in this town.
	OLIVER
	I am from a small town in New
	England. I know what its like to be
	the odd Jew out.(beat) And what
	else do you do here in summer,
	besides this?
	What do you do?
	ELIO
	Transcribe music. Read books. Swim
	at the river. Go out at night.
	ANCHISE
	Non bisogna dare troppa acqua ai
	pomodori.
	OLIVER
	Pomodori? Oh, Tomatoes...
	ANCHISE
	Sì! Tomatos.. Se crescono troppo in
	fretta saranno pieni di semi. No
	good! 
	OLIVER
	Just play it again.
	ELIO
	I thought you didn’t like it. Hated
	it...
	OLIVER
	Hated it? What gave you that
	idea?.. Just play it, will you?
	ELIO
	The same one?
	OLIVER
	The same one.
	OLIVER
	You changed it. What did you do to
	it? Is it Bach?
	ELIO
	I just played it the way Liszt
	would have played it if he’d
	jimmied around with it.
	OLIVER
	Just play it again, please!
	I can’t believe you changed it
	again.
	ELIO
	Not by much. That’s how Busoni
	would've played it if he’d altered
	Liszt’s version.
	OLIVER
	Can’t you just play the Bach the
	way Bach wrote it?
	ELIO
	Bach never wrote it for guitar. In
	fact, we’re not even sure it’s Bach
	at all.
	OLIVER
	Forget I asked.
	ELIO
	Okay, okay. No need to get so
	worked up.
	It’s young Bach, he dedicated it to
	his brother.
	NARRATOR
	Taking in summer guests was Elio’s
	dad and mom, The Perlmans, a way of
	helping young academics revise
	manuscript before publication.
	Summer residents didn’t have to pay
	anything, they were given the full
	run of the house and could
	basically do anything they pleased,
	provided they spent an hour or so a
	day helping Professor Perlman with
	his correspondence and assorted
	paperwork. Oliver manuscript was on
	Heraclithus and already had found a
	publisher in Italy for a translated
	version. Elio’s father loved
	nothing better than to have some
	precocious rising expert in his
	field of study helping him.
	ELIO
	MARZIA
	Sicuramente è meglio di quello
	dell’anno scorso, ti ricordi?
	MARIA
	Oliver è un cowboy biondo
	latinista!
	(looking at Elio and Marzia
	Bella fregatura! Un’altra estate
	nella lavanderia.
	OLIVER
	Here, let me make it better. Relax.
	ELIO
	But I am relaxing.
	OLIVER
	You’re stiff as a board. You’re
	made of knots.
	Come here, feel this...
	Here. Feel it? He should relax
	more.
	MARZIA
	You should relax more.
	MARIA
	She certainly knows how to get him
	to relax.
	ANNELLA
	C’è Zia Marcella e annessi per
	cena. Oliver si ferma con noi o
	esce stasera?
	ELIO
	Je ne sais pas.
	MAFALDA
	Che muvi star!
	PERLMAN
	Scegli una carta. OK, ricordala
	bene. 
	È questa?
	ANNELLA
	Noi ci mettiamo a tavola
	ELIO
	Non vi sembra ineducato come dice
	“Later...”? arrogante? Mi sembra
	che facciamo di tutto per farlo
	stare a suo agio da noi.
	PERLMAN
	I don’t think so. I think Oliver is
	shy. That’s what he is.
	ELIO
	You watch, this is how he’ll say
	goodbye to us when the time comes.
	With his gruff, slapdash, Later!
	ANNELLA
	Meanwhile, we’ll have to put up
	with him for six long weeks. Won’t
	we?
	PERLMAN
	I’m telling you, he’s just shy.
	You’ll grow to like him.
	ELIO
	Yeah, but what if I grow to hate
	him?
	ANNELLA
	Mio piccino!
	Può togliere i piatti di Mr.
	Oliver? 
	ELIO
	Non mi va.
	PERLMAN
	Perchè non ti va?
	ELIO
	Perché non mi va!
	ANNELLA
	Pourquoi tu ne vas pas
	à Moscazzano avec les autres?
	ELIO
	J’en ai pas envie.
	ANNELLA
	Go see your friends. Go out. Do
	something.
	Ne reste pas là comme une araignée
	sur le mur, mon chéri!
	Spoiling everyone’s fun.
	PERLMAN
	I think your insights here are
	persuasive, but..
	OLIVER
	Go on, I’m okay with criticism.
	PERLMAN
	You are? Good. I think this needs
	firming up.
	It feels like you need to accept
	the paradoxical nature of this
	philosopher’s thinking, not just
	explain it..
	ELIO
	Sei stato al fiume?
	ANCHISE
	Si.
	OLIVER
	I’m okay with firming up - I’m okay
	with paradox. Back to the drawing
	board.
	Wait...
	PERLMAN
	Did you have a good time last
	night?
	OLIVER
	Are you sleeping?
	ELIO
	I was.
	OLIVER
	Just listen to this drivel: “For
	the early Greeks, Heidegger
	contends, this underlying hiddenness
	is constitutive of the way
	beings are, not only in
	relation to themselves but also to
	other entities generally. In other
	words, they do not construe hiddenness
	merely or primarily in terms
	of entities' relation to human
	beings.”
	Does this make any sense to you?
	Not to me. Nor to your dad.
	ELIO
	Maybe it did when you wrote it.
	OLIVER
	That’s the kindest thing anyone’s
	said to me in months.
	ELIO
	Kind?
	OLIVER
	Yes, kind.
	NARRATOR
	Oliver had three personalities
	depending on which bathing suit he
	was wearing. Red: for bold, set in
	his ways, gruff and ill-tempered
	snappy... dangerous.
	Yellow: good-humored, funny, but
	not without barbs - didn’t give in
	too easily.
	He didn’t wear his green bathing
	suit that often. It meant maybe
	that he was eager to learn, eager
	to speak, just eager, sunny.
	OLIVER
	Elio! What are you doing?
	ELIO
	Reading my music.
	OLIVER
	No you’re not.
	ELIO
	Thinking, then.
	OLIVER
	About?
	Private.
	ELIO
	OLIVER
	So you won’t tell me?
	ELIO
	So I won’t tell you.
	OLIVER
	So he won’t tell me.
	In that case I’m going with your
	mom.
	OLIVER
	Why aren’t you with the others at
	the river?
	ELIO
	I’m... I’m... I have... an allergy.
	OLIVER
	Me too. We might have the same one.
	Want to go for a swim? Just the two
	of us?
	ELIO
	Later, maybe.
	OLIVER
	Let’s go now.
	ELIO
	Must we?
	OLIVER
	I’m going to change. What about
	you?
	OLIVER
	See you downstairs!
	CHIARA
	Enough now. We’re going to the
	river and you’re coming.
	OLIVER
	Let me sort these papers out. Or
	his father will skin me alive.
	CHIARA
	En parlant de peau, approche.
	Tell his father that I crumpled his
	papers. We'll see what he says
	then..
	I could do a better job translating
	than whoever this is.
	OLIVER
	Do you type good too?
	CHIARA
	I type good.
	OLIVER
	As good as you speak good?
	CHIARA
	Bettah. And I’d give you a bettah
	price too. Stand still.
	OLIVER
	I need five pages translated per
	day, to be ready for pickup every
	morning.
	Looking up at him.
	CHIARA
	Then I won’t do nu’in for you.
	Don’t move.
	Find yuh-sef somebuddy else.
	MARZIA
	Allons nous baigner.
	ELIO
	Yeah, come on.
	OLIVER
	Thanks, Buddy.
	MALE FRIEND # ONE
	Ma ci sta provando? 
	MALE FRIEND # TWO
	Ha già cuccato? 
	ELIO
	Che ne so. 
	MALE FRIEND # ONE
	Quanto vorrei essere nei suoi
	panni. 
	FEMALE FRIEND # ONE
	Chi non vorrebbe essere nei panni
	di lei, piuttosto.. (Who wouldn’t
	want to be in her shoes, I say..)
	MARZIA
	Lo vuole a tutti i costi, eh.
	MARZIA
	Tu n'es pas avec moi
	parce que tu es fâché contre
	Chiara?
	ELIO
	Pourquoi je serais fâché contre
	Chiara ?
	MARZIA
	A cause de lui.
	Retourne-toi. Ne me
	regarde pas.
	ELIO
	Retrouvons-nous ici demain soir.
	Je serai là avant toi.
	MARZIA
	Ne le dis à personne.
	ELIO
	We almost did it. Marzia and me.
	PERLMAN
	And why didn’t you?
	ELIO
	Dunno.
	OLIVER
	Better to have tried and failed...
	ELIO
	All I had to do was find the
	courage to reach out and touch, she
	would have said yes.
	OLIVER
	Try again later.
	ANNELLA
	Try later, what?
	PERLMAN
	I just heard from the people in
	Sirmione, they say they’ve come up
	with something. I’m going there
	today, would you like to go with
	me?
	OLIVER
	I’d like that very much.
	ELIO
	Can’t I come too?
	PERLMAN
	On condition that you remain
	silent.
	OLIVER
	Silent as in too many opinions on
	things, or silent as in Security:
	not telling anybody what fabulous
	things have been dug up?
	PERLMAN
	Nothing is being dug up. It’s what
	has been brought up - out of the
	water.
	ELIO
	On va au lac de Garde
	avec mon père. Il veut montrer à
	Oliver l'endroit où ils draguent.
	CHIARA
	Dis-lui que je suis passée.
	ELIO
	Il est à l'intérieur, il aide mon
	père. Tu étais incroyable sur la
	piste, hier soir.
	CHIARA
	Il danse très bien.
	ELIO
	Et il est beau aussi, non?
	CHIARA
	Tu veux jouer les entremetteurs?
	ELIO
	Dad always sits up front with
	Anchise to navigate.
	She seems to like you a lot - She’s
	more beautiful than she was last
	year.
	I saw her naked on a night swim.
	She has a great body.
	OLIVER
	Are you trying to make me like her?
	ELIO
	What would be the harm in that?
	OLIVER
	No harm. Except I like to go at it
	alone, if you don’t mind.
	PERLMAN
	Guido io oggi, non ti preoccupare.
	Non fare quella faccia Anchise!
	prenditi il pomeriggio libero.
	OLIVER
	Don’t play at being the good host,
	just don’t.
	PERLMAN
	What’s going on, boys? Oliver, come
	sit up front and be my navigator.
	PERLMAN
	The ship went down in 1827 on the
	way to the villa of Count Lechi
	here on this island.
	ELIO
	Dad, why are we only finding him
	now?
	PERLMAN
	A good question. His partner -
	they’re a pair - is in the Vatican.
	There are four known sets, after
	the Praxiteles originals. This
	fellow is Number Three. The Emperor
	Hadrian had a pair, dug up at
	Tivoli, but one of the more
	philistine of the Farnese popes
	melted them down and had them
	recast as a particularly voluptuous
	Venus that was traded to Napoleon
	later on.
	OLIVER
	I guess they didn’t need two pairs.
	No..
	PERLMAN
	Who would like to go for a swim
	before we head back?
	PERLMAN
	They’re all such rogues. Our boxer
	could be on a plane to the Geneva
	antiquities market tonight for all
	I know.
	ELIO
	I have to go!!
	The two men smile at Elio's passionate haste.
	PERLMAN
	Are you going too?
	OLIVER
	No Prof, I have to work.
	PERLMAN
	How about a drink to celebrate the
	day?
	OLIVER
	That would be great.
	ANNELLA
	Have you seen my Heptameron?
	PERLMAN
	It must be over there...
	ANNELLA
	This version is in German, but I’ll
	translate: Ein gut aus sehender
	junger Ritter ist wahnsinnig
	verliebt in eine Prinzessin. Sie
	auch ist in ihn verliebt.
	“...A handsome young knight is
	madly in love with a princess. She
	too is in love with him...
	...obwohl es so scheint, als sei
	sie sich nicht vollig ihrer eigenen
	Liebe bewusst.
	...though she seems not to be
	entirely aware of it.
	Despite the friendship...
	Freundschaft... that blossoms
	between them, or perhaps because of
	that very friendship, the young
	knight finds himself so humbled and
	speechless that he is totally
	unable to bring up the subject of
	his love. One day he asks the
	princess point-blank: Ich bitte
	euch ratet mir was besser ist...
	reden oder sterben. ‘Is it better
	to speak or die’.
	ELIO
	I’d never have the courage to ask
	such a question.
	PERLMAN
	We were your age once. The things
	you feel and think only you have
	felt, believe me, We’ve suffered
	through all of them, and more than
	once - some you never get over and
	others you’re as ignorant about as
	you are today.
	ANNELLA
	Make new friends if the old ones
	don’t interest you but stop haning
	around the house all the time.
	Books, books, books, always books,
	et toutes ces partitions... (is all
	those score books)... play more
	tennis, go dancing more often with
	Chiara and Marzia - tu les aimes
	no? (you like them, don’t you?) Get
	to know people...
	PERLMAN
	Find out why others are so
	necessary in life and not just
	foreign bodies to be sidled up to.
	ANNELLA
	Fai anche pazzie se devi. 
	ELIO
	My mom’s been reading this 16th
	century French romance. She read
	some of it to my Dada and I the day
	the lights went out.
	OLIVER
	About the knight who doesn’t know
	whether to speak or die? You told
	me already.
	ELIO
	Yes.
	OLIVER
	Well, does he or doesn’t he?
	ELIO
	Better to speak, she said. But
	she’s on her guard. She senses a
	trap somewhere.
	OLIVER
	So does he speak?
	ELIO
	No, he fudges.
	OLIVER
	That figures. Listen, I need to
	pick up something in town.
	ELIO
	I’ll go, if you want me to.
	OLIVER
	Let’s go together.
	ELIO
	Now?
	OLIVER
	Why, have you got anything better
	to do?
	No.
	ELIO
	OLIVER
	So let’s go.
	ELIO
	You didn’t have to.
	OLIVER
	I wanted to.
	ANCHISE
	I straightened the wheel. It took
	some doing. I also put air in the
	tires
	OLIVER
	Grazie.
	I fell the other day on the way
	back and scraped myself pretty
	badly. Anchise insisted on applying
	me some sort of witch’s brew. He
	also fixed the bike for me.
	ELIO
	Does he give you the creeps?
	OLIVER
	Who?
	ELIO
	That’s what my aunt says. Anchise.
	OLIVER
	Of course not. Just a lost soul,
	really, like most of us.
	OLIVER
	You want to try one?
	37.
	Not bad, right?
	ELIO
	Not bad at all. I thought you
	didn’t smoke.
	OLIVER
	I don’t.
	World War II? Did the Allies fight
	near here?
	ELIO
	No. This is World War I. You’d have
	to be at least eighty years old to
	have known any of them.
	OLIVER
	Is there anything you don’t know? I
	never heard of the Battle of Piave.
	ELIO
	I know nothing Oliver. Nothing,
	just nothing.
	OLIVER
	You know more than anyone around
	here.
	ELIO
	If you only knew how little I know
	about the things that really
	matter.
	OLIVER
	What things that matter?
	ELIO
	You know what things. By now you of
	all people should know.
	OLIVER
	Why are you telling me all this?
	ELIO
	Because I thought you should know.
	OLIVER
	Because you thought I should know.
	ELIO
	Because I want you to know
	Because there is no one else I can
	say this to but you.
	OLIVER
	Are you saying what I think you’re
	saying?
	Yes.
	ELIO
	ELIO
	You know I’m not going anywhere.
	OLIVER
	They’ve mixed up my pages and now
	they have to retype the whole
	thing. So I have nothing to work on
	this afternoon. Which sets me back
	a whole day. Damn!
	mistake.
	ELIO
	I wish I hadn’t spoken.
	OLIVER
	I’m going to pretend you never did.
	ELIO
	Does this mean we’re on speaking
	terms - but not really?
	OLIVER
	Look, we can’t talk about such
	things, we really can’t.
	ELIO
	Follow me. I’ll show you a spot
	visitors have never seen. That is,
	if you have time.
	This is my spot. All mine. I come
	here to read. I can’t begin to tell
	you the number of books I’ve read
	here.
	OLIVER
	It's freezing cold!
	ELIO
	The spring is in the mountains, the
	Alpi Orobie. The water comes
	straight down from there.
	OLIVER
	Do you like being alone?
	ELIO
	No one likes being alone. But I’ve
	learned how to live with it.
	OLIVER
	Are you always so wise? So very
	wise?
	ELIO
	I’m not wise at all. I told you, I
	know nothing. I know books, and I
	know how to string words together -
	it doesn’t mean I know how to speak
	about the things - about the things
	that matter most to me.
	OLIVER
	But you’re doing it now - in a way.
	ELIO
	Yes, in a way - that’s how I always
	say things: in a way.
	I come here to escape the known
	world.
	OLIVER
	I like the way you say things. Why
	are you always putting yourself
	down?
	ELIO
	I don’t know. So you won’t, I
	suppose.
	OLIVER
	Are you so scared of what others
	think? Or what I think?
	You’re making things very difficult
	for me.
	ELIO doesn’t back down. Neither does OLIVER.
	ELIO
	Why am I making things difficult?
	OLIVER
	Because it would be very wrong.
	ELIO
	Would?
	OLIVER
	Yes, would. I’m not going to
	pretend this hasn’t crossed my
	mind.
	ELIO
	I’d be the last to know.
	OLIVER
	Well, it has. There! What did you
	think was going on?
	ELIO
	Going on? Nothing...nothing.
	OLIVER
	I see. You’ve got it wrong, my
	friend - if it makes you feel
	better, I have to hold back. It’s
	time you learned to do that too.
	You’re the luckiest kid in the
	world.
	ELIO
	You don’t know the half of it.
	So much of it is wrong.
	OLIVER
	What? Your family?
	ELIO
	That too.
	OLIVER
	Us, you mean?
	Better now?
	I think we should go.
	ELIO
	Not yet.
	OLIVER
	We can’t do this - I know myself.
	So far we’ve behaved. We’ve been
	good. Neither of us has done
	anything to feel ashamed of. Let’s
	keep it that way. I want to be
	good.
	43.
	ELIO
	Don’t be. I don’t care. Who is to
	know?
	Did I offend you?
	OLIVER
	Just don’t.
	I should make sure it doesn’t get
	infected.
	ELIO
	We can stop by the pharmacist on
	the way back.
	ELIO
	We’ll never speak again, you know..
	OLIVER
	Don’t say that.
	ELIO
	I just know it. We’ll chit-chat,
	chit-chat, chit-chat. And the funny
	thing is, I can live with that.
	OLIVER
	You just rhymed.
	ELIO
	Ghiaccio, ice, Mafalda, per favore,
	presto!
	OLIVER
	Elio! Where are you?
	Was it my fault?
	ELIO
	I’m a mess, aren’t I?
	OLIVER
	I guess. The ancients said it never
	hurts to be bled from time to time.
	ELIO
	Sit for a second.
	Where did you learn to do that?
	OLIVER
	My Jewish grandmother. She did it
	all the time to us.
	ELIO
	I have one of those.
	OLIVER
	You don’t ever wear it?
	ELIO
	My mother says we are Jews of
	discretion.
	OLIVER
	I guess that fits your mom...
	ELIO
	You’re going to kill me, you know
	that? Ouch!
	OLIVER
	I hope not.
	Are you going to be okay?
	ELIO
	I’ll get over it.
	OLIVER
	Come on, stand up. Lie on the
	couch, rest a little. I’ll stick
	around.
	CHIARA
	How is he? Will he live?
	OLIVER
	I think so. He gave me a scare.
	Bleeding all over the dining table.
	CHIARA
	Really? I’ll be back in a minute.
	Don’t go anywhere.
	CHIARA
	Ça t'a fait mal ? Pourtant,
	tu as des pieds de paysan
	qui ne sentent rien. Paysan!
	MARZIA
	Laisse-le tranquille!
	CHIARA
	Doucement. Tu vas encore le faire
	saigner.
	Alors... On sort ou pas?
	ELIO
	Peut-être. Mais si on sort, il ne
	faut pas que ma mère me voie, elle
	s'inquiéterait.
	Où est Oliver?
	CHIARA
	Qu’est-ce que j’en sais?
	MAFALDA
	Faccio io.
	ELIO
	No, no, faccio da solo.
	Est-ce qu’Oliver est là?
	ANNELLA
	N’est il pas sorti?
	MAFALDA
	Signora vuole un frullato pure lei?
	ANNELLA
	No grazie Mafalda, ceniamo tra
	poco. 
	ELIO
	Io esco stasera, non ceno
	MAFALDA
	Ma dove vai a quest’ora? Mi fai
	preoccupare. 
	ELIO
	Ma di che?
	MAFALDA
	Secondo me non va bene. Signora...
	ANNELLA
	Lasciamolo fare.
	Tu l’aimes bien, n’est-ce pas,
	Oliver?
	ELIO
	Tout le monde aime Oliver.
	ANNELLA
	Il t’aime bien aussi - plus que
	toi, je pense.
	ELIO
	C’est ton impression?
	ANNELLA
	Non c’est celle d’Oliver.
	ELIO
	Quand t’a-t-il dit cela?
	ANNELLA
	Il y a un moment.
	ELIO
	Traitor. Traitor!
	ANNELLA
	Guarda un po’ quanto sei pallido.
	PERLMAN
	I pray to God you made a killing
	last night, otherwise I’ll have to
	answer to your father.
	OLIVER
	I never lose, Pro.
	PERLMAN
	Does your father approve?
	OLIVER
	I pay my own way. I’ve paid my way
	since high school. My father
	couldn’t possibly disapprove.
	PERLMAN
	Did you have a lot to drink last
	night?
	OLIVER
	That - and other things.
	PERLMAN
	I don’t think I want to know.
	OLIVER
	Neither does my father. And to be
	perfectly frank, I don’t think I
	care to remember myself.
	PERLMAN
	Do you save your winnings?
	OLIVER
	Save and invest, Pro.
	PERLMAN
	I wish I’d had your head at your
	age; I would have spared myself
	many mistaken turns.
	OLIVER
	Mistaken turns? I can’t picture you
	even imagining a mistaken turn.
	PERLMAN
	That’s because you see me as a
	figure, not a human being. Worse
	yet: as an old figure. But there
	were. Mistaken turns, that is.
	Everyone goes through a period of
	traviamento - when we take, say, a
	different turn in life, the other
	via. Dante himself did. Some
	recover, some pretend to recover,
	some never come back, some chicken
	out before ever starting, and some,
	for fear of taking any turns, find
	themselves leading the wrong life
	all life long.
	OLIVER
	Sometimes the traviamento turns out
	to be the right way, Pro. Or as
	good a way as any. I know myself.
	PERLMAN
	At your age I knew nothing. But
	today everyone knows everything,
	and everyone talks, talks, talks.
	ANNELLA
	Perhaps what Oliver needs is sleep,
	sleep, sleep.
	OLIVER
	Tonight, I promise, Signora P., No
	poker, no drinking. I’ll put on
	clean clothes, go over my
	manuscript, and after dinner we’ll
	all watch TV and play canasta, like
	old folks in Little Italy.
	ELIO
	I waited for you last night.
	OLIVER
	Why didn’t you come into town?
	Dunno.
	ELIO
	OLIVER
	We had a nice time. You would have
	too. Did you rest at least? Mafalda
	said you went swimming.
	ELIO
	I was okay. Restless, I guess.
	Are you headed into town this
	morning?
	OLIVER
	Later, maybe.
	ELIO
	I was going to head into town
	myself.
	OLIVER
	Ummmm. I see.
	ELIO
	A book I ordered finally arrived.
	OLIVER
	I’ll pick it up for you if you
	want.
	ELIO
	It was just that I was hoping we’d
	go together.
	OLIVER
	You mean like the other day?
	ELIO
	I don’t think we’ll ever do
	anything like that again. But yes,
	like that.
	That day belongs to a different
	time warp. We should leave sleeping
	dogs -
	OLIVER
	That voice of wisdom is your most
	winning trait. Do you like me that
	much, Elio?
	ELIO
	Do I like you? Do I like you,
	Oliver? I worship you.
	OLIVER
	I’ll go with you but - no speeches.
	ELIO
	No speeches, not a word.
	OLIVER
	What do you say we grab our bikes
	in half an hour?
	NARRATOR (V.O.)
	Two young men travelling by bike,
	riding into town and back... They
	swam, played volley-ball, ate,
	drank, and late at night ran into
	each other on the very same
	piazzetta where two mornings before
	so much - but actually nothing -
	was said between them. Oliver was
	with a girl, Elio also was with a
	girl. If he hadn't messed things up
	with his dramatics, Elio could have
	enjoyed this for its own sake.
	Every day they could have ridden
	into town and back, and even if
	that was all Oliver was willing to
	give Elio, he would have taken it.
	OLIVER
	Zwischen Immer und Nie... This is the best
	present I’ve received all year.
	ELIO
	I’m glad then. I just wanted to...
	I know - no speeches. Ever.
	ANNELLA
	Our muvi star...
	OLIVER
	I’ll miss all this, Mrs. P.
	ANNELLA
	And we will certainly miss you.
	PERLMAN
	You must think of this place as
	your second home - or third, or
	fourth, whatever. But the welcome
	mat will definitely be out
	Isn’t that true?
	ELIO
	Any time...
	ANNELLA
	Ennnnnni taaim...
	PERLMAN
	How is the work going?
	OLIVER
	It’s going.
	PERLMAN
	Planning to go into town tonight?
	OLIVER
	Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow.
	PERLMAN
	No poker either?
	ANNELLA
	Not in here!
	MARZIA (VOICE)
	Tu es encore malade?
	ELIO
	C'était rien. Tu veux sortir ? Je
	peux passer te prendre en vélo, on
	peut aller...
	MARZIA
	OK, je viens.
	ELIO
	Ca t’a dérangé?
	MARZIA
	Bien sûr que non.
	MARZIA
	Pourquoi tu m’as acheté ce livre?
	ELIO
	Parce que j'en avais envie.
	MARZIA
	Oui, mais pourquoi tu l'as acheté
	pour moi?
	Pourquoi m'acheter un livre à moi?
	ELIO
	Je comprends pas ta question.
	MARZIA
	N’importe qui comprendrait pourquoi
	et toi tu ne comprends pas!
	ELIO
	Je te suis toujours pas.
	MARZIA
	Tu es désespérant.
	ELIO
	Si tu ne me le dis pas, je vais
	imaginer des choses...
	MARZIA
	Sei un coglione. Donne-moi une cigarette.
	Tu lis vraiment autant que ça ?
	Je veux direi: moi aussi,
	j'aime lire, mais je ne le dis à
	personne.
	ELIO
	Pourquoi tu ne le dis pas?
	MARZIA
	Je ne sais pas... Les gens qui
	lisent sont cachottiers. Ils
	cachent ce qu'ils sont vraiment.
	Les gens qui cachent n'aiment pas
	toujours ce qu'ils sont.
	ELIO
	Tu caches qui tu es vraiment?
	MARZIA
	Parfois. Pas toi?
	ELIO
	Si, sûrement. Tu le fais avec moi
	aussi?
	MARZIA
	Non, pas avec toi. Ou si, peutêtre,
	un petit peu.
	ELIO
	Comment ça?
	MARZIA
	Tu sais très bien ce que je veux
	dire.
	ELIO
	Pourquoi tu dis ça?
	MARZIA
	Pourquoi? Parce que je pense
	que tu peux me faire souffrir
	et que je ne veux pas souffrir.
	Pas
	parce que tu cherches à blesser,
	mais parce que tu changes toujours
	d'avis, alors, on ne sait donc
	jamais à quoi s'en tenir. Tu
	m'effraies. 
	Tu m'embrasses encore?
	MARZIA (CONT’D)
	Comme tu es dur!
	Embrasse-moi encore.
	He does so.
	Ma tu mi vuoi veramente bene? 
	ELIO
	Je suis désolé! Je suis désolé!
	ELIO
	Way over the top.
	OLIVER
	Did you enjoy yourself last night?
	ELIO
	Insomma
	PERLMAN
	Must be tired then. Or were you
	playing poker too?
	ELIO
	I don’t play poker.
	PERLMAN
	Several hundred color slides of our
	boxer and the others like him
	arrived yesterday from Berlin. We
	should start cataloging them. That
	will keep us busy until lunch I
	imagine.
	PERLMAN
	Beautiful aren’t they?
	OLIVER
	They’re amazing. But these are far
	more... sensual.
	PERLMAN
	Because these are more Hellenistic
	than fifth-century Athenian, most
	likely sculpted under the influence
	of the greatest sculptor in
	antiquity: Praxiteles. Their
	muscles are firm- look at his
	stomach for example- and yet never
	a straight body in these statues,
	they are all curves, sometimes
	impossibly curved and so
	nonchalant, hence their ageless
	ambiguity. As if they’re daring you
	to desire them.
	ANNELLA
	And don’t forget Mr. Keller and Mr.
	Hodell are coming for dinner
	tonight.
	ELIO
	Otherwise known as Laurel and
	Hardy.
	PERLMAN
	Okay...
	ANNELLA
	I want you to wear the shirt they
	gave you for your birthday. It
	will make them happy.
	ELIO
	It’s way too big on me. It looks
	ridiculous.
	See if Oliver doesn’t think I look
	like a scarecrow in it. I’ll model
	it for you.
	OLIVER
	What's the time?
	OLIVER
	Mafalda, non sarò con voi a cena
	stasera. 
	MARZIA (IN FRENCH)
	Tu ne bandes pas.
	ELIO (IN FRENCH)
	Ne fais pas ça ici.
	MARZIA (IN FRENCH)
	Montons dans ta chambre.
	ELIO (IN FRENCH)
	J'ai une meilleure idée.
	MARZIA
	On va où???
	ELIO
	I can’t put it on now! They’ve
	already met me. It will look like a
	put-up job.
	PERLMAN
	No misbehaving tonight. When I tell
	you to play, then play! You’re too
	old not to accept people as they
	are. What’s wrong with them? I
	don’t think it’s very attractive of
	you to call them ‘Laurel and Hardy’
	behind their backs...
	ELIO
	Mom called them that.
	PERLMAN
	...and then accept gifts from them.
	Is it because they’re gay or
	because they’re ridiculous? Is that
	it? I hope not. And if you know as
	much about economics when you’re
	Zafar’s age you’ll be a very wise
	man indeed and a credit to me. Now
	get into this.
	ELIO
	I’m afraid I have to go to bed now.
	OLIVER
	I’m glad you came. I could hear you
	moving in your room and for a while
	I thought you were getting ready to
	go to bed, had changed your mind.
	ELIO
	Change my mind? Of course I was
	coming.
	So you do smoke?
	OLIVER
	Sometimes.
	ELIO
	I’m nervous.
	OLIVER
	Me too.
	ELIO
	I am more so.
	OLIVER
	Come, sit.
	You okay?
	ELIO
	OLIVER
	What are you doing?
	ELIO
	Nothing.
	69.
	OLIVER
	That’s a start.
	Does this make you happy? You
	aren’t going to have a nosebleed
	are you?
	You sure you want this?
	We haven’t talked.
	Can I kiss you?
	Off, and off, and off, and off...
	You’re okay?
	Call me by your name and I’ll call
	you by mine.
	ELIO
	Did we make noise?
	OLIVER
	Nothing to worry about.
	ELIO
	Mafalda always looks for signs.
	OLIVER
	She won’t find any.
	ELIO
	You wore that shirt on your first
	day here. Will you let me have it,
	leave it here when you go?
	OLIVER
	You’re not happy. You’re feeling
	sick about it, aren’t you?
	I knew we shouldn’t have. I knew
	it. We should have talked.
	ELIO
	Maybe.
	OLIVER
	Did you hate it?
	ELIO
	No, I didn’t hate it at all.
	OLIVER
	You can go back to sleep, if you
	want.
	ELIO
	Let’s go swimming.
	OLIVER
	Are you going to hold last night
	against me?
	ELIO
	No.
	OLIVER
	Take your trunks off.
	Sit down.
	Well, this is promising. You’re
	hard again. Good.
	I’m going to town, I have to
	collect my typed up pages. Later
	I'd like to show them to you,
	Professor.
	PERLMAN
	Later.
	Before you leave we'll certainly
	find the time to go over these
	revisions.
	OLIVER
	So.. Later!
	OLIVER
	Something wrong?
	ELIO
	I just had to see you.
	OLIVER
	Aren’t you sick of me?
	ELIO
	I just wanted to be with you.
	If you want, I’ll go back now.
	OLIVER
	Do you have any idea how glad I am
	we slept together?
	ELIO
	I don’t know.
	OLIVER
	It’s just like you not to know. I
	don’t want you to regret any of it.
	I just dread the thought of having
	messed you up. I don’t want either
	of us to have to pay one way or
	another.
	ELIO
	I’m not telling anyone. There won’t
	be any trouble.
	OLIVER
	I didn’t mean that. I’m sure I’ll
	pay for it somehow, though. For
	you, however you think of it, it’s
	still fun and games, which it
	should be. For me it’s something
	else which I haven’t figured out,
	and the fact that I can’t scares
	me.
	ELIO
	Are you sorry I came here?
	OLIVER
	I’d kiss you if I could.
	ELIO
	Fuck me, Elio.
	Put them over there.
	OLIVER
	I was looking everywhere for you...
	What are you doing up here?
	What have you done?
	Is this what I think it is?
	You tried out the plant kingdom?
	Next will be minerals? You’re
	rejecting the animal kingdom
	already? That would be me, I
	suppose.
	ELIO
	I’m sick, aren’t I?
	Oliver pulls off his bathing suit.
	OLIVER
	I wish everyone were as sick as
	you. Want to see sick?
	Now may I taste it?
	ELIO
	Don’t!
	OLIVER
	The peach juice helps a lot.
	Want to try it?
	ELIO
	Let it go! No!
	Look, you don’t have to do this.
	I’m the one who came after you.
	Everything that’s happened is
	because of me -
	OLIVER
	Nonsense. I wanted you from day
	one. I just hid it better.
	ELIO
	You’re hurting me.
	OLIVER
	Then let go.
	Whatever happens between us, Elio,
	I just want you to know..
	ELIO
	What?
	OLIVER
	Don’t ever say you didn’t know.
	ELIO
	What are you thinking about?
	OLIVER
	Things. Going back to the States.
	The courses I have to teach this
	fall. My book. You.
	ELIO
	No one else?
	OLIVER
	No one else.
	ELIO
	In two weeks you’ll be back at
	Columbia. I don’t know what I’ll do
	then. At least you’ll be somewhere
	else, where there aren’t any
	memories... We wasted so many days -
	so many weeks.
	OLIVER
	Wasted? I don’t know.
	ELIO
	...why didn’t you give me a sign?
	OLIVER
	I did. At least I tried.
	ELIO
	When?
	Revision79.
	OLIVER
	Once, when we were playing
	volleyball, I touched you... Just
	as a way of showing... I liked you.
	The way you reacted made me feel
	I’d almost molested you. I decided
	to keep my distance.
	PERLMAN
	Elio e Oliver si sono proprio
	trovati. 
	ANNELLA
	Sì, hanno una bella amicizia.
	PERLMAN
	È un peccato che parta.. 
	Sta tornando il fresco. 
	ELIO
	Americans never know how to do it.
	PERLMAN
	I’m sure we have our way..
	MARZIA
	Tu as disparu pendant trois jours.
	ELIO
	I.. had to work.
	MARZIA
	Mais tu as disparu...
	Am I your girl?
	ELIO
	I hurt her feelings. Love hurts.
	PERLMAN
	Oliver told me he has to go to
	Bergamo for a couple of days to do
	some research at the university
	there before he leaves. He would
	then fly home directly from Linate
	ANNELLA
	Oh... maybe Elio could go with him?
	It would be nice for them to get
	away for a couple of days. (beat)
	Where would they stay?
	PERLMAN
	He said something about a pensione.
	ANNELLA
	Oh, no! Let’s make them a hotel
	reservation. A pensione, oy!
	ELIO
	They’re too big for even two men to
	get their arms around.
	OLIVER 
	Let’s see. 
	ELIO 
	Not here. Not in all this, not on 
	this stone. 
	ELIO
	What?
	OLIVER
	Listen!
	ELIO
	Listen to what?
	OLIVER
	This song!
	ELIO
	There’s no song. You’re
	hallucinating.
	OLIVER
	Let’s go!
	OLIVER
	Psychedelic Furs. The best!
	Li ho visti a New York l’anno
	scorso. Richard Butler..
	spettacolo!
	RAGAZZA NEW ROMANTIC
	Davvero? Li abbiam visti anche noi
	in concerto! Siamo andati a Londra
	facendo l’àutostop...
	OLIVER
	Best way to travel around!
	ELIO
	It's the best day of my life and I
	end it with puking!
	ELIO
	Did you get your passport?
	OLIVER
	Yeah, I did.
	There's emptiness behind your eyes/
	there's dust in our hearts/ Love my
	way, it's a new road...
	I follow where my mind goes, so
	swallow all your tears, my love/
	And put on your new face/ You can
	never win or lose, if you don't run
	the race.
	ELIO
	Mafalda? Maman... Bonjour. Oui, je
	vais bien. Je suis à Clusone, à la
	gare. Oui... il est parti. Maman,
	s'il te plaît, tu pourrais venir me
	chercher?
	MARZIA
	Ciao.
	How are you?
	ELIO
	Good, thanks.
	87.
	MARZIA
	J'ai lu le livre que
	tu m'as offert, les poèmes.
	Ils sont très beaux. J’aime
	beaucoup cette Antonia Pozzi.
	“Nell’aria della stanza - non te
	guardo - ma già il ricordo del tuo
	viso” 
	I'm sorry you feel so bad. I just
	wanted to tell you that I'm not mad
	at you. I love you. 
	On reste amis?
	ELIO
	Pour la vie?
	MARZIA
	Pour la vie.
	ANCHISE
	Il signor Ulliva è partito? 
	ELIO
	Sì, stamattina.
	ANCHISE
	Anche a me duole. 
	MAFALDA
	I fixed up your room the way it
	was.
	PERLMAN
	So? Welcome home. Did Oliver enjoy
	the trip?
	ELIO
	I think he did.
	PERLMAN
	You two had a nice friendship.
	Yes.
	ELIO
	PERLMAN
	You’re too smart not to know how
	rare, how special, what you two had
	was.
	ELIO
	Oliver was Oliver.
	PERLMAN
	“Parce-que c’etait lui, parce-que
	c’etait moi.”
	ELIO
	(trying to avoid talking
	about Oliver with his
	father)
	Oliver may be very intelligent -
	PERLMAN
	Intelligent? He was more than
	intelligent. What you two had had
	everything and nothing to do with
	intelligence. He was good, and you
	were both lucky to have found each
	other, because you too are good.
	ELIO
	I think he was better than me.
	PERLMAN
	I’m sure he’d say the same thing
	about you, which flatters the two
	of you.
	When you least expect it, Nature
	has cunning ways of finding our
	weakest spot. Just remember: I am
	here. Right now you may not want to
	feel anything. Perhaps you never
	wished to feel anything. And
	perhaps it’s not to me that you’ll
	want to speak about these things.
	But feel something you obviously
	did.
	Look-
	you had a beautiful friendship.
	Maybe more than a friendship. And I
	envy you. In my place, most parents
	would hope the whole thing goes
	away, to pray that their sons land
	on their feet. But
	I am not such a parent. In your
	place, if there is pain, nurse it.
	And if there is a flame, don’t
	snuff it out. Don’t be brutal with
	it. We rip out so much of ourselves
	to be cured of things faster, that
	we go bankrupt by the age of thirty
	and have less to offer each time we
	start with someone new. But to make
	yourself feel nothing so as not to
	feel anything - what a waste!
	Have I spoken out of turn?
	Then let me say one more thing. It
	will clear the air. I may have come
	close, but I never had what you two
	had. Something always held me back
	or stood in the way. How you live
	your life is your business.
	Remember, our hearts and our bodies
	are given to us only once. And
	before you know it, your heart is
	worn out, and, as for your body,
	there comes a point when no one
	looks at it, much less wants to
	come near it. Right now there’s
	sorrow. Pain. Don’t kill it and
	with it the joy you’ve felt.
	We may never speak about this
	again. But I hope you’ll never hold
	it against me that we did. I will
	have been a terrible father if, one
	day, you’d want to speak to me and
	felt that the door was shut, or not
	sufficiently open.
	ELIO
	Does mother know?
	PERLMAN
	I don’t think she does.
	NARRATORE
	They had become each other that
	summer. And long after every
	forked road in life had done its
	work this would always be true.
	Their lives scarcely touched in
	those weeks together, but they had
	crossed to the other side, where
	time stops and heaven reaches down
	to earth and gives us that ration
	of what is from birth divinely
	ours. They could look the other way
	and speak of everything but, they
	would always know. They had found
	the stars, Elio and Oliver. And
	this is given once only.
	OLIVER (V.O.)
	Elio? Are you there?
	ELIO
	I’m here, I’m here. How are you?
	OLIVER (V.O.)
	Fine. How are your parents?
	ELIO
	Fine, too... I miss you.
	OLIVER (V.O.)
	I miss you too. Very much. I have some news.
	ELIO
	What news? You’re getting married,
	I suppose.
	OLIVER (V.O.)
	I might be getting married this
	spring.
	ELIO
	You never said anything.
	OLIVER (V.O.)
	It’s been off and on for two years.
	ELIO
	But that’s wonderful news!
	OLIVER (V.O.)
	Do you mind?
	ELIO
	You’re being silly.
	There is a long silence. ELIO’s genuine congratulatory smile
	fades.
	ANNELLA
	Why aren’t you here? When are you
	coming? Elio misses you terribly,
	going around all the time with such
	a long face!
	PERLMAN
	You caught us while in the process
	of choosing the new you for next
	summer..
	ELIO
	They know about us...
	OLIVER
	I figured.
	ELIO
	How?
	OLIVER (V.O.)
	From the way your father spoke - he
	made me feel like a member of the
	family - almost like a son-in-law.
	You’re lucky. My father would have
	carted me off to a correctional
	facility.
	ELIO
	“Elio, Elio”
	OLIVER (V.O.)
	Oliver.. I remember everything ...
	ANNELLA
	E questo?
	ANNELLA
	Elio, Elio
