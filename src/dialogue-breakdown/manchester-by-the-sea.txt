MR MARTINEZ
I don’t know why the hell it keeps
dripping. All night long, drip,
drip. I’ve had the fucking thing
repaired ten times.
LEE
You need a new stopper.
MR MARTINEZ
Oh is that it?
LEE
See how it’s rotted around the
edges? It doesn’t make a seal, so
the water drips into the bowl. I
can bring you a new one tomorrow,
or you might want to consider
replacing the whole apparatus.
MARTINEZ
What do you recommend?
LEE
Well, I could replace the stopper
first, and if that doesn’t work,
then I would come back and replace
the whole apparatus.
MARTINEZ
But you don’t have a professional
recommendation?
LEE
It’s really up to you.
MARTINEZ
Well, tomorrow I got my sister-inlaw coming over with my nephews
 and I gotta take my car in 
MRSGROOM
No, it’s my sister Janine’s oldest
girl’s bat mitzvah No, I look
forward to being bored to death 
No, the girl doesn’t want it, the
father doesn’t want it. I don’t
ask. Seven hours in the car, I
could really slit my throat Oh,
well, the little girls are
charming.
MARIANNE
I am so sorry. This is so gross.
LEE
It’s all right.
MARIANNE
Oh Lee, you don’t have to do that,
honestly.
LEE
That’s OK.
MARIANNE
Well  God. Thank you so much, I
am so sorry.
No, tell him to come!   Okay,
yeah   But Cindy, I have to tell
you something. I'm like, in love
with my handyman. Is that sick?  
Have you ever had a sexual fantasy
about your handyman?   Well, it's
awkward because he is literally
like, cleaning the shit out of my
toilet bowl right now. And I don't
think I'm at my most alluring  
Yeah, maybe you're right. It's not
like I met him socially   Okay
thank you Cindy. You’re a really
good friend   OK like twenty
minutes. ‘Bye!
LEE
All set.
MARIANNE
Thank you so much. Can I give you a
tip?
LEE
You mean, like a suggestion?
MARIANNE
No  I mean  like, a tip 
LEE
That’s all right. Have a good
night.
MARIANNE
Oh, please. I’d feel bad.
LEE
OK, thanks a lot. Good night.
MARIANNE
Good night! And thank you so much.
MRSOLSEN
How many times do we have to fix
these fucking pipes? Every time I
take a shower their entire
apartment has a flood. It’s driving
me insane.
LEE
I’ll bring the plumber tomorrow but
I’d say we’re gonna have to break
through the tile and try to isolate
the leak, because there was quite a
lot of water 
MRSOLSEN
But how do you know it’s me? Why is
it automatically me?
LEE
Because if it was coming from
higher up you’d have water damage
on the ceiling too, and maybe in
your wall, and it’s all dry.
MRSOLSEN
Great.
LEE
It might just be the caulking. This
whole tub needs to be re-caulked.
Did you take a bath or shower in
the last couple of hours?
MRSOLSEN
Yes 
LEE
Well, it could actually just be
that.
MRSOLSEN
OK. And how are you planning to
find that out?
LEE
Well, we could turn on the shower
and see if it drips downstairs 
MRSOLSEN
You want me to take a shower now?
LEE
No 
MRSOLSEN
You want me to take a shower while
you stand there watching, to see if
the water drips down into the
Friedrich’s apartment?
LEE
I don’t really give a fuck what you
do, Mrs. Olsen. I just want to find
the leak.
MRSOLSEN
No, you can get out of my apartment
and don’t ever come back.
LEE
OK.
MRSOLSEN
How dare you fucking talk to 
me like that? Get the fuck
out of my house before I call 
the police! 
LEE
You’re blockin’ the doorway.
EMERY
What the fuck’s matter with you?
You can’t talk to the tenants like
that!
Look, Lee. You do a good job.
You’re dependable. But I get these
complaints all the time. You’re
rude, you’re unfriendly, you don’t
say good mornin’. I mean come on!
LEE
Mr Emery, I fix the plumbing. I
take out the garbage. I paint their
apartments. I do electrical work 
which we both know is against the
law. I show up on time, I’m workin’
four buildings and you get all the
money. So do whatever you’re gonna
do.
EMERY
Would you be willin’ to apologize
to Mrs Olsen?
LEE
For what?
EMERY
All right, all right, I’ll talk to
her.
GIRL
Oh my God, I’m sorry! Did I
get you? Yeah. Lemme get a
napkin. Lenny, could I get a
couple of napkins? Here you
are 
LEE
That’s OK. I’m OK 
Thanks.

BARTENDER

BARTENDER

OK. Thank you.
Mr Emery, it’s Lee again. I
contacted Jose, who says he can
cover for me til Friday night at
least, and then Gene MacAdavey can
take over till I get back. I’ll be
in Manchester at least a week or
two. I’ll call again when I have
more information. Goodbye.
Come on, come on.
GEORGE
Hiya, Lee.
LEE
Is he dead?
IRENE
I’m sorry, Lee. He passed away
about an hour ago.
LEE
Oh.
IRENE
I’m so sorry.
LEE
Did you see him?
GEORGE
Yeah. I mean  No 
IRENE 
George br  
GEORGE
I brought him in.
 We were lookin’ at the boat this
mornin’, and he just  I don’t
know, he just, like, fell over. I
thought he was kiddin’ me at first.
Then I called the ambulance  and
uh  that was it.
IRENE
I’ll just call Dr Muller and tell
him that you’re here.
LEE
Where’s Dr Betheny?
IRENE
Oh, she’s on maternity leave. Oh
here he is.
 MULLER
Lee? I’m Dr Muller. We spoke on the
phone.
LEE
Yeah. Hi.
MULLER
I’m very, very sorry.
LEE
Thank you.
MULLER
Hello, George.

Hiya Jim.
MULLER
How you holding up?
GEORGE
Oh Great! You know.
MULLER
Well it’s a very sad day.
GEORGE
Yeah.
LEE
Where’s my brother?
MULLER
He’s downstairs. You can see him if
you want.
LEE
What happened?
MULLER
Well, you know his heart was very
weak at this point, and it just
gave out. If it’s any comfort, I
don’t think he suffered very much.
I’m sorry you didn’t get here in
time, but as I told you on the
phone
LEE
Aw, fuck this.
Sorry.
MULLER
That’s perfectly all right.
GEORGE
That’s OK, buddy.
LEE
Did anybody call my Uncle?
GEORGE
Their Uncle Donny.
LEE
Yeah, my Aunt and Uncle.
Somebody shoulda called them.
What?
GEORGE 
No, Lee Lee, no 
Donny got a job in Minnesota,
like
LEE
Minnesota?
GEORGE 
awhile ago. Yeah: He got a 
job with some outfit in 
Minnetonka, Minnesota, if you 
can believe that. Joe didn't 
tell you about that? 
LEE
No.
GEORGE
I can call ‘em if you want, Lee.
And tell ‘em what happened.
LEE
OK. Thanks 
Tell ‘em Tell ‘em what 
happened. Tell ‘em I’ll call 
‘em tonight, probably
tomorrow. Talk about
arrangements.
GEORGE
Oh, no problem 
Sure, I can do that.
LEE
And somebody better call my wife.
There is a confused, embarrassed hesitation.
 MULLER
Your 
LEE
Ex-wife. Yes. Sorry. 
I meant Randi.
GEORGE
You mean Randi?
That's OK  I already 
thought of that. I'll take 
care of it.
LEE
OK, thanks.
GEORGE
No problem.
LEE
Can I see him now?
MULLER
Sure.
GEORGE
Lee  I can wait up here, Lee, in
case you need anything.
LEE
OK.
GEORGE
I'm sorry.
IRENE
Would you like a Kleenex?
GEORGE
Thanks. Yeah.
LEE
How is Dr Betheny?
MULLER
Oh, she's doing very well. She just
had twin girls.
LEE
Oh yeah. Irene told me.
MULLER
Apparently weigh about eleven
pounds apiece. So she's gonna have
her hands full for a while I’ll
call her this afternoon and tell
her what happened.
LEE
She was very good to him.
MULLER
Yes she was.
BETHENY
The disease is commonly referred to
as congestive heart failure 
ELISE
Oh my God!
BETHENY
Are you familiar with it?
ELISE
No !
JOE
Then what are you sayin’ “Oh my
God” for?
ELISE
Because what is it?
JOE
She’s tryin’ to explain it to us,
honey. I’m sorry, Dr Beth uh 
DR BETHENY
Betheny:
JOE
I’m sorry. I can never get it
right.
DR BETHENY
Don’t worry about it. Not a
problem.
STAN
So, you were saying, Dr Beth.
JOE
It’s Dr Betheny, Dad. 
LEE
Dr Betheny, Daddy, try to get 
it right.. 
ELISE
It’s a comedy routine!
JOE 
Would you let her tell it? 
STAN
Elise, please 
ELISE
Oh my God: When am I gonna put one
foot right?
JOE
Honey, for Christ’s sakes!
ELISE
How about a hint?
STAN
Elise Sweetheart Let’s just let
her explain the situation to us 
LEE
Daddy 
STAN
What? She's fine. We're all upset.
We're all gonna listen, then we're
gonna ask everything we wanna ask,
and then we’re gonna figure out
what do to, together. Right?
JOE
Right.
DR BETHENY
It's a gradual deterioration of the
muscles of the heart. It’s usually
associated with older people, but
in rarer cases it will occur in a
younger person. Some people can
live as long as fifty or sixty
years with just an occasional
attack. But most people suffer
periodic episodes, like the one you
had on Monday, which mimic the
symptoms of a heart attack and
which further weaken the muscle.
They can put you out of commission
for a week, two weeks. And you’ll
need to be hospitalized so we can
monitor your heart, because the
risk of cardiac arrest is elevated
for a week or two.
ELISE
Oh my God.
STAN
OK OK 
DR BETHENY
But in between these episodes, most
people feel perfectly healthy and
you can basically live a normal
life.
JOE
So What do you mean that some
people live as long as fifty or
sixty years? You mean total? Or
from when they're diagnosed with
this, or what? And tell me the
fuckin’ truth.
DR BETHENY
Total.
DR BETHENY
For approximately eighty percent of
patients your age the most common
statistical life expectancy is five
years or less.
JOE
Wow.
DR BETHENY
But the statistics vary widely, and
they’re just statistics. You’re not
a statistic, you’re just one
person, and we don't know what’s
going to happen to you yet. But
it’s not a good disease.
JOE
What’s a good disease?
DR BETHENY
Poison Ivy.
ELISE
I do not see where the humor lies
in this situation.
STAN
Elise, you must calm down.
JOE
Honey, please 
DR BETHENY
I’m sorry. I’m really not 
trying to  
LEE
Don’t  it’s fine.
ELISE
No. No more  I’m not gonna 
STAN 
Elise, let’s get you a glass 
of water 
ELISE  
No m No. 
LEE
Daddy. Forget it.
JOE 
Hey, shut up.
ELISE
Yeah, forget it. Forget it like you
No, you know what? I’m tired of
bein’ the bad guy here.
JOE 
Jesus Christ! Who’s in the 
fuckin’ hospital?! 
STAN
Nobody th 
ELISE
Right! So I’ll be the bad guy, and
you be in the hospital and explain
the jokes to your son. I’m goin’
home.
JOE 
You’re goin’ home. 
STAN
Sweetheart 
Lemme get her back.
LEE
Fuck her.
JOE
You wanna stop with that
shit?
STAN
Come on with that stuff 
already! 
 MULLER
Thank you, Tony.
LEE
OK.
 MULLER
Take your time.
Thanks, Tony.
LEE
I gotta get up to Manchester.
Nobody told Patrick, right?
 MULLER
No  you had asked us to wait for
you to get here 
LEE
Yes  Thank you. So What is the
procedure now?
 MULLER
Well  You should make
arrangements with a funeral parlor,
and they pretty much take care of
everything.
LEE
I don't know the name of one.
 MULLER
We can help you with that.
IRENE
Yeah.
LEE
And they come up and get him?
 MULLER
Yes.
IRENE
Yes.
GEORGE
I’ll make those calls, Lee 
Lemme know if you need any 
help with anything. 
LEE
OK. And  OK. Thanks. And 
Yeah. Plus I gotta call you
about the boat, and the web
site. All that shit.
GEORGE
Sure. I’m around.
LEE
OK. I better get up there before
school lets out.
 MULLER
You just have to sign for Joe’s
belongings.
PATRICK
Like that?
LEE
Yeah, only keep your thumb off the
line, ‘cause if you get a strike
it's gonna slice it right open. And
you know what happens then.
PATRICK
What?
LEE
The sharks are gonna smell that
blood and rip this boat apart.
PATRICK
No they won’t. Dad, will they?
JOE
Oh yeah. I seen a school of sharks
tear a boat to pieces like it was
made of cardboard, just ‘cause some
kid threw a band-aid in the water.
PATRICK
No you didn’t.
LEE
Sometimes the only way to keep ‘em
off is to throw the kid directly in
the ocean to distract ‘em.
PATRICK
Shut up. Sharks don’t even swim in
schools.
JOE
Is this kid smart or what?
LEE
Yep. And a really smart kid is
exactly the kind of quality meal a
humongous school of sharks is
lookin’ for when they’re circlin’ a
boat.
PATRICK
Uncle Lee! Shut up!
LEE
Strike! Strike!
Ease up on the drag 
And watch that fuckin’ thumb!
JOE
Look out, look out!
You got a strike!
Ease up, ease up!
PATRICK
No swearing!
LEE
Don't hit me  ! Catch the 
fish! We're doin’ fine. Just drive the boat. 
Patty, pull up sharp! Come
on, buddy! There you go!  Mind your business!
JOE
What are you guys doin’? Hook
the fish! Get the hook in him
before he  ! I’m drivin’
the goddamn boat. Get that
hook in him!
PATRICK
What kind of fish is it?
JOE
Gotta be a great white, Patty 
Maybe a barracuda  
LEE
Feels like a great white 
shark to me. 
PATRICK
Shut up!
RANDI 
Hello?
LEE
Hi honey! Hi, Suzy.
Daddy’s home. Hi, Suzy.
Daddy’s home.
SUZY
Hi Daddy.
LEE
Hi, sweetheart.
SUZY
Hug.
LEE
Jesus Christ, you’re breakin’
my neck.
RANDI 
Lee?
LEE
Yeah, hiya!
LEE
Hi honey.
RANDI
You have a good time?
LEE
Yeah, really good. Where’s your
mother?
RANDI
They just left.
LEE
Oh no.
RANDI
Yeah, she really missed you.
LEE
There’s always next time. Did you
sleep?
RANDI
Oh, yeah. It’s always restful when
my mother’s here.
LEE
That’s too bad. Hi Kary.
KAREN
Hi Daddy.
LEE
Hello sweetheart.
KAREN
Put me down.
LEE
I’m puttin’ you down. Relax.
LEE
Hey, hey, hey! 
RANDI
Karen !
LEE
Honey, don’t jerk around like that,
I almost dropped you on your head.
KAREN
I’m making a hair salon.
LEE
Oh yeah? It’s really good. You
wanna cut my hair?
KAREN
It’s just for girls. I’m sorry.
LEE
I understand. How you
feelin’?
RANDI
Little better.
LEE
You sound better.
RANDI
Did you actually use the fishin’
tackle?
LEE
Yeah, we really did. Patrick got a
humongous bluefish. Eighteen
pounds.
RANDI
Oh yeah? That’s awesome!
LEE
I never seen anybody so happy in my
life.
It’s nice in here. You keep it
nice. What a homemaker.
RANDI
Fuck off.
Get away from me.
No, don't, stop, I'm sick.
OK, get offa me.
LEE
Hi Stanny. How come you’re not
cryin’?
RANDI
Let him alone. He’s been quiet for
half an hour.
LEE
Half an hour. What is that
about? Take it easy. Hiya buddy. You are
very handsome.
RANDI
Oh Lee, please don't pick him
up!
If he’s not makin’ any noise,
leave well enough alone.
LEE
“Leave well enough alone.” That’s
what me and Mummy shoulda done
instead of gettin’ married.
RANDI
Just shut up.
LEE
 but then you wouldn’t be here.
And neither would your sisters. And
I could watch the football game in
my own livin’ room. That’s right, I
could.
RANDI
Go fuck yourself.
LEE
See? I didn’t make him cry. ‘Cause
I know how to handle him.
RANDI
How was Joe?
LEE
He’s all right. You know? He’s
doin’ all right.
RANDI
And you didn’t run outta beer? You
got through the day OK?
LEE
Oh yeah. We were very temperate.
RANDI
I don’t know why you guys bother
gettin’ on the friggin’ boat.
LEE
Because we love the sea.
I only had eight beers over a seven
hour period. That’s approximately
one point four two somethin’ beers
per hour.
RANDI
No, it’s almost like a normal
person stayin’ sober.
LEE
I told you I was cuttin’ down.
RANDI
What do you think you’re gonna do?
LEE
I guess I’m gonna take a shower.
Randi, I swear to God. You shoulda
seen the look on Patty’s face when
he caught that fish. It was like
takin’ Suzy on the merry-go-round.
It was like  pure happiness.
RANDI
Get away. I’m sick. I’m deeply
sick.
LEE
He’s not at school?
I thought school let out at
three o'clock  What? I'm
sorry. My cell phone  what?
PAUL
I'm pretty sure he 
I'm pretty sure he woulda 
That's all right. I’m pretty 
sure he woulda left for 
hockey practice by now. 
LEE
He’s on the hockey team?
PAUL
Yeah, he’s doin’ real well, too.
How’s Joe doin’? He gonna be OK?
LEE
He’s fine. Where’s the practice at?
The school?
PAUL

COACH

CJ
He’s got congestive heart
failure. Patrick’s dad, I

PATRICK
I don’t know. What does he look
like?
LEE
He looks like he's dead. I
mean, he doesn't look like he's
asleep, or anything like that. He
doesn't look gross  You
don't have to. I wanted to see him.
Maybe you don't want that image in
your memory. I don't know. It's up
to you.
LEE
What do you think? Should I take
you home? Do you want me to decide?
PATRICK
Let's just go.
LEE
What the fuck are you doing?
PATRICK
I just said let’s go inside!
LEE
No, you just said “Let’s just go!”
And then you get out of the
car without telling me?
What the fuck’s the matter
with you?
I coulda ripped your fuckin’
leg off, that’s my problem.
PATRICK
Yeah, I meant let’s go
inside. I meant let’s just go
look at him!
OK, OK! What’s your problem?
OK! I’m sorry I misused the
English language!
I’m sorry, Uncle Lee.
LEE
I’m sorry too. I just got scared.
PATRICK
OK. Thank you.

 MOM
Hello, Patrick.
 PATRICK
Hi, Mrs Galvin.
DAD

rumpus for?
Well, keep your shirt on

LEE
Hello, Jeff. Hello, Arlene.
DAD

 PATRICK
Hey guys. How’s it goin’? 
LEE
 Sorry about the ruckus.
MOM

PATRICK
He’s fine.
PATRICK
You gotta hit the bleeper.
LEE
I don’t have the bleeper.
PATRICK
I’ll do it. There’s a code.
PATRICK
Is it OK if some of my friends come
over? I told ‘em I would call ‘em.
LEE
Go ahead.
PATRICK
Can we get some pizza? There’s
nothing to eat here.
LEE
Yeah. Sure. 
What kind do you want?
PATRICK
Any kind is fine. Thank you.
SILVIE
At least he didn’t suffer. It’s
worse for the family, but it’s
better for the person.
CJ
Well, he was a fuckin’ great guy,
Patrick, I’ll tell you that.
JOEL
That’s for sure.
CJ
I remember one time he took us all
out in the boat? Like in sixth
grade?
CJ
And he made us wear life
preservers? And I was like,
“What’s the difference, Mr
Chandler? Boat sinks in this
weather we’re dead anyway.”
And he says “The life 
jacket’s to make it easier on
the sharks when you go over.”
PATRICK
Yeah, he really liked those shark
jokes.
JOEL
He was funny, boy.
SILVIE
Yeah, but he was gentle too, you
know Like
his son.
CJ
And there’s this former
starship captain  this
former starship captain, shut
up 
JOEL
Star Trek sucks.
Star Trek sucks my ass.
SILVIE
How you doin’, baby?
 PATRICK 
OK.
CJ 
Star Trek is one of the 
pillars of modern 
entertainment. 
 JOEL 
One of the pillars of modern 
entertainment is retarded. 
CJ
No it’s not! Ask Patrick! Ask 
him! Moron! 
JOEL
Read my lips. Star Trek is 
retarded. It’s retarded. 
SILVIE
I can’t believe we’re talking about
Star Trek right now!!
PATRICK
I like Star Trek 
PATRICK
Hey, Uncle Lee? Is it OK if Silvie
sleeps over? Dad always let her.
LEE
Then what are you asking me for?
PATRICK
No reason. Thanks So  Not
that it would come up, but her
parents think she stays downstairs
when she stays over? So if it comes
up for some reason, can you just
say she stayed in the downstairs
room?
LEE
I don’t even know them.
PATRICK
Yes you do. It’s the McGanns. Frank
and Pat McGann.
LEE
That’s Silvie McGann?
PATRICK
Yeah. So do you mind sayin’ she
stayed downstairs? Like if they
call or something?
LEE
OK.
Am I supposed to tell you to use a
condom?
PATRICK
No I mean  Unless you really
feel like it.
LEE
Is that what Joe would say?
PATRICK
No. I mean, yes. I mean, we’ve had
“The Discussion” and everything.
LEE
OK.
PATRICK
Just lemme know if we’re makin’ too
much noise.
LEE
OK.
PATRICK
Hey. Do you think I should call my
mom? To tell her about Dad?
LEE
I wouldn’t, Patty. I don’t think
anybody even knows where she is 
PATRICK
All right. I was just curious what
you thought. Anyway Good night,
Uncle Lee.
LEE
Good night.
JOE
 and now you’re gonna sulk all
night because you dropped the
goddamn ball?
PATRICK 
I’m not sulking.
 JOE 
Shut up! If you
would use a goddamn baseball
mitt you wouldn’t drop the
fuckin’ ball.
Shaddup, shaddUP, you stupid
dogs! ELISE!
LEE 
Why don’t you stop already?
You wanna stop?
Why don’t you kill him?
I think you should kill him.
PATRICK 
I don't need a baseball mitt.
I catch better without one!
Ah, shit.
PATRICK
Dad! No cursing!
JOE
Lee, you wanna take Patty upstairs
and get him washed up? Go on up,
Patty. Everything’s OK.
LEE
Come on, buddy.
JOE
Oh, come on.
LEE
Beverly, Massachusetts  
Gallagher Funeral Home please  
SILVIE
Morning.
LEE
Hello.
PATRICK
Pass the milk please.
LEE
So but, I don't know what I gotta
do to get his body from the
hospital to your place, but they
said   Oh, OK 
SILVIE
Excuse me, Mr Chandler? I don’t
think Patrick needs to be here for
this.
PATRICK
That’s all right.
LEE
So why is it more to drive his body
to Manchester? ‘Cause you gotta
take the highway for seven minutes?
What do you charge if the hearse
takes 127?
SILVIE
Jesus. Like that’s his focus?
PATRICK
He’s alright.
PATRICK
Thanks, Uncle Lee.
SILVIE
Thanks a lot, Mr Chandler.
BOY
Hey, Patrick. Sorry to hear about
your dad, man.
PATRICK
Oh  Thanks, man. Thank you.
COACH
We’re gonna forget about the
language. We’re gonna forget about
the fists. But I want you to take a
few days offa practice. I don’t
want you on the ice. You got enough
on your mind.
PATRICK
That’s OK, Mr Howard. To tell you
the truth, I could use the
distraction 
COACH
The ice is not a distraction. When
you’re on the ice, you gotta be
there. Take the week and we’ll
talk. And listen: I lost my dad
right about your age. So I know
what you’re goin’ through. So if
you wanna come in and talk, or you
just want somebody to spill your
guts to  or you just wanna throw
the bull around, door’s open.
PATRICK
You mind if I put some music on?
LEE
No.
PATRICK
You like these guys? The lead
guitar is weak but otherwise
they’re pretty good.
LEE
They all sound the same to me.
PATRICK
Where we going?
LEE
To see the lawyer.
PATRICK
What for?
LEE
We gotta read your father’s will.
PATRICK
Can’t you just drop me at home and
tell me what it says in it?
LEE
Well, yeah  except we’re there.
PATRICK
Who do you think he left the boat
to?
LEE
I’m sure he left you everything.
LEE
Eat my fuckin’ forehand, Tommy!
TOM
Once! That was once! He punts
the ball sixteen times and
now he’s Superman.
LEE
I got it workin’ now. Just
keep away from this quadrant 
and you won’t go home in
tears.
RANDI
Would you keep it down, you fuckin’
morons? My kids are sleepin’.
LEE
I’m sorry, honey. I
told you guys to keep it down.
RANDI
Lee, you wanna get these
fuckin’ pinheads outta my
house please?
GUYS
Yeah, Sorry, Ran/ I told you
guys to keep it down.
Randi leaves.
LEE
She can’t talk that way to us.
TOM
Yeah. We’re not pinheads.
RANDI
Hey! I’m not fuckin’ around! It’s
two o’clock in the fuckin’ mornin’!
Get these fuckin’ assholes dressed
and get ‘em the fuck outta here.
LEE
I don’t understand.
WES
What  part are you having trouble
with ?
LEE
I can’t be Patrick’s guardian.
WES
I understand it’s a serious
responsibility 
LEE
No  I mean  I mean, I can’t 
WES
Well  Naturally I assumed that
Joe had discussed this with you 
LEE
No. He didn’t. No.
WES
Well I must say I’m somewhat
taken aback 
LEE
He can’t live with me:
I live in one room.
WES
But if you look  Now, well,
if you look, you’ll see Joe
provided for Patrick’s
upkeep: Clothes, food, et
cetera The house and boat
are owned outright 
LEE
I don’t see how I could be his
guardian.
WES
Well, those were your brother’s
wishes.
LEE
Yeah but I can’t commute from
Boston every day until he turns
eighteen.
WES
I think the idea was that you would
relocate.
LEE
Relocate? Where? Here?
WES
If you look at 
Well, yes. As you can see, your
brother worked everything out
extremely carefully.
LEE
But  He can’t have meant
that.
WES
And if you  Well, you can
see he’s allowed up to five
thousand dollars to help you
with the move. There's a
small amount set aside for
you to draw from, as personal
income while you settle in 
assuming of course that you
accept 
LEE
What about Uncle Donny and Teresa?
WES
Well, they did come up. But Joe
didn’t feel that Patrick really had
any special relationship or feeling
about them 
LEE
I don't understand.
Minnesota.
Minnetonka, Minnesota.
WES
And now, I think you know
they've moved out to
Wisconsin, I believe..
Minnesota, that's right.
So 
It was my impression you’ve spent a
lot of time here over the years 
LEE
Just as backup. I came up to stay
with Patty whenever Joe was in the
hospital, after my dad couldn’t do
it. We  It was supposed to be my
Uncle Donny. I was just the backup.
WES
Well I can only repeat, I’m
astonished that Joe never ran all
this by you, thorough as he was.
LEE
Yeah, because he knew what I would
say if he would have asked.
See Jupiter? Good night! Keep 
your eyes on the road! You 
see Jupiter? Keep your eyes 
on the road! Good night 
Tommy! Good night Joe! Sorry 
again! See the 
North Star? There's the North 
Star, right there! 
GUYS 
Good night, Lee! Tell Randi 
we’re sorry! We’re so sorry! 
Good night, etc. 
TOM
Where?
LEE
It’s due north !
I’ll clean up in the morning, baby.
RANDI
You see Jupiter you fucking
asshole?
LEE
Come on 
WES
Lee 
WES’S ASSISTANT
Patrick? Can I get you a soda or
anything?
PATRICK
No thank you.
WES
Lee Nobody can appreciate what
you’ve been through If I can say
that. And if you really don’t feel
you can take this on, that’s your
right, obviously 
LEE
But who would get him?
WES
The probate court would appoint a
guardian in your place.
LEE
Like who?
My Uncle Donny?
WES
I don’t know  No  Not
necessarily. Especially, now
with the distance.
LEE
Who else would there be?
WES
Well I don’t know what’s
happening with Patrick’s mother 
LEE
No. No.
WES
I’m not sure where she is, or
what her condition is  But
you can bet the judge would
certainly look into it.
LEE
 No Can’t do that.
WES
There is Patrick to be considered.
RANDI
Let me go! Get your hands off me!
Let go of me! Somebody go in there!
Let me go! Get them outta there!
WES
Look  Lee 
LEE
Thanks, Wes. I’ll, uh, I’ll
be in touch.
LEE
You know. We were partyin’ pretty
hard.
Beer, and somebody was passin’
around a joint. Somebody else had
some cocaine.
DETECTIVE
Cocaine?
LEE
Yes.
DETECTIVE
OK. Go on.
LEE
Anyway, our bedroom’s in the
downstairs. The girls sleep
upstairs. So Randi makes everybody
leave around two o’clock, maybe
three AM, and she went back to bed.
So everybody leaves, and I go
inside. And it’s really cold
inside, so I go check on the girls,
and it’s fuckin’ freezing up there.
We sleep downstairs. The girls
sleep in the upstairs. But Randi
doesn’t like the central heat
because it dries her out her
sinuses, and she gets these
headaches. So I went downstairs and
built a fire in the fireplace, and
I sit down to watch TV, except
there’s no more beer. And I’m still
jumpin’ like a jackrabbit. So I put
a couple big logs on the fire so
the house would warm up when I was
gone, and I went to the minimart It’s about a fifteen minute
walk both ways. But I didn’t wanna
drive cause I was really wasted.
And I’m halfway there, and I
remember I didn’t put the screen
back on the fireplace. But I figure
it’s probably OK. So I kept going
to the store. And that’s it. One of
the logs musta rolled out on the
floor when I was gone. The girls
were all upstairs  And that’s it.
The firemen got Randi out. She was
passed out downstairs. And then
they said the furnace blew, and
they couldn’t go inside again. And
that’s all I remember.
DETECTIVE
OK, Lee. That’s all for now. We’ll
call you if anything else comes up
we want to ask you about.
MARSHALL
Assumin’ the forensics bear you
out which I’m assumin’ that they
will 
LEE
What do you mean? That’s it?
MARSHALL
Look, Lee: You made a horrible
mistake. Like a million other
people did last night. But we don’t
wanna crucify you. It’s not a crime
to leave the screen off the
fireplace.
LEE
So What? I can go?
MARSHALL
Unless somethin’ else comes up that
we don’t know about already, yeah.
DETECTIVE
You got a ride back home?
LEE
Yeah.
JOE
Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!
LEE
Alright. Let’s go.
PATRICK
Where to, the orphanage?
LEE
Shut up.
PATRICK
What the hell did I do?
LEE
Just be quiet.
All right. We got a lot to do.
PATRICK
What about the boat?
LEE
We gotta talk to George about it.
There’s no point hangin’ onto it if
no one’s gonna use it 
PATRICK
I’m gonna use it.
LEE
It’s gotta be maintained 
PATRICK
I’m maintaining it.
I’m gonna maintain it.
LEE
 we gotta change the rental
of the boat yard from Joe to
me  No, you can’t maintain
it by yourself 
PATRICK
Why not?
It’s my boat now, isn’t it?
What does “trustee” mean?
Does that mean you’re allowed
to sell it if I don’t want
you to?
LEE
Because you’re a minor. You
can’t take it out alone. Yeah
 But I’m the trustee. I
gotta make the payments, keep
up with the inspections 
It means I’m in charge of
handling everything for you
until you turn eighteen 
I don’t know. But I’d
definitely consider it 
PATRICK
No fuckin’ way!
LEE
Don’t be so goddamn sure of
yourself! There’s nobody to run it!
You’re sixteen years old!
PATRICK
Yeah! I can get my licence this
year!
LEE
So what? You’re still a minor! You
can’t run a commercial vessel by
yourself!
PATRICK
Why can’t I run the boat with
George? 
LEE
Meanwhile it’s a big fuckin’
expense and I’m the one
that’s gonna have to manage
it and I’m not even gonna be
here!
PATRICK
Who gives a fuck where you are?
LEE
Patty, I swear to God I'm gonna
knock your fuckin’ block off!
MAN
Great parenting.
LEE
Mind your own fuckin’ business!
PATRICK
Uncle Lee!
LEE
Mind your own business! Shut
the fuck up or I’ll fuckin’
shut you up, I swear to God 
I'm gonnna smash you in the
fuckin’ face if you don't 
take a walk! Mind your 
fuckin’ business!
MAN
No no, that’s good parenting.
Smash him in the face. Smash
him in the face. That’ll show
him.
 PATRICK
It's OK, Mister. Thank you!
It's OK! Uncle LEE! Are you
fundamentally unsound? 
LEE
Get in the fuckin’ car!
PATRICK
I can’t obey your orders until you
unlock the door.
LEE
Just shut up.
GEORGE
It’s not like the motor’s gonna die
tomorrow, but Joe said it’s been
breakin’ down like a son of a bitch.
PATRICK
Yeah, but we were gonna take
a look this weekend 
LEE
See  There’s an allotment
of some kind  but things
are up in the air a little
bit, so 
GEORGE
No, I can take care of it as far as
general maintenance is concerned 
PATRICK
I’m takin’ care of it.
GEORGE
But that motor’s gonna go at
some point 
LEE
There’s no allotment for a new
motor. Unless you wanna buy it,
George 
PATRICK
Wait a second. I’m not sellin’ it 
LEE
Anyway, we’re gonna be in Boston.
PATRICK
What? Since when am I supposed to
be in Boston?
GEORGE
Well  Whatever you decide 
But it's gonna bleed you dry
just sittin’ here 
LEE
It’s not all worked out yet.
Just take it
easy! We don’t know what
we’re doin’ yet.
GEORGE
Well you know he can always stay
with us, if he wants to come up
weekends.
LEE
You wanna be his guardian?
PATRICK
He doesn’t wanna be my
guardian, for Christ’s
sakes ! They got five kids
already. Have you seen his
house?
GEORGE
Well  we already got a
houseful We’re tryin’ to
lose some kids at this
point 
LEE
No  we're just working out
logistics So, I didn't
know.
 PATRICK
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?
George. George. It’s OK.
Really. You don’t have to say
that. I know that.
GEORGE
Yeah, we're jammed in there
pretty good. But we've always
got a sofa for him any time
he wants. He knows that. Right?
He’s welcome any time 
PATRICK
Are you brain-damaged? You can't
just ask people that ! You don't
wanna be my guardian, that's fine
with me.
LEE
It's not that. It's just the
logistics. I just gotta work it
out. I swear.
PATRICK
How? By sendin’ me to Wonkatonka
Minnesota with Uncle Donny?
LEE
Minnetonka!
PATRICK
OK, Minnetonka. Minnetonka
Minnesota. Same difference!
LEE
Minnetonka Minnesota. Not 
Wonkatonka Minnesota.
PATRICK
What about my mother?
LEE
The judge wouldn't let her. Anyway,
no one knows where she is.
PATRICK
I do. She's in Connecticut. At
least she was last year.
LEE
Since when do you know that?
PATRICK
She emailed me last year. So I
emailed her back. You know, email?
LEE
Did your father know you were in
touch with her?
PATRICK
Are you kiddin’? Could we
walk? I'm freezin’.
They start walking again.
LEE
All I can tell you is 
PATRICK
I know, I know, she's a drunk,
she's insane, she let the dogs shit
on the floor.
LEE
 it’s the last thing your
dad ever woulda wanted.
PATRICK
Oh, like you suddenly care what he
woulda wanted?
LEE
Aw, fuck everything.
PATRICK
Where to now?
LEE
The funeral parlor.
PATRICK
Great.
PATRICK
Whoa, whoa, where’re we goin’?
LEE
It’s in Beverly.
PATRICK
There’s no funeral homes in
Manchester?
LEE
No. The cemetery's here 
PATRICK
Well, can you let me out? I'll just
walk home.
LEE
Let’s just get this done.
PATRICK
You wanna warn me if there's any
other Surprise Death Errands we
gotta run? Or is this gonna be it
for today?
LEE
Yes. Sorry. This is it.
PATRICK
What is with that guy and the big
Serious and Somber Act?
LEE
I don't know.
PATRICK
But seriously, does he not realize
that people know he does this every
single day?
LEE
I don't know. Who cares? I
think I parked the other way.
Sorry.
PATRICK
Why can't we bury him?
LEE
It's too cold. The ground’s too
hard. They’ll bury him in the
spring.
PATRICK
So what do they do with him til
then?
LEE
They put him in a freezer.
PATRICK
Are you serious?
LEE
Yeah. That's what they do with
them. They put ‘em in a big freezer
until the ground thaws out.
PATRICK
That really freaks me out.
LEE
It doesn’t matter. It isn't him.
It's just his body. Where’d I park
the car?
PATRICK
What about one of those mini-steam
shovels?
LEE
What?
PATRICK
I once saw one of those mini-steam
shovels one time in a graveyard in
New Haven. It dug a perfect little
hole in about two seconds.
LEE
I don’t really know how you would
get ahold of one. Or how much it
would cost 
PATRICK
Why can't we just look into it?
LEE
Anyway, I’m pretty sure you can’t
use heavy equipment in the Historic
Rosedale Cemetery.
PATRICK
Why not?
LEE
Because there’s a lot of important
people buried there, and their
descendants don’t want a steam
shovel vibratin’ over their dead
bodies. How do I know?
PATRICK
Why can't we bury him someplace
else?
LEE
That’s where he bought a plot.
Don’t ask me why. But if you wanna
find someplace else to bury him,
and find out how much it costs, and
change all the arrangements with
the mortician and the cemetery, and
call up Sacred Heart and talk to
Father Martin, and change the
arrangements for the funeral
service, be my guest. Otherwise
let's just leave it. OK?
PATRICK
I just don't like him bein’ in a
freezer.
LEE
Oh come on! Where’s the goddamn
car?
PATRICK
I don’t know, but I wish you’d
figure it out because I’m freezin’
my ass off.
LEE
Don’t you have a normal winter
coat?
PATRICK
Yes.
LEE
Why don’t you have gloves
with fingers on them?
PATRICK
Jesus Christ! 
LEE 
God damn it!
Oh where the fuck did I park the
fucking car?
God damn it’s cold!
PATRICK
Why? What’s the matter with your
winter jacket?
LEE
Seriously, Patty ?
It's on already!
It's all the way up! It takes
a minute to warm up, so just
relax, OK?
Just be quiet.
PATRICK
Just turn the heat on!
Well turn it up a little!
It’s blowin’ fuckin’ freezin’
air on me.
What year did you buy this
thing? 1928? Where’s the 
horse that goes with this 
fuckin’ car? Maybe he could 
breathe on us. 
LEE
Patty, I swear to God 
PATRICK
I know. Why don’t we just keep my
dad in here for the next three
months? We could save a fuckin’
fortune.
LEE
Would you shut up about that
freezer please? You want me to have
a nervous breakdown because there's
undertakers and a funeral?
 Who cares? 
PATRICK
No I don’t!
LEE
‘K, it’s gettin’ warmer.
PATRICK
I got band practice. Can you drive
me home so I can get my stuff and
then take me over to my
girlfriend’s house?
LEE
Sure.
This is the same girl as who was
over at the house?
PATRICK
No. That was Silvie. This is Sandy.
But they don't know about each
other. So please don't say anything
in case it comes up.
LEE
I won’t. Do you actually
have sex with these girls?
PATRICK
We don't just play computer games.
LEE
With both of them?
PATRICK
Well with Sandy's mom here it's
sort of strictly just basement
business.
LEE
What does that mean?
PATRICK
It means I'm workin' on it.
63.
SANDY
“I gotta RUN! I gotta RUN, I, I, I,
I, I, I, I gotta run ”
PATRICK
Stop. Stop. Otto man, what are you
doing?
OTTO
What did I do?
PATRICK
You're way behind, man.
OTTO
No, I'm not.
JOEL 
You're a little behind, Otto. 
CJ
Otto, you’re kind of draggin’
it  
PATRICK
You gotta stay with the bass.
JOEL
Come on man, just stay with me, all
right?
OTTO
All right, I'm sorry.
CJ
It's all right! You're alright.
Let’s just take it again. Otto, you
good?
OTTO
Yeah.
PATRICK
We are Stentorian.
JILL
Hi, are you Lee? I'm Jill. Sandy’s
mom. I think they’re wrapping up.
Do you wanna come inside and have a
beer or something?
LEE
Oh, that’s all right. Thank you.
JILL
I wanted to offer my condolences
about Joe. He was such a terrific
guy. There's not too many like him.
He was a wonderful father.
LEE
Thank you.
JILL
I was  I was gonna ask Patrick if
he wants to stay for supper, if
that's OK with you. You wanna join
us? I made way too much 
LEE
Oh. That’s all right. Thank you.

JILL
OK. You change your mind in the
next ten minutes, we’re right

LEE
OK. Thank you.
SANDY
Hold on  Hold on.
Just take your hand out.
PATRICK
Jesus Christ, I’m scrapin’
the skin off my knuckles. How
do you unbuckle this?
SANDY
Would you please take your hand
outta my cunt?
PATRICK
OK, OK!  Ow!
Sandy wriggles out of her jeans.
PATRICK 
Oh, are we taking our pants off?
SANDY
I'm takin' my pants off. I don't
know what you're doing.
PATRICK
I'm takin' my pants off 
Patrick tries to take off his pants, but one leg bunches up
at his ankle. He kicks to get it off. She tries to help him.
SANDY
Come on! You gotta take your shoe
off !
PATRICK
I’m tryin’!
JILL
Hey kids? Come on have some dinner!
PATRICK
OK, thanks Jill! We'll be
down in just one second.
I just gotta log off !
SANDY
Thanks, Mom! We’ll be right
down!
Would you shut up? She’s not
retarded.
PATRICK
Why are you pickin’ on me?
SANDY
I'm not pickin’ on you! You're
going to get me in trouble.
JILL
How’s the math homework?
PATRICK
Very frustratin’.
JILL
Good.
PATRICK
Those algorithms are a bitch 
PATRICK
Mm. This is really delicious, Jill.
JILL
Thank you, Patrick.
SANDY
Yeah, Mom, really good.
PATRICK
Is this a homemade carbonara sauce?
SANDY
Jesus, shut up.
JILL
Oh  no 
PATRICK
You could’ve fooled me.
SANDY
Jesus.
PATRICK
What?
SANDY
You're such a kiss-ass!
JILL
Sandy!
PATRICK
Why? Because I appreciate your
mother's cookin'?
PATRICK
Aren’t you gonna ask what
happpened?  Guess not.
LEE
I don’t want to know what 
happened.
Hello?
RANDI
Hello Lee? It’s Randi.
Hello? Lee?
Pause.
LEE
Yeah. I’m here. Sorry. How are you?
RANDI
I’m OK. How are you?
LEE
Good.
RANDI
I was callin’  George told me
about Joe. I just wanted to call
and say I’m sorry. I hope you don’t
mind me callin’.
LEE
No. Thank you. I don’t mind How
are you?
RANDI
Not so good, right now. I guess we
shoulda seen it comin’, but it’s
still kinda hard to believe 
LEE
Yeah 
RANDI
How’s Patrick doin’? Beyond the
obvious, obviously 
LEE
He’s OK. It’s hard to tell with
kids.
RANDI
Yeah 
Well, that’s good.
LEE
He doesn’t really open up
with me. I think he’s OK.
He’s got a lotta
friends So Yeah, it is 
RANDI
So, I don't know if you planned a
service yet, but I was also gonna
ask you if you wouldn't mind  I'd
like to be there, if it's OK with
you.
LEE
Of course you can 
RANDI
OK. Thank you. It would mean
a lot to me  OK  Thank
you.
LEE
That's fine. You should come.
I'll let you know when it's
gonna be.
RANDI
Thank you. So, can I ask 
How are you?
LEE
I don’t know. How are you?
RANDI
You know. We're doin’ pretty well.
I should probably tell you  I’m
gonna be  I’m pregnant. Actually.
LEE
Oh yeah?
RANDI
Yeah. Like  Ready to pop.
LEE
Oh, I didn't know that.
RANDI
I didn’t know if I should
tell you, but 
LEE
No, it’s fine. Congratulations.
RANDI
Thank you. You would probably
deduce it for yourself when you see
me.
LEE
Yeah.
Lee is unable to stay on the phone any longer.
RANDI
So, are you still 
LEE
Actually, sorry  I don’t
mean to cut you off. I just
gotta go pick up Patrick up
and I’m slightly late.
RANDI
That’s OK. I just wanted to make
sure it’s OK if me and Josh come to
the funeral.
LEE
It’s totally OK.
RANDI
OK. Thank you, Lee. God bless.
LEE
So long.
SILVIE
You OK, baby?
PATRICK
I’m OK.
GEORGE
So how you holdin’ up?
LEE
What’s the matter?
GEORGE
No 
LEE
What?
Um 
GEORGE 
 I said “How you holdin’
up?” It’s a stupid question.
You get some food?
LEE
I had some cheese.
GEORGE
“You had some cheese.” Asshole.
LEE
It’s OK, George.
GEORGE 
I’ll get you something. Hey
JANINE!
LEE
Seriously. I’m not hungry.
GEORGE

YoU’RE SAYIN’!
JANINE

PATRICK
Hey, is it OK if I ask Silvie to
stay over?
LEE
No.
PATRICK
What do you mean?
LEE
I don’t want her in the house right
now.
PATRICK
Why not? YOU don’t have to talk to
her 
LEE
I don’t like her. You can go to her
house or call one of your friends.
That’s it.
PATRICK 
Would your mom be cool if I came
there?   I have no idea.
Well, I can’t go there either.
LEE
Sorry about that.
PATRICK
So Are you gonna stay in here ?
LEE
Well  Yeah. Why not?
PATRICK
I thought maybe you’d want to stay
in Dad’s room.
LEE
Why? You want me to?
PATRICK
No. It’s just a better room. And
he’s not usin’ it 
LEE
I’ll stay in there. We’re not gonna
be here that much longer anyway.
PATRICK
I’m not movin’ to Boston, Uncle
Lee.
LEE
I don’t wanna talk about that right
now. OK?
PATRICK
You said he left you money so you
could move.
LEE
Yes. But that doesn’t mean I 
can just  
PATRICK
Anyway, what’s in Boston?
You’re a janitor.
LEE
So what?
PATRICK
You could do that anywhere. There’s
toilets and clogged-up drains all
over town.
LEE
I don’t wanna talk about it!
You can’t maintain it 
PATRICK
All my friends are here. I’m
on the hockey team. I’m on
the basketball team. I gotta
maintain our boat now. I work
on George’s boat two days a
week. I got two girlfriends
and I’m in a band. You’re a
janitor in Quincy. What the 
hell do you care where you
live?
PATRICK
Goodbye Uncle Lee!
JOE
Where you gonna be tonight?
LEE
I don’t know. A motel.
JOE
What time you gonna call me?
LEE
When I get to the motel.
JOE
If I don’t hear from you by nine
o’clock I’m gonna call the cops.
You understand?
LEE
Yes. Yes.
JOE
Patty! Come say goodbye to Uncle
Lee!
LEE
That’s OK.
JOE
It is not OK. Patrick! Come say
goodbye!
PATRICK
Comin’!
LEE
I’m gonna see him 
PATRICK
Goodbye Uncle Lee!
LEE
So long.
wiping his eyes.
PATRICK
I don’t want it. I don’t want it.
LEE
Patty 
PATRICK 
Somethin’s wrong with me.
LEE
What do you mean? Like what?
PATRICK
I don’t know! I feel really
weird! I’m havin’ like a
panic attack or something.
LEE 
Are you sick? 
What do you mean?
PATRICK
Could you get that shit outta the
freezer? I feel really weird.
LEE
Get ridda what? The chicken?
PATRICK
Yes. I don’t know.
I don’t know! No! 
LEE
Should I take you to the 
hospital? Do you want me to 
call your friends? 
You gonna go to bed?
PATRICK
Leave me alone.
LEE 
I don’t think I should let you keep
the door shut.
PATRICK
Just go away!
LEE
I will. Just open up the door.
PATRICK
Fuck you.
Jesus! What’s your problem?
No! No! No!
No! I’m just freakin’ out.
Just go away!
No we don’t ! 
LEE
I said open up the door. Are
you havin’ a breakdown?
Should I take you to the
hospital?
Fine, but I can’t let you
freak out with the door shut.
And if you’re gonna freak out
every time you see a frozen
chicken I think maybe we
should take you the hospital.
I don’t know anything about
this.
PATRICK
 I just don’t like him bein’ in
the freezer!
LEE
You’ve expressed that very clearly.
I don't like it either. But there’s
nothin’ we can do about it.
PATRICK
Just get out!
LEE
No.
PATRICK
I’m all right, OK? I just
wanna be alone.
LEE
I’m not gonna bother you.
I’m just gonna sit here. You 
can be alone as soon as you
calm down.
PATRICK
I’m calmer now. Would you please
get out?
LEE
No.
PATRICK
Cool!
JOE
How much are they payin’ you?
LEE
Minimum wage plus the room.
JOE
Let’s go get some furniture.
LEE
I got furniture.
JOE
No you don’t. This doesn’t count as
furniture. This is not a room.
Let’s go get some furniture.
LEE
Get off my back.
JOE
Patty, come on Let’s go.
JOE
You like that one?
LEE
I love it.
JOE
Good. Now you got an armchair.
Movin’ right along. Let’s go look
at lamps.
PATRICK
Uncle Lee, try this one!
JOE
Patty! Cut the crap. Let’s go get a
lamp.
LEE
I got a lamp.
JOE
You got a light bulb. Let’s go get
a lamp. Patty, come on.
JOE
Better? Better.
LEE
Listen. We can stay until
your school lets out. That’ll give
me time to set things up in Boston
better. You can do some stuff with
George in the summer if you want
 And you don’t get jerked out of
your life overnight.
PATRICK
Are you askin’ me or tellin’ me?
LEE
I’m tellin’ you it’s the best I can
do.
PATRICK
Then what the fuck do you care
whether it’s OK with me or not?
Pause.
LEE
It’s half an hour away! You can
come back here any time you want!
PATRICK
From Quincy?
What is that, a joke?
It’s an hour and a half at
least! You gotta include the 
other cars. 
You couldn’t get from here to
Quincy in half an hour if you 
flew in a fuckin’ spaceship!
LEE
Yes! No! Depending on the
traffic. Fifty minutes.
But we don’t have to stay
there! We could look in
Charlestown, or Everett 
OK, fuck it.
PATRICK
I need lunch money.
GIRL
Hi, Patrick! Hi, Patrick!
GIRL
Hi, Patrick!
GIRL
Hey Patrick  !
GIRL 
So are you goin’ to Godspell?
PATRICK
I’m thinkin’ about it.
GIRL
OK, ‘bye.
LEE
Are they your girlfriends too?
PATRICK
They wish.
LEE
Doesn’t George pay you a salary for
helpin’ with his boat?
PATRICK
Yeah, but I’m savin’ that.
LEE
For what?
PATRICK
New motor.
LEE
You goin’ to Godspell?
Come on !
Hello?
ELISE
Hello, is that Lee?
Hello? Lee? It’s Elise. 
Hello?
PATRICK
What happened to your hand?
LEE
I cut it.
PATRICK
Oh. For a minute there I didn’t
know what happened.
Is there some reason why you didn’t
tell me my mom tried to call me?
She wrote me you hung up on her.
She’s in Essex. She wants me to see
her new house and meet her fiancee.
What’d you think? She
couldn’t get in touch with me?
LEE
I hung up because I didn’t know
what to say to her. And I didn’t
tell you ‘cause I didn’t know what
to say to you. I’m sorry.
PATRICK
You can’t stop me talkin’ to her.
LEE
I don’t care what you do.
PATRICK
No, but you won’t let my girlfriend
come over and you hate my mother so
much you won’t even tell me that
she called. You’d rather drag me
back to Quincy and ruin my life
than somebody else be my guardian 
LEE
There is nobody else.
PATRICK
I can live in Essex with my mom.
LEE
No you can’t.
PATRICK
But if she's not an alcoholic
anymore and she wants me to stay
with her, then I can take the bus
to my same school and keep all my
friends, and the boat, and you can
go back to Boston, and you can
still  I don't know: Like, check
in on me, or whatever, if you want
to 
LEE
I can’t do that.
PATRICK
Why?
LEE
I'm sorry I hung up on her. I’ll
call her back, and if she sounds
semi-human to me, you can go have
lunch with her and her fiancee if
you want. I don’t wanna talk about
this anymore.
GEORGE
OK! Soon as we get clear, open it
up and we’ll see what we can do.
PATRICK
OK!
JERRY
Hey  Lee ! Well, what do you
know?
LEE
How you doin’, Jerry?
JERRY
Not bad, not too bad. I was sorry
to hear about Joe.
LEE
Yeah. Thank you.
JERRY
How’s Patrick doin’?
LEE
Good.
JERRY
Good. So what’s goin’ on?
LEE 
 You know, I’m back and 
thinking about staying 
through the summer and was 
wondering if you had any 
work? If I could pick up some 
hours. 
JERRY
You oughta  Sure, sure.
Walter is down in Boston. He 
should be back tomorrow if 
you want to come by or Give 
him a call. 
LEE
 Anyway, I’m just lookin’
for anything right now 
Fixit jobs: Boats, engines, 
OK: I’ll do that. No, I know.
I just thought I’d ask.
JERRY
You oughta  Sure, sure. You
oughta come by tomorrow and
talk to Walter I doubt he’s
got anything in February 
Oh, absolutely.
LEE
Thanks Jerry.
JERRY
Good to see you.
Guess who just 
SUE
I don’t wanna see him in here
again.
GEORGE
So long ! Patty, I’ll see
you Wednesday? So long, Lee!
JANINE
So long !
PATRICK
„Bye guys! Yeah, Wednesday!
G’bye!
LEE
How’s the motor?
PATRICK
George says the piston’s gonna go
right through the block any minute
now.
LEE
Unfortunately that’s a problem. We
can’t afford to keep the boat if we
can’t hire somebody to work it, and
we can’t get anyone to work it, if
it’s got a broken motor.
PATRICK
Let’s take out a loan.
LEE
And pay it back with what?
PATRICK
We hire it out til we pay the loan
back, obviously.
LEE
Unfortunately for you, I’m
responsible for your finances until
you’re twenty-one, and I’m not
comfortable takin’ out enormous
loans on your behalf right now.
PATRICK
I have band practice. Can you drive
me home to get my stuff and then
drive me to Sandy’s house?
LEE
Why don’t you sign up for driver’s
ed?
PATRICK 
Because Dad made me promise 
not to drive til I was 
seventeen. 
LEE
I’m not your chauffeur. 
OK. Then we’ll stick with that.
PATRICK
You wanna stay for dinner? I think
Sandy’s mother likes you.
LEE
No she doesn’t.
PATRICK
Yes she does. This could be good
for both of us.
LEE
I’d really rather not.
PATRICK
Well, can you at least hang out
with her so I can be alone with
Sandy for half an hour without her
mother knockin’ on the door every
twenty seconds?
LEE
Come on, man.
PATRICK
All you gotta do is talk to
her! Why can’t you help me
out a little bit for once
instead of draggin’ me to the
lawyers and the funeral
parlor and the morgue? Anyway
she’s really nice!
LEE
Ok.
PATRICK
Thank you.
SANDY
"Tell me why  Why do you need me?
Why do you want me? / Why do you
love me?"
PATRICK
Stop. Stop.
PATRICK
Otto, man 
OTTO
What? I'm too slow?
CJ
Too fast.
OTTO
I'm too fast?
JOEL
Dude, you're like pullin’ outta the
fuckin’ station ahead of me.
SANDY
Oh my God, you guys! Leave him
alone.
CJ
Are you serious about this band or
what?
OTTO
Get off my back.
CJ
All right, everybody just chill
here. Let's just go again.
PATRICK
We are Stentorian.
JILL
Patrick’s one of my favorite
people.
LEE
That’s good.
JILL
How’s it goin’ up there, you guys?
SANDY
It’s going fine! Thanks! But
we’re right in the middle of
something!
PATRICK
Good! Really good! We’re
totally rippin’ through those
compound fractions!
JILL
At least we know where they are,
right?
LEE
That’s true 
PATRICK
Hold on a sec.
SANDY
How many of those you generally
gotta go through before you pick a
winner?
PATRICK
I’d like to see you use one of
these goddamn things with all these
interruptions  Ow!
SANDY
What happened? Are you OK?
PATRICK
I tripped over your fuckin’ doll
house.
SANDY
Oh my God, did you break it?
PATRICK
I don’t know. I’m fine though, by
the way.
SANDY
Oh my God. My grandmother gave me
that when I was five years old. It
was literally her doll house from
when she was a little girl.
PATRICK
Well what’s it doin’ on the fuckin’
floor?
SANDY
It’s a doll house! That’s where you
play with it!
JILL
Sandy? What is going on up there?
SANDY
Nothing! Patrick stubbed his toe on
Mummer’s doll house, but it’s OK!
JILL
Sandy, that doll house belonged to
my mother!
SANDY 
Yes I know, Mom! It was just
an accident. Nobody’s
smashin’ it to pieces! It’s
fine!
JILL 
If you’re gonna smash it to
pieces I wish you’d let me
keep it somewhere else!
 PATRICK
Don’t worry, Jill, I’m OK! My
toe’s gonna be OK!
JILL
Could I get you another beer, Lee?
LEE
I’m good. Thanks.
JILL
Would you excuse me, Lee, one sec?
LEE
Sure.
SANDY
Is it on?
PATRICK
Yes. It’s a miracle.
SANDY
OK. Hurry up.
JILL
Hey, Sandy? I’m sorry !
 PATRICK
Goddamn it!
SANDY 
One second please!  Get outta my way!
SANDY
What’s up?
JILL
I’m really sorry, I know you’re
trying to work, but I can’t sit
down there much longer.
SANDY
Why? What’s the problem?
JILL
He won’t talk. I’ve been trying to
make conversation for half an hour!
SANDY
Are you serious?
JILL
I realize I’m not the most
fascinating person in the
world, but it’s very, very
strained.
PATRICK
What’s the matter?
 SANDY
Mom 
SANDY
She can't make your Uncle speak.
PATRICK
He likes sports.
JILL
I'm sorry to bust things up,
but how much longer do you
think you're gonna be?
I'm sorry !
SANDY 
Sports? 
 PATRICK 
Can you talk about sports?
Maybe there’s a game on you
could watch.
 SANDY 
Shut up. Mummy, Please.
PATRICK
You were a tremendous help.
LEE
I didn’t ask to sit down there.
PATRICK
You can't make small talk like
every other grown up in the world?
You can't talk about boring 
bullshit for half an hour? 
“Hey, how about those 
interest rates?” Hey, I lost 
my Triple A card?” Like 
everybody else? 
LEE 
No. 
Nope. Sorry. 
PATRICK
You're a fuckin' asshole.
LEE
Where did she say she lives?
Because there are like no houses
here. None. Does she live in a
fuckin' sleeping bag?
PATRICK
119 Pigeon Hill Street.
LEE 
Pigeon Hill Street? Or Pigeon 
Hill Road? Pigeon Hill Court? 
PATRICK  
Pigeon Hill Street. Street! 
This is Pigeon Hill Road. 
PATRICK
You have no GPS whatsoever?
LEE
No, I've got a little fuckin'
cartoon moving map.
PATRICK
Do you want me to punch it in for
you?
LEE
No, I don't. I've got it. Thank
you. Okay, listen. Are you
nervous?
PATRICK
Yeah I’m nervous.
PATRICK 
What are you, a fuckin’
genius?
LEE
Because 
Skip it.
LEE 
Just If anything gets weird, just
text me, and I’ll come and get you.
PATRICK
OK.  Thank you.

You know we're Christian too, 
right? You are aware that 
Catholics are Christians? 
PATRICK 
Yes, I know that. 
Yes I am aware of that. 
They drive in gloomy silence.

Wow.

Wow what?
PATRICK
You’ll do anything to get
ridda me!
LEE
What?
PATRICK
You heard me.
LEE
That’s not true.
JEFFREY
“Dear Patrick, I’m writing on to
thank you for today. Your visit
meant the world to your mom. We are
both deeply grateful for the love
and trust you’ve shown by offering
to rejoin her life.
But I feel it would be unfair to
your mom to rush her along the long
and challenging road ahead, and so
I’m going to ask you to write to me
in future to arrange any further
visits. I hope you won’t find this
to be ”
PATRICK
I don’t know.
LEE
Why don’t you call that girl Sandy
and see if she’ll come over?
PATRICK
No thanks. Nice try, though.
PATRICK
Who are you gonna shoot? You or me?
LEE
Do you know how much these guns are
worth?
PATRICK
A lot, I think.
LEE
Want to try to sell them and put
the money toward a new second hand
motor for the boat?
PATRICK
That’s a really good idea.
PATRICK
This is awesome.
SANDY
This is awesome!
PATRICK
You wanna drive?
SANDY
Sure!
PATRICK
OK  So 
Yeah  Don’t  Just

LEE
I just burnt the sauce!
Everything’s OK!
LEE
I got a job in Boston. It starts in
July.
PATRICK
What is it?
LEE
Custodian, handyman But just two
buildings this time.
PATRICK
And what delightful Boston
neighborhood have you selected for
us to live in?
LEE
None.
PATRICK
What do you mean?
LEE
You don’t have to move to Boston.
I’m gonna be in Charlestown and
George is gonna take you.
PATRICK
What?
LEE
Yeah. I talked to them last week.
I explained the situation to them.
Georgie Junior’s goin’ to school
this fall. Jimmy graduates next
year. We’ll have to rent out this
house. You can move back in when
you turn eighteen. When you turn
twenty-one, you’re allowed to sell
it or stay in it, or whatever you
want. Definitely have to hire the
boat out when the summer’s over 
just like we talked about. I
thought when you get your license,
we can figure that one out as we
go. I'm still the trustee, but all
the financial stuff Joe set up for
me is gonna get transferred over to
George.
So everything’ll be the same,
except you don’t have to move.
PATRICK
But like, are they gonna be my
guardians? Or do you still 
LEE
They’re gonna adopt you
Anyway, that's how I set it up. If
you want. It's up to you.
PATRICK
So are you gonna just
disappear?
LEE
You don’t have to do it. No.
No. I just set it up so you
can stay here. They’re really
glad to have you. They love
you.
PATRICK
I know. I mean, they’re great But
why can’t you stay?
LEE
Come on, Patty I can’t beat it.
I can’t beat it. I’m sorry.
HOMEOWNER
What do you think?
LEE
I think you’re gonna be OK.
HOMEOWNER
Are you one of Stan Chandler’s
boys?
LEE
Yeah, I’m Lee.
HOMEOWNER
I used to play a little chess with
your father a long time ago. He was
a heck of a chess player.
LEE
That's him.
HOMEOWNER
He's not still living, is he?
LEE
No.
HOMEOWNER
And one of the sons passed away
recently I heard.
LEE
Yeah. Joe. My brother.
HOMEOWNER
That's right. Very personable man.
LEE
Yeah.
HOMEOWNER
My father passed away in 1959. A
young man. Worked on a tuna boat.
Went out one morning, little bit of
weather, nothing dramatic And he
never returned. No signal. No
Mayday. No one ever knew what
happened.
PATRICK
I’m gonna get some ice cream.
LEE
Go ahead.
PATRICK
Can I have some money?
LEE
Yeah.
PATRICK
So When am I supposed to move in
with Georgie?
LEE
July. I don’t even have a place to
live yet.
PATRICK
Don’t they give you an apartment?
LEE
Yeah, but I was gonna try to get a
place with an extra room. Or room
for like a pullout sofa.
PATRICK
What for?
LEE
In case you wanna visit sometime.
Or if you’re lookin’ at colleges in
Boston or somethin’ and you wanna
stay overnight 
PATRICK
I’m not goin’ to college.
LEE
All right, well then I'll have an
extra room for all my shit. Do we
have to talk about this now?
PATRICK
Nope.
Great throw.
LEE
Just let it go.
