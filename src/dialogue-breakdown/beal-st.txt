	YOUNG MAN
	You ready for this?
	YOUNG WOMAN
	Yes.
	Ain’t nothin’ else in the world I’m
	more ready for.
	TISH
	Alonzo...
	TISH
	Alonzo... we’re going to have a
	baby.
	TISH
	I’m glad Fonny, I’m glad.
	Don’t you worry.
	FONNY
	You sure?
	TISH
	No. I ain’t sure, I’m just trying
	to mess with your mind.
	FONNY
	What we goin’ to do?
	TISH
	Well... we ain’t goin’ to drown it.
	So I guess we’ll have to raise it.
	FONNY
	Did you tell my daddy?
	TISH
	Not yet.
	FONNY
	You tell your folks?
	TISH
	Not yet. But don’t worry about
	them, I just wanted to tell you
	first.
	FONNY
	Well, I guess that makes sense. My
	daddy and ‘nem can’t keep nothin’
	to theyselves, better this way.
	A baby.
	FONNY
	What you gonna do?
	TISH
	I’m going to do just like I been
	doing. I’ll work up to just about
	the last month. And then, Mama and
	Sis will take care for me, you
	ain’t got to worry. And anyway, we
	have you out of here before then.
	FONNY
	You sure about that?
	TISH
	Of course I’m sure.
	I’m always sure about that.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	How you doin’ Lil’ Bit?
	SHARON
	How is he?
	TISH
	He’s just the same. He’s fine. He
	sends his love.
	SHARON
	Good. You see the lawyer?
	TISH
	Not today. I have to go on Monday,
	after work.
	SHARON
	He been to see Fonny?
	TISH
	No.
	TISH
	Mama...?
	SHARON
	Yeah, Lil’ Bit?
	That same hand on Tish’s shoulder now:
	SHARON
	Tish, I don’t think you got nothing
	to cry about.
	You tell Fonny?
	TISH
	I just told him today. I figured I
	should tell him first.
	SHARON
	You did right. And I bet he just
	grinned all over his face.
	TISH
	Yes.
	He sure did.
	SHARON
	You must be - let’s see - you about
	three months gone?
	TISH
	Almost.
	SHARON
	What you cryin’ about?
	SHARON
	Now listen, you got enough on your
	mind without worrying about being a
	bad girl and all that jive-ass
	shit. I sure hope I raised you
	better than that.
	If you was a bad girl you wouldn’t
	be sitting on this bed, you’d long
	been turning tricks for the warden.
	SHARON
	Now you and Fonny be together right
	now, married or not, wasn't for
	that damn white man. So, let me
	tell you what you got to do. You
	got to hold on to that baby, don't
	care what else happens or don't
	happen. You got to do that, ‘cause
	we gonna get Fonny out. And that
	baby be the best thing that ever
	happened to him. It’s going to give
	him a whole lot of courage.
	You hear me?
	TISH
	Yes, Mama.
	SHARON
	Now, when your Daddy and Ernestine
	get home, we going to sit at the
	table together, and I'll make the
	family announcement. I think that
	might be easier, don't you?
	TISH
	Yes.
	SHARON
	Take off them streets clothes and
	lie down for a minute. I'll come
	get you.
	TISH
	Mama?
	TISH
	Thank you.
	SHARON
	I don’t know what you thanking me
	for. This a family, ain’t it?
	SHARON (O.S.)
	Be right there!
	SHARON
	Here.
	Drink this.
	MAN (O.S.)
	Forgot my keys, Tish home yet?
	SHARON
	Shhhh, she's taking a little nap.
	JOSEPH
	She see Fonny?
	SHARON
	Yeah. She saw him. She saw the
	inside of the Tombs, too. That's
	why I made her lie down.
	JOSEPH
	What about the lawyer?
	SHARON
	She going to see him Monday.
	JOSEPH
	How much you think them damn
	lawyers is going to cost us before
	this thing over?
	SHARON
	Joe, you know damn well ain't no
	point in asking me that question.
	JOSEPH
	Well. They sure got it made, the
	rotten motherfuckers.
	SHARON
	Amen to that.
	ERNESTINE
	Where's Tish?
	SHARON
	She's home. She's lying down.
	ERNESTINE
	She all right?
	SHARON
	She's tired. She went to see Fonny.
	ERNESTINE
	How's he taking it?
	SHARON
	Taking it.
	 10.
	 11.
	ERNESTINE
	Lord, let me make myself a drink.
	You want me to cook?
	SHARON
	No. I'll get into the pots in a
	minute.
	ERNESTINE
	She see Hayward?
	SHARON
	No. She's seeing him on Monday,
	after work.
	ERNESTINE
	You going with her?
	SHARON
	I think I better.
	ERNESTINE
	Yeah. I think so, too, I'll call
	him from work, before you all get
	there.
	JOSEPH
	You know... Tish says she thinks
	that lawyer wants more money.
	ERNESTINE
	Daddy, we paid him his retainer,
	that's why ain't none of us got no
	clothes. And I know we got to pay
	expenses, but he ain't supposed to
	get no more money until he brings
	Fonny to trial.
	SHARON
	He says it's a tough case.
	JOSEPH
	Shit. What's a lawyer for?
	SHARON
	To make money.
	JOSEPH
	You got that right.
	ERNESTINE
	Well. Anybody talk to the Hunts
	lately?
	SHARON
	They don't want to know nothing
	about it, you know that. Mrs. Hunt
	and them two camellias is just in
	disgrace. And poor Frank ain't got
	bail no money.
	ERNESTINE
	Well. Let's not talk too much about
	it in front of Tish. We'll work it
	out somehow.
	JOSEPH
	Shit. We got to work it out.
	Fonny's like one of us.
	SHARON
	He is one of us.
	ERNESTINE
	Well hello there, baby sister.
	SHARON
	You want a lil’ snack, baby?
	TISH
	No thank you, I’m okay.
	SHARON
	Well alright then, if y’all want to
	eat, better get your behinds out of
	my kitchen, this food ain’t gon’
	fix itself. Come on now, take your
	business into the living room.
	SHARON
	Do I come down to your job and
	watch you work?
	Sing to me Nina, sing.
	JOSEPH
	What you doin’ with that?
	SHARON
	What you think? Get the good
	glasses.
	SHARON
	You the man of the house, start
	pouring.
	JOSEPH
	But of course, Madame.
	SHARON
	Just a lil’ bit for Tish, now.
	JOSEPH
	Alright, what’s the deal?
	SHARON
	This... is a sacrament. And no, I
	ain’t gone crazy. We’re drinking to
	a new life.
	Tish is gonna have Fonny’s baby.
	SHARON
	Drink.
	JOSEPH
	That's a hell of a note.
	JOSEPH
	Ain't you going to drink to the
	little one, Tish?
	JOSEPH
	How long this been going on?
	SHARON
	About three months.
	ERNESTINE
	Yeah. That's what I figured.
	JOSEPH
	Three months!?
	TISH
	Since September.
	JOSEPH
	While you two was running around
	looking at places?
	JOSEPH
	You sure you want this baby?
	TISH
	Yes, and Fonny wants it too. It's
	our baby, don't you see? And it's
	not his fault that he’s in jail,
	it’s not like he ran away.
	(pleading)
	And we've always been best friends,
	ever since we were little, you know
	that. And we'd be married now,
	if–if–-
	SHARON
	Your father know that.
	He's only worried about you.
	JOSEPH
	Don't you go thinking I think you a
	bad girl, or any foolishness like
	that. I just asked you that because
	you so young, that's all, and--
	ERNESTINE
	Un-bow your head sister.
	SHARON
	To the newborn.
	JOSEPH
	I hope it’s a boy, that’d tickle
	old Frank to pieces, I bet.
	Tish, do you mind... if I break the
	news to him?
	TISH
	No daddy, I don’t mind.
	ERNESTINE
	I sure would like to be the one to
	tell them sisters.
	SHARON
	Joe, why don't you just call up and
	ask them all over here? Hell, it's
	Saturday night and it ain't late
	and we still got a lot of brandy in
	the bottle. And now that I think
	about it, it's really the best way
	to do it, call they asses on over
	here, Joe.
	JOSEPH
	You know you right love, let’s get
	them over here.
	JOSEPH
	Mrs. Hunt... is getting dressed.
	Come on over here, daughter.
	JOSEPH
	You’re a good girl, Tish.
	I’m proud of you.
	Don’t you forget that.
	ERNESTINE
	She ain’t going to forget it.
	I’ll whoop her ass if she do.
	SHARON
	But she’s pregnant!
	ERNESTINE
	Shall we dress for Mrs. Hunt?
	JOSEPH
	Look. We got to be nice, okay?
	ERNESTINE
	Oh we’ll be nice; Lord knows we’ll
	be nice, you raised us right. It’s
	just you didn’t never buy us no
	clothes. But Mrs. Hunt and them
	sisters, they got wardrobes. Ain’t
	no sense in trying to compete with
	them.
	JOSEPH
	I didn’t run no tailor shop.
	ERNESTINE
	Well who’s fault is that?
	FONNY
	I’ve slept in this park sometimes.
	No, it’s not a good idea.
	TISH
	No thank you.
	Why did you sleep in the park?
	FONNY
	It was late. Didn’t want to go
	home. Didn’t want to wake up none
	of you neither.
	FONNY
	But I got me a pad down here now.
	I’ll show it to you, you want to
	see it?
	TISH
	I’d like that.
	FONNY
	You all right?
	TISH
	Yeah.
	FONNY
	Good.
	You want to eat down here or you
	want to wait till we get back
	uptown? Or you want to go to the
	movies or you want a little wine or
	you want a little pot or a beer or
	a cup of coffee?
	Or you just want to walk a little
	more before you make up your mind?
	ERNESTINE
	Alice, how do you do, only way to
	get to see you people is to call an
	emergency summit, now you know that
	ain’t right?
	FRANK
	So you saw my big-headed boy today?
	TISH
	Yes. He’s fine. He sends his love.
	FRANK
	They ain’t giving him too hard a
	time, is they? I ask you like that
	because, you know, he might say
	things to you he won’t say to me.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Lovers’ secrets.
	TISH
	Well. He hates it, you can see
	that. And he should. But he’s
	strong. He’ll be alright... but
	we’ve got to get him out of there.
	SHEILA
	If he’d done his reading and his
	studying when he should have, he
	wouldn’t be in there.
	FRANK
	What you know about it you--
	JOSEPH
	You bring that six-pack man?
	JOSEPH
	Or I got some gin and we got
	whiskey and we got some brandy.
	Ain’t got no Thunderbird though--
	I’m sure you ladies won’t mind?
	MRS. HUNT
	Mind? Frank does not care if we
	mind.
	SHARON
	Mrs. Hunt, what can I get you,
	sugar? I can offer you some tea, or
	coffee; and we got ice cream, and
	Coca Cola.
	ERNESTINE
	Yeah Mrs. Hunt, I can make you an
	ice-cream soda. Come on Sheila, you
	want to help me?
	Sit down Mama, me and Sheila got
	it.
	SHARON
	Lord, the time sure flies. We ain’t
	hardly seen each other since this
	trouble started.
	MRS. HUNT
	Don't say a word. I have been
	running myself sick, all up and
	down the Bronx, trying to get the
	very best legal advice I can find.
	I just pray and pray and pray that
	the Lord will bring my boy to the
	light. That's all I pray for, every
	day and every night.
	MRS. HUNT
	And then, sometimes I think that
	maybe this is the Lord's way of
	making my boy think on his sins and
	surrender his soul to Jesus.
	SHARON
	You might be right. The Lord sure
	works in mysterious ways.
	MRS. HUNT
	Oh yes. Now he may try you. But he
	ain’t never left none of His
	children alone.
	SHARON
	What you think of the lawyer
	Ernestine found, this boy Hayward?
	MRS. HUNT
	I haven’t seen him yet.
	I just have not had time to get
	downtown. But I know Frank saw him--
	SHARON
	What you think Frank?
	FRANK
	It’s a white boy who’s been to law
	school and he got them degrees. I
	ain’t got to tell you what that
	mean: it don’t mean shit.
	MRS. HUNT
	You’re talking to a woman.
	FRANK
	I’m hip, and it’s a mighty welcome
	change.
	Like I was saying, it don’t mean
	shit and I ain’t sure we’re going
	to stay with him. On the other
	hand, as white boys go, he’s not so
	bad: he’s young and hungry, so he’s
	not as full of shit now as he may
	be when he’s full.
	MRS. HUNT
	But I keep trying to tell you, that
	it's that negative attitude, you're
	so full of hate. If you give people
	hatred, they will give it back to
	you. Every time I hear you talk
	this way my heart breaks for my
	son, sitting in a dungeon which
	only the love of God can bring him
	out of.
	SHARON
	He's not talking hatred, Alice.
	He's just telling the truth.
	MRS. HUNT
	I trust in God, I know He cares for
	me.
	ADRIENNE
	Mr. Rivers, exactly what is the
	purpose of this meeting? You
	haven't called us all the way over
	here just to watch my father insult
	my mother?
	TISH
	Why not? It's Saturday night. You
	can't tell what people won't do if
	they get bored enough.
	Maybe we just invited you over to
	liven things up?
	ADRIENNE
	I can believe that you're that
	malicious... but I can't believe
	you’re that stupid.
	FONNY
	Pedrocito, que pasa? ¿Podemos tener
	algún servicio, por favor?
	PEDROCITO
	“Servicio, servicio.”
	Senorita, how may I help you, I’m
	sorry your company tonight is less
	than desirable but this can’t be
	helped.
	FONNY
	No se puede evitar, mi culo.
	PEDROCITO
	Oye, estás con una mujer,
	encantadora!
	PEDROCITO
	A very good night Señorita! You are
	always welcome here.
	FONNY
	Tish....
	TISH
	Yes?
	FONNY
	Come and see my place, won’t you?
	TISH
	But... it’s late.
	FONNY
	It ain’t far.
	TISH
	Okay, Fonny.
	Okay.
	ERNESTINE
	Happy landings.
	TISH
	I called this meeting. I had Daddy
	ask you all to come over so I could
	tell you what I had to tell Fonny
	this afternoon.
	TISH
	What I had to tell Fonny this
	afternoon is... that Fonny’s going
	to be a father.
	We’re going to have a baby.
	FRANK
	You and me? We fixin’ to go out and
	get drunk.
	FRANK
	I’m glad. Don’t you worry, I’m
	mighty--
	MRS. HUNT
	And who is going to be responsible
	for this baby?
	TISH
	The father and the mother.
	FRANK
	You can bet that it won’t be the
	Holy damn Ghost.
	MRS. HUNT
	I guess you call your lustful
	action love. I don’t. I always knew
	you’d be the destruction of my son.
	The Bible says: “Put to death
	therefore what is earthly in you:
	sexual immorality, impurity,
	passion, evil desire and
	covetousness.”
	That child is borne of sin, the
	Holy Ghost will cause it to shrivel
	in your womb. But my son will be
	forgiven. My prayers will--
	ADRIENNE
	Her heart!
	FRANK
	I think you’ll find it’s still
	pumping. But I wouldn’t call it no
	heart.
	FRANK
	Joe, let the women take care of her
	and come on with me.
	FRANK
	Please man, come on.
	SHARON
	Go on with him, Joe.
	Go on.
	SHARON
	Go on. We don’t need you here.
	TISH
	That was a terrible thing you said
	to me. It was the most terrible
	thing I’ve heard in all my life.
	ADRIENNE
	My father didn’t have to slap her.
	SHEILA
	She’s got a weak heart.
	SHARON
	She’s got a weak head, the Holy
	Ghost done softened y’all brain,
	child: did she forget it was
	Frank's grandchild she was cursing?
	I know some men would have cut that
	weak heart out of your body and
	gladly gone to hell to pay for it.
	SHEILA
	I don’t think you have the right to
	sneer at my mother’s faith.
	ERNESTINE
	Oh don’t give me that bullshit, you
	so shamed you got a Holy Roller for
	a mother, you don’t know what to
	do. Y’all make me sick.
	ADRIENNE
	You make me sick. Maybe my mother
	didn’t say it exactly like she
	should have, but he didn’t have to--
	TISH
	My father doesn’t hit my mother.
	SHARON
	Baby your mother a lot smarter than
	hers.
	ADRIENNE
	And who do you funky niggers think
	you are? She only asked one
	question: ‘Who’s going to raise
	this baby?’ And who is? Tish ain’t
	got no education and God knows she
	ain’t got nothin’ else. And Fonny
	ain’t never been worth a damn, so
	who is going to take care of this
	baby?
	TISH
	I am, you dried up yellow cunt, and
	you keep on talking, I’m going to
	take mighty good care of you.
	ERNESTINE
	Adrienne? Baby? May I tell you
	something, Sweetie-pie?
	ERNESTINE
	Oh, sugar. From the very first day
	I laid eyes on your fine person, I
	got hung up on your Adam's apple. I
	been dreaming about it; it's
	delicious.
	I just can't tell, Sweetie, if I
	want to tear it out with my
	fingers... or my teeth. It is a
	thing of beauty. And if you touch
	my sister, I'm going to have to
	make up my mind pretty quick, so...
	ERNESTINE
	...touch her. Go on, please.
	SHEILA
	I knew we shouldn't have come.
	ERNESTINE
	My. I must have a dirty mind,
	Sheila. I didn’t know that you
	could even say that word.
	SHARON
	Ernestine.
	ADRIENNE
	Come on Sheila, let’s go.
	MRS. HUNT
	I sure hope...
	...that you’re pleased with the way
	you raised your daughters.
	MRS. HUNT
	My girls won’t be bringing me no
	bastards to feed, I can guarantee
	you that.
	ERNESTINE
	That’s because won’t nobody fuck
	‘em.
	SHARON
	Ernestine.
	SHARON
	But the child that’s coming... is
	your grandchild. I don’t understand
	you, it’s your grandchild. What
	difference does it make how it gets
	here? The child ain’t got nothing
	to do with that; don’t none of us
	have nothing to do with that.
	MRS. HUNT
	That child....
	MRS. HUNT
	That child....
	FONNY
	I be damned, there’s a rose in
	Spanish Harlem.
	FONNY
	Next week, I’m going to get you a
	rose for your hair.
	FONNY
	We’re grown up now.
	FONNY
	And you’ve always been mine, no?
	FONNY
	And you know... that I’ve always
	been yours, right?
	TISH
	I never thought about it that way.
	FONNY
	Think about it now.
	TISH
	I just....
	TISH
	I just know that I love you.
	FONNY
	I love you too... but I try not to
	cry about it.
	FONNY
	I want you to marry me.
	That’s right. I’m yours and you’re
	mine and that’s it.
	FONNY
	Now, I’ve got to try to explain
	something to you.
	FONNY
	This is where my life is, my real
	life.
	FONNY
	This might turn out all right one
	day, it might not. I don't know a
	thing about it yet.
	FONNY
	Now, listen, I ain't the kind of
	joker going to give you a hard time
	running around after other chicks
	and shit like that. I smoke a
	little pot but I ain't never popped
	no needles and I'm really just a
	square, but....
	FONNY
	I live with wood and stone. I got
	stone in the basement and I'm
	working in here all the time and
	now I'm looking for a loft where I
	can really work. So, all I'm trying
	to tell you is... I ain't offering
	you much.
	I ain't got no money and I work at
	odd jobs just for bread because I
	ain't about to go for none of their
	jive-ass shit. And that means that
	you going to have to work, too. And
	when you come home most likely I'll
	just grunt and keep on with my
	chisels and maybe sometimes you'll
	think I don't even know you're
	there. But don't ever think that,
	not ever. You're with me all the
	time -- without you, I don't know
	if I could make it at all. And when
	I put down the chisel, I'll always
	come to you. I'll always come to
	you, ‘cause I need you, understand?
	Is that all right?
	TISH
	Yes. Of course it’s alright.
	I love you.
	FONNY
	Now don’t be scared.
	Don’t be scared. Just remember that
	I belong to you. Just remember that
	I wouldn’t hurt you for nothing in
	this world. You just going to have
	to get used to me. And we got all
	the time in the world
	FONNY
	Hold onto me.
	FONNY
	I’m sorry to have made such a mess.
	But I guess you don’t want to have
	no baby right away and I didn’t
	have no protection.
	TISH
	I think I made a mess too. Isn’t
	there supposed to be blood?
	(a flash of shyness)
	It was my first time. Did you know?
	FONNY
	I had a hemorrhage. Should we look?
	TISH
	I don’t mind.
	Why are we whispering?
	FONNY
	It’s what people do when they
	screw.
	TISH
	I like lying here like this.
	FONNY
	I do too. Do you like me?
	I mean – when I make love to you –
	do you like it?
	TISH
	You just want to hear me say it.
	FONNY
	That's true.
	So....
	TISH
	So what?
	FONNY
	So why don't you go ahead and say
	it?
	TISH
	Well... it was a little bit like
	being hit by a truck...
	...but it was the most beautiful
	thing that ever happened to me.
	FONNY
	Yeah.
	For me, too.
	FONNY
	I’ll see you in.
	ERNESTINE
	You’re just in time for coffee.
	TISH
	We was--
	FONNY
	Good morning, Miss Rivers,
	I’m sorry we comin’ in so
	late. Can I speak to Mr.
	Rivers, please? It’s
	important.
	ERNESTINE
	It might be easier to see him if
	you come inside out that hall.
	TISH
	Sis, we--
	FONNY
	--want to get married.
	ERNESTINE
	Then you better have some coffee,
	come on in here.
	SHARON (O.S.)
	Now where have you two been ‘till
	this hour of the morning?
	SHARON
	Don’t you know better than to be
	behaving like that? I declare, we
	was just about to call the police.
	FONNY
	I’m sorry Mrs. Rivers, it’s all my
	fault.
	FONNY
	I hadn’t seen Tish for a few weeks
	and we had a lot to talk about; I
	had a lot to talk about, I kept her
	out.
	SHARON
	Talking?
	FONNY
	We....
	FONNY
	We... want to get married.
	That’s how come I kept her out so
	late. I love Tish. That’s why I
	stayed away so long. I even....
	...I even went to see other girls
	and, I did all kinds of things, to
	kind of get it out of my mind.
	(checks Tish: still down)
	But I could see I was just fooling
	myself. I didn’t love nobody else
	but her. And then I got scared that
	maybe she’d go away or somebody
	else would come along and take her
	away and so I came back.
	I came runnin’ back. And I don’t
	have to go away again. She’s always
	been my girl, Mrs. Rivers -- you
	know that. And... I’m not a bad
	boy. You know that. And you’re...
	you’re the only family I’ve ever
	had.
	SHARON
	Now see, that’s why I can’t figure
	out why you callin’ me Mrs. Rivers
	all of a sudden.
	I hope you realize, Miss, that you
	ain’t but eighteen years old.
	ERNESTINE
	That argument and a subway token
	will get you from here to the
	corner.
	SHARON
	What do you think about all this?
	ERNESTINE
	Me? I’m delighted to be rid of the
	little brat. I never could see what
	all the rest of you saw in her, I
	swear. Take some sugar Fonny,
	you’re going to need it if you
	intend to tie yourself up with my
	sweet little sister.
	SHARON
	Joe! Come on out here, lightning’s
	done struck the poorhouse! Come on
	now, I mean it!
	JOSEPH
	I’d like you to tell me exactly
	what you mean young lady by walking
	in here this hour of the morning.
	If you want to leave home, then you
	leave home, you hear? But as long
	as you in my house, you got to
	respect it. You hear me?
	FONNY
	Mr. Rivers, please don't scold her.
	It's all my fault, sir.
	I kept her out. I had to talk to
	her. I asked her to marry me.
	That's what we were doing out so
	long. We want to get married.
	That's why I'm here. You're her
	father. You love her. And so I know
	you know – you have to know – that
	I love her. I've loved her all my
	life. You know that. And if I
	didn't love her, I wouldn't be
	standing in this room now – would
	I? I could have left her on the
	stoop and run away again. I know
	you might want to beat me up. But I
	love her. That's all I can tell
	you.
	JOSEPH
	How old are you?
	FONNY
	I’m twenty-one, sir.
	JOSEPH
	You think that’s old enough to get
	married?
	FONNY
	I don’t know sir, but it’s old
	enough to know who you love.
	JOSEPH
	You think so?
	FONNY
	I know so.
	JOSEPH
	How you going to feed her?
	FONNY
	How did you?
	JOSEPH
	You got a job?
	FONNY
	I load moving vans in the daytime
	and I sculpt at night. I'm a
	sculptor. We know it won't be easy.
	JOSEPH
	Now, let me get this straight. You
	asked my little girl to marry you,
	and she said–-
	FONNY
	Yes.
	JOSEPH
	And you come here to tell me or to
	ask my permission?
	FONNY
	Both, sir.
	JOSEPH
	What would you do in my place?
	FONNY
	I'd ask my daughter. If she tells
	you she don't love me, I'll go away
	and I won't never bother you no
	more.
	JOSEPH
	You love him, Tish?
	TISH
	Yes.
	HAYWARD
	Well, as you know, this is a very
	difficult case.
	TISH
	That's why my sister hired you.
	HAYWARD
	And you’re beginning to think that
	her confidence was misplaced?
	TISH
	No.
	I wouldn't say that.
	SHARON
	We miss him, that’s all. This is...
	it’s getting to us.
	HAYWARD
	I can certainly understand that,
	and I'm doing all I can to get him
	back to you just as fast as I can.
	But Mrs. Rogers’ refusal to
	reconsider her testimony has left
	us in a very tough place.
	And now she’s disappeared.
	TISH
	Disappeared? But...
	SHARON
	How can she just disappear?
	HAYWARD
	This is a very big city, a very big
	country, for that matter -- people
	disappear. I don't think she’s gone
	very far, they certainly don’t have
	the means for that. But her family
	may have returned her to Puerto
	Rico. In any case, in order to find
	her, I’ll need special
	investigators, and–-
	SHARON
	That means money.
	HAYWARD
	Unfortunately....
	TISH
	That filthy bitch.
	SHARON
	How much money?
	HAYWARD
	I’m trying to keep it as low as
	possible, but... special
	investigators are... special.
	And they know it.
	SHARON
	Puerto Rico?
	HAYWARD
	We don't know for sure, but it’s a
	strong possibility. Anyway, she and
	her new man disappeared some days
	ago from the apartment on Orchard
	Street.
	TISH
	But doesn't it make it look bad for
	her story, to just disappear like
	that? She's the key witness.
	 45.
	 46.
	HAYWARD
	Yes. But she’s... ‘a distraught,
	ignorant, Puerto Rican woman,
	suffering from the aftereffects of
	rape. So her behavior is not
	incomprehensible.’
	You see what I mean?
	HAYWARD
	And she’s only one of the key
	witnesses in this case. You have to
	remember this Officer Bell; his was
	the authoritative identification of
	the rapist. It’s Bell who swears he
	saw Alonzo running away from the
	scene of the crime. And I have
	always been of the opinion — we
	discussed this when your sister
	first brought me on — that it’s his
	testimony which Mrs. Rogers
	continually repeats–-
	TISH
	If he saw Fonny at the scene of the
	crime, then why did he have to wait
	and come and get him out of the
	house?
	SHARON
	Tish.
	You mean — let me get you straight
	now — that it's that Officer Bell
	who tells her what to say?
	HAYWARD
	Exactly.
	TISH
	You're saying--
	SHARON
	That there's no way of getting at
	the truth in this case?
	HAYWARD
	If I didn't believe in Alonzo's
	innocence, I would never have taken
	the case.
	TISH
	Call him Fonny.
	HAYWARD
	Excuse me?
	TISH
	Call him Fonny. When you call him
	Alonzo, I see the judge and bars
	and chains. I know you’re doing my
	sister a favor and this is a very
	fancy law office, but... if you’re
	doing this, you’ve gotta be family,
	call him Fonny, please.
	HAYWARD
	I understand.
	Now, you and Fonny insist that you
	were together, in the room on Bank
	Street with an old friend, Daniel
	Carty, that’s the alibi. Your
	testimony, as you can imagine,
	counts for nothing, and Daniel
	Carty has just been arrested by the
	DA's office and I’ve not been
	allowed to see him, they’re holding
	him incommunicado.
	HAYWARD
	What they’re doing is really
	against the law, but... Daniel has
	a record. They obviously intend to
	make him change his testimony. And,
	I do not know this, but I’m willing
	to bet that that’s why Mrs. Rogers
	has disappeared. So. You see. I’ll
	do the best I can, but... the
	situation is bleak.
	SHARON
	How soon do you need the money?
	HAYWARD
	We’re already tracing Mrs. Rogers.
	I’ll need the money as soon as you
	can get it. I’ll also force the
	DA's office to allow me to see
	Daniel Carty, but...
	they’ll throw every conceivable
	obstacle in my way.
	SHARON
	So... we're trying... to buy time.
	HAYWARD
	In a word... yes.
	FONNY
	The fuck we going to do about Mrs.
	Rogers? Where the fuck did she go?
	TISH
	I don't know. But we'll find her.
	FONNY
	How you going to find her?
	TISH
	We're sending people to Puerto
	Rico. We think that's where she
	went.
	FONNY
	And suppose she went to Argentina?
	Or Chile? Or China?
	TISH
	How's she going to get that far?
	FONNY
	They can give her the money to go
	anywhere!
	TISH
	Who?
	FONNY
	The DA's office, that's who!
	TISH
	Fonny–-
	FONNY
	You don't believe me? You don't
	think they can do it?
	TISH
	I don't think they have.
	FONNY
	How you going to get the money to
	find her?
	TISH
	We're all working, all of us.
	FONNY
	Yeah. My Daddy's working in the
	garment center, you're working in a
	department store, your Daddy's
	working on the waterfront--
	TISH
	Fonny, listen–-
	FONNY
	Listen to what? What we going to do
	about that fucking lawyer? He don't
	give a shit about me, he don't give
	a shit about nobody! You want me to
	die in here? You know what's going
	on in here? You know what's
	happening to me? To me in here?
	FONNY
	I'm sorry, baby. I don't mean none
	of that for you. I'm sorry. I love
	you. You know that, I'm sorry.
	TISH
	I do. And I understand what you
	goin’ through, I’m with you baby.
	FONNY
	How's the baby coming?
	TISH
	It's growing. I'll start showing
	more next month.
	FONNY
	Get me out of here, baby. Get me
	out of here, please.
	TISH
	I promise, baby, I promise.
	FONNY
	I'm sorry I yelled. I wasn't
	yelling at you.
	TISH
	I know.
	FONNY
	Please don't cry. Please don't
	cry... it's bad for the baby.
	Make they skin all wrinkled, come
	out lookin’ like a old man, be
	givin’ birth to a baby Red Foxx.
	FONNY
	That’s right, give us a smile.
	TISH
	Is that all right?
	FONNY
	You can do better than that.
	TISH
	Is this better?
	FONNY
	Yeah, you nut, give us a kiss.
	FONNY
	You still love me?
	TISH
	I'll always love you.
	FONNY
	I love you, baby. I miss you. I
	miss everything about you, I miss
	everything we had together,
	everything we did together, walking
	and talking and making love; baby,
	get me out of here.
	TISH
	I will. Hold on.
	FONNY
	I promise. You take care of
	yourself out there.
	TISH
	I will Fonny, you know I will.
	DANIEL
	Wow! What's happenin’?
	FONNY
	Why you asking me, man?
	DANIEL
	Because, like the man says about
	Mt. Everest: ‘You're there.’
	FONNY
	Come on. We got some beer at the
	pad. You remember Tish?
	DANIEL
	Skinny little Tish?
	FONNY
	Yeah. She's still my girl. We going
	to get married, man. Come on and
	let me show you the pad. And she'll
	fix us something to eat, I told you
	we got beer at the house.
	DANIEL
	So, you really going to get
	married?
	FONNY
	Well, yeah, we looking for a place
	to live; we looking for a loft
	because that don't cost no whole
	lot of bread, you know, and that
	way I can work without Tish being
	bugged to death. This room ain't
	big enough for one, ain't no
	question about its being big enough
	for two, and I got all my work here
	and in the basement.
	FONNY
	They got lofts standing empty all
	over the East Side, man, and don't
	nobody want to rent them, except
	freaks like me. And they all fire
	traps and some of them ain't even
	got no toilets. So, you figure like
	finding a loft ain't going to be no
	sweat.
	FONNY
	But man, this country really do not
	like niggers. They do not like
	niggers so bad, man, they will rent
	to a leper before they’ll rent to a
	nigger, I swear.
	FONNY
	Sometimes Tish and I go together,
	sometimes she goes alone, sometimes
	I go alone. But it's always the
	same story, man. And now I can't
	let her go alone no more because,
	dig, last week we thought we had us
	a loft, the cat had promised it to
	her. But he had not seen me. And he
	figures a black chick by herself,
	way downtown looking for a loft,
	well, he know he going to make it
	with her.
	He thinks she's propositioning him,
	that's what he really thinks. And
	she comes to tell me — just so
	proud and happy — and we go on over
	there. And when the cat sees me, he
	says there's been some great
	misunderstanding, he can't rent the
	loft because he's got all these
	relatives coming in from Rumania
	like in half an hour and he got to
	give it to them. Shit. And I told
	him he was full of shit and he
	threatened to call the cops on my
	ass.
	FONNY
	I'm really going to have to try to
	figure out some way of getting some
	bread together and getting out of
	this fucking country.
	DANIEL
	How you going to do that?
	FONNY
	I don't know yet.
	Tish can't swim.
	DANIEL
	Maybe you could go first.
	FONNY
	Nah.
	I don't think I want to do that.
	I'd be too scared.
	DANIEL
	Scared of what?
	FONNY
	Just scared.
	DANIEL
	Scared of what might happen to
	Tish?
	FONNY
	Yeah.
	Scared of what might happen to both
	of us – without each other. Like
	Tish ain't got no sense at all,
	man, she trusts everybody. She walk
	down the street, swinging that
	little behind of hers, and she's
	surprised, man, when some cat tries
	to jump her. She don't see the
	world like everybody see it.
	FONNY
	I know I might seem to be a weird
	kind of cat. But I got two things
	in my life, man – I got my
	sculpting and I got Tish. If I lose
	them, I'm lost. I know that. You
	know, whatever's in me I didn't put
	there. And I can't take it out.
	DANIEL
	I don't know if you so weird. I
	know you lucky. I ain't got nothing
	like that. Can I have another beer,
	man?
	FONNY
	Hell yeah you can.
	DANIEL
	I just come out the slammer, baby.
	Two years. They said — they still
	say — I stole a car.
	I mean I had a little pot on me
	when they grabbed me but man, I
	can't even drive a car.
	DANIEL
	But, then, it sounded a whole lot
	better than that marijuana charge.
	DANIEL
	Two God damn years.
	FONNY
	By the balls.
	DANIEL
	Yeah.
	By the balls.
	FONNY (O.S.)
	You need some help in there?
	TISH
	No thank you, I’m fine.
	Y’all good?
	FONNY
	How long you been out?
	DANIEL
	About three months.
	Man, it was bad. Very bad. And it's
	bad now.
	Maybe I'd feel different if I had
	done something and got caught. But
	I didn't do nothing. They were just
	playing with me, man, because they
	could. And I'm lucky it was only
	two years, you dig? Because they
	can do with you whatever they want.
	Whatever they want. And they dogs,
	man. I really found out, in the
	slammer, what Malcolm and them cats
	was talking about. The white man's
	got to be the devil. He sure ain't
	a man. Some of the things I saw...
	I'll be dreaming about until the
	day I die.
	FONNY
	That’s alright, man. You out now,
	it's over, you young.
	DANIEL
	Man, I know what you're saying. And
	I appreciate it. But you don't
	know, the worst thing, man, the
	worst thing, is that they can make
	you so fucking scared. Just...
	scared, man.
	TISH
	You cats hungry?
	FONNY (O.S.)
	Yeah, we starvin’. Move it!
	DANIEL
	It's nice to see you, Tish. You
	sure ain't gained no weight, have
	you?
	DANIEL (CONT'D)
	 57.
	 58.
	TISH
	You hush. I'm skinny because I'm
	poor.
	DANIEL
	Well, I sure don't know why you
	didn't pick yourself a rich
	husband. You ain't never going to
	gain no weight now.
	TISH
	Well, if you skinny, Daniel, you
	can move faster and when you in a
	tight place, you got a better
	chance of getting out of it. You
	see what I mean?
	DANIEL
	You sound like you got it all
	figured out. You learn all that
	from Fonny?
	Maybe she can't gain no weight, but
	you sure will. You folks mind if I
	drop by more often?
	FONNY
	Feel free.
	Tish ain't very good looking, but
	she can sure get the pots together.
	TISH
	I'm happy to know I have some use.
	SHARON
	I know I can't help you very much
	right now – God knows what I
	wouldn't give if I could. But I
	know about suffering.
	And I know that it ends. I ain't
	going to tell you no lies, like it
	always ends for the better.
	Sometimes it ends for the worse.
	You can suffer so bad that you can
	be driven to a place where you
	can't ever suffer again. And that's
	the worst. That’s so much worse
	than any suffering.
	SHARON
	Try to remember that.
	I know a lot of our men have died
	in prison: but not all of them. You
	remember that. And you ain't really
	alone in that bed. You got that
	child beneath your heart and we're
	all counting on you, Fonny's
	counting on you, to bring that
	child here safe and well. You the
	only one who can do it. But you one
	of us. Which mean you made of tough
	stuff. You understand?
	TISH
	Yes, Mama.
	SHARON
	Are you all right now? Can you
	sleep?
	TISH
	Yes.
	SHARON
	I don't want to sound foolish. But
	remember, love brought you here. If
	you trusted love this far, don't
	panic now, trust it all the way.
	ERNESTINE
	Hey, Jezebel.
	ERNESTINE
	You smell like a Louisiana whore.
	ERNESTINE
	Well don’t you smell nice.
	ERNESTINE
	You want the good news or the bad
	news first?
	TISH
	Bad news.
	ERNESTINE
	See that’s how you know we family.
	Bad news is, they found Mrs.
	Rogers, she’s in Puerto Rico.
	Somebody’s gonna have to go there
	to talk to her.
	TISH
	Which we’ll have to pay for.
	TISH
	Okay, what’s the good news?
	ERNESTINE
	That... they found her, I guess?
	TISH
	How she get to Puerto Rico?
	TISH
	I can’t go to Puerto Rico.
	TISH
	So Hayward?
	ERNESTINE
	Hayward's got to deal with Bell and
	the DA. Anyway, you can see that,
	for many, many reasons, Hayward
	can't go. He'd be accused of
	intimidating a witness.
	TISH
	But that's what they're doing–-
	ERNESTINE
	It would take us until your baby is
	voting age to prove that.
	Look, mama and daddy don't know, I
	haven't talked to them yet, wanted
	to talk to you first.
	TISH
	Do you think she really was raped?
	ERNESTINE
	Tish... I don't know what's going
	on in that ingrown mind of yours,
	but that question don’t mean a
	thing. As far as our situation is
	concerned baby, she was raped.
	That's it.
	ERNESTINE
	I think, in fact, that she was
	raped and that she has absolutely
	no idea who did it, would probably
	not even recognize him if he passed
	her on the street. I may sound
	crazy, but the mind works that way.
	She'd recognize him if he raped her
	again. But then it would no longer
	be rape, if you see what I mean?
	TISH
	I see what you mean. But why Fonny?
	ERNESTINE
	Because he was presented to her as
	the rapist and it was much easier
	to say yes than to try and relive
	the whole damn thing. This way,
	it's over for her.
	TISH
	And for us, too?
	ERNESTINE
	No. Not even.
	It won't ever be over for us.
	TISH
	What about Puerto Rico?
	ERNESTINE
	That's one of the reasons I wanted
	to talk to you. Before we talk to
	Mama and Daddy. Look. You can't go,
	no way you can. For one thing,
	without you, Fonny will panic. I
	don't see how I can go, I've got to
	keep lighting firecrackers under
	Hayward's ass. Daddy can't go, and
	God knows Frank can't go. That
	leaves Mama.
	TISH
	Mama?
	TISH
	She don't want to go to Puerto
	Rico.
	ERNESTINE
	And she hates planes. But she wants
	your baby's father out of jail.
	She'll go.
	TISH
	And what do you think she can do?
	ERNESTINE
	She can do something no special
	investigator can do: she may be
	able to break through to Mrs.
	Rogers. Maybe not, but if she can,
	we're ahead. And if not, well, we
	haven't lost anything, and at least
	we'll know we've tried.
	TISH
	And what about Daniel? Daniel can
	vouch for us, Daniel knows Fonny
	was with him.
	ERNESTINE
	I told you. Hayward is seeing him
	tomorrow. He may have been able to
	see him today.
	TISH
	Some shit.
	ERNESTINE
	Yeah.
	But we in it now.
	FRANK
	What we going to do?
	JOSEPH
	Well, the first thing we got to do
	is to stop blaming ourselves. If we
	can't do that, man, we'll never get
	the boy out because we'll be so
	fucked up. And we cannot fuck up
	now, baby, and I know you hear
	where I'm coming from.
	FRANK
	I hear that but man, what we going
	to do about the money?
	JOSEPH
	You ever have any money?
	JOSEPH
	You ever have any money?
	FRANK
	No.
	JOSEPH
	Then why you worried about it now?
	JOSEPH
	You raised them somehow. You fed
	them somehow, didn't you? If we
	start to worrying about money now,
	man, we going to be fucked and we
	going to lose our children. That
	white man, baby, he want you to be
	worried about the money. That's his
	whole game.
	But if we got to where we are
	without money, we can get further.
	I ain't worried about they money -–
	they ain't got no right to it
	anyhow, they stole it from us -–
	they ain't never met nobody they
	didn't lie to and steal from. Well,
	I can steal, too. And rob. How you
	think I raised my daughters? Shit.
	FRANK
	What you think is going to happen?
	JOSEPH
	What we make happen.
	FRANK
	That’s easy to say.
	JOSEPH
	Not if you mean it.
	FRANK
	I guess... I love Fonny more than I
	love anybody in this world. And it
	makes me ashamed, man, I swear,
	because he was a real manly little
	boy, wasn't scared of nothing,
	except maybe his Mama. He didn't
	understand his Mama. And I don't
	know what I should’ve done. I ain't
	a woman. And there's some things
	only a woman can do with a child.
	FRANK
	I don't know if I was ever any kind
	of father to him — any kind of real
	father — and now he's in jail and
	it ain't his fault and I don't even
	know how I'm going to get him out.
	I'm sure one hell of a man.
	JOSEPH
	Well, he sure think you are. He
	loves you, and he respects you;
	now you got to remember that I
	might know that better than you.
	Tell you something else: your son
	is the father of my daughter's
	baby. Now, how you going to sit
	here and act like can't nothing be
	done? We got a child on the way
	here, man. You want me to beat the
	shit out of you?
	JOSEPH
	Now I know some hustles and you
	know some hustles and these are our
	children and we got to set them
	free. So, let's drink up man and go
	on in. We got a whole lot of shit
	to deal with in a hurry.
	RESTROOM ATTENDANT
	Have a good day, sir.
	LEVY
	So... you read the ad, right?
	LEVY
	Okay lady and gentleman, here we
	are.
	LEVY
	I know it’s not much to look at but
	we’re not done with it, see... you
	gotta imagine there’s walls like
	over here...
	And here, see?
	FONNY
	Yeah Tish, it’s not done, they
	still workin’ on it.
	TISH
	Fonny...
	I’m sorry, but... how we gonna make
	a home outta this?
	FONNY
	With love baby, I know we can.
	Look here....
	FONNY
	Imagine we got walls here and here,
	running all the way to the back,
	right?
	FONNY
	See, it won’t be all this, we’ll
	have our own space, it’ll be us
	here and maybe some other young
	folks over there and there, like a
	community, right?
	LEVY
	Yeah, a community.
	TISH
	But... where we supposed to cook
	and sleep and bath, I mean... where
	my mama and ‘nem gonna sit?
	FONNY
	Easy, we’ll put a couch over here--
	FONNY
	--and the bed? We’ll put the bed
	right back here so I can see you in
	that pretty light when the sun
	rises.
	FONNY
	And eatin’? Well, I think we should
	have the dining table over here--
	--and really the only thing left is
	the fridge but, I ain’t tryna throw
	out my back before we even had time
	to make a kid so Levy, help me with
	this fridge man.
	FONNY
	1... 2... 3.
	FONNY
	I tell you what it was a load
	getting up those stairs, but what a
	man won’t do for love, eh Levy?
	LEVY
	Amen, brother.
	TISH
	You’re quite crazy, you know that?
	FONNY
	Why yes, my dear, I do.
	TISH
	But also...
	Quite cute.
	LEVY
	Don't worry about the neighbors.
	After five or six o'clock, you
	won't have any. All you got down
	here is sweatshops; place on the
	ground floor is legit.
	Common decency requires I tell you
	that, the stairwell we came in on?
	Allows access to the building
	interior, not the sidewalk, so...
	in case of a fire...
	FONNY
	...our best bet is to come on up,
	hop to another building or ride it
	out up here?
	FONNY
	Other than it being a firetrap,
	what’s the catch?
	LEVY
	What’s that?
	FONNY
	No offense Levy, but we been
	lookin’ a long time. Don’t seem to
	me like it’s a reason for you to
	treat two Negros so nice like,
	clearly we ain’t got a pot nor much
	of a drink to make piss with;
	pardon my French.
	LEVY
	Look, with me, it’s simple: I dig
	people who love each other. Black,
	white, green or purple, doesn’t
	matter to me, just spread love, you
	know?
	FONNY
	So you a hippie? I didn’t take you
	for no hippie.
	LEVY
	Nah, I’m just my mother’s son.
	Sometimes that’s all what makes the
	difference between us and them.
	LEVY
	Keep in touch about getting that
	deposit together, you hear?
	FONNY
	Will do, Levy.
	Will do.
	FONNY
	You ready for this?
	TISH
	Yes.
	Ain’t nothin’ else in the world I’m
	more ready for.
	TISH
	I’m gonna grab some things for
	dinner.
	FONNY
	I’m’a grab me some smokes across
	the street.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	I can sure dig a tomato who digs
	tomatoes.
	ITALIAN PUNK
	Hey, sweet tomato. You know I dig
	tomatoes.
	TISH
	That man there attacked me. Right
	in this store. Right now. Everybody saw it.
	OFFICER BELL
	And where were you, while all
	this...
	OFFICER BELL
	...while all this was going on
	between junior there and your girl?
	TISH
	He was around the corner, buying
	cigarettes.
	OFFICER BELL
	Is that so, boy?
	TISH
	He's not a boy, Officer.
	OFFICER BELL
	You live around here?
	FONNY
	Yes, on Bank Street.
	OFFICER BELL
	We're going to take you down, for
	assault and battery.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Oh no you’re not.
	ITALIAN LADY
	I know both these young people.
	They shop here very often. What the
	young lady has told you is the
	truth. I saw them both when they
	came. I was busy, I could not get
	to her right away; her tomatoes are
	still on the scale. And that little
	good-for-nothing over there
	attacked her. What would you do if
	a man attacked your wife? If you
	have one.
	ITALIAN LADY
	I saw exactly what happened. I am a
	witness. And I will swear to it.
	OFFICER BELL
	Funny way to run a business.
	ITALIAN LADY
	You will not tell me how to run my
	business. I was on this street
	before you got here and I will be
	here long after you are gone.
	OFFICER BELL
	Well...
	...be seeing you around.
	FONNY
	You may...
	...and then again, you may not.
	FONNY
	Tish...
	TISH
	Yes?
	FONNY
	Don't ever try to protect me.
	TISH
	But you were trying to protect me.
	FONNY
	It's not...
	...the same...
	...thing.
	FONNY
	Don't think I don't know you love
	me. You believe we going to make
	it?
	FONNY
	Don't say a word. I'm going to take
	you out to dinner. At our Spanish
	place, you remember?
	FONNY
	We have no money, but we are very
	hungry. And I will have some money
	in a couple of days.
	PEDROCITO
	In a couple of days, that is what
	they all say. And, furthermore, I
	suppose that you would like to eat
	sitting down!
	FONNY
	Why, yes, if you could arrange it,
	that would be nice.
	PEDROCITO
	And now, no doubt, you would like
	two margaritas?
	FONNY
	Caught me again.
	FONNY
	Tish.
	Oh Tish.
	TISH
	Goddammit!
	Be patient. I'm doing the best I
	can. Please.
	FONNY
	Here she come! Big as two houses!
	FONNY
	You sure it ain’t twins? Or
	triplets?
	Shit, we might make history.
	TISH
	Your daddy figure hisself a
	comedian.
	FONNY
	You look good baby.
	TISH
	Thank you, honey.
	FONNY
	Better than anybody over here,
	don’t care how big you get.
	TISH
	Well as soon as that ain’t the
	truth somethin’ wrong, you tell me
	'cause I’m outta here then.
	TISH
	How you doin’, husband?
	FONNY
	I’m good, wife.
	You here now. I’m all good now.
	You know I love you.
	TISH
	You know I love you.
	TISH
	No matter what happen with all of
	this sh--
	TISH
	I’m alright.
	FONNY
	Tish.
	TISH
	I’m okay.
	TISH
	I’m okay.
	I’m fine.
	TISH
	You alright?
	FONNY
	Me? I’m not the one just got
	punched by a midget inside they
	belly.
	SHARON
	Do you speak English?
	SHARON
	I’m sorry but I don’t speak any
	Spanish and I’ve had to come here
	unexpectedly. And I don’t drive,
	you see?
	SHARON
	You see?
	AIRPORT STAFFER
	One moment Señora.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Señora...
	AIRPORT STAFFER
	This is Jaime, your driver, he will
	take you to your hotel, tell him.
	JAIME
	It will be my pleasure, Señora.
	JAIME
	It is okay, Señora. You are safe
	with me.
	SHARON
	Thank you for waiting.
	JAIME
	Of course, Señora.
	SERVER
	Your drink Señorita.
	SHARON
	Thank you.
	SHARON
	Excuse me.
	SERVER
	Yes, Señorita?
	SHARON
	Well... I’m supposed to meet a
	friend here, but the flight I meant
	to take was overbooked, so I was
	forced to take an earlier one, I’m
	not sure he’s here yet.
	SERVER
	Who is your friend?
	SHARON
	It’s actually more the nature of
	business. I’m waiting for Señor
	Alvarez; Pietro Alvarez. I’m Mrs.
	Rivers. From New York.
	SERVER
	Yes, Señorita. I will tell Señor
	Alvarez.
	MAN (O.S.)
	You Mrs. Rivers?
	You waiting for me?
	SHARON
	Pietro? Pietro Alvarez?
	PIETRO
	Maybe. What you want to see him
	about?
	SHARON
	I don’t especially want to see Mr.
	Alvarez. I want to see Victoria
	Rogers. I’m the mother-in-law of
	the man she’s accused of rape.
	PIETRO
	Well lady, you got one hell of a
	son-in-law, let me tell you that.
	SHARON
	I also have one hell of a daughter,
	let me tell you that.
	PIETRO
	Look, she’s been through enough;
	more than enough. Leave her alone.
	SHARON
	A man is about to die for something
	he didn’t do, can we leave him
	alone.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Another drink, Señor Alvarez?
	PIETRO
	It’s on me, give the lady what she
	wants. And give me the usual.
	SHARON
	Do you believe I love my daughter?
	PIETRO
	Frankly lady, it’s hard to believe
	you got a daughter.
	SHARON
	Do you think I would marry my
	daughter to a rapist?
	PIETRO
	You might not know.
	SHARON
	Son, listen: I know that she was
	raped, and I know... I know what
	women know. But I also know that
	Alonzo did not rape her.
	PIETRO
	Why you comin’ to me? Shit, I ain’t
	nothin’: Indian, wop, spic, spade,
	that’s me baby. I got my little
	thing here and I got Victoria and
	lady, I don’t want to put her
	through no more shit, I’m sorry.
	SHARON
	No, please.
	SHARON
	Look at them.
	Look at them.
	SHARON
	Take this photo home; take it to
	Victoria. Take it and you ask her,
	you show it to her and you ask her,
	ask her to study it. Hold her in
	your arms; do that. I’m a woman, I
	know what women know, I know that
	she was raped. But I also know, I
	know that Alonzo did not rape her.
	JAIME
	I think it might be here. You say
	she is blond, yes?
	SHARON
	Mrs. Rogers?
	VICTORIA
	No, Señora. You are mistaken. I am
	Sanchez.
	VICTORIA
	Excuse me, Señora, but I have work
	to do. I don't know any Mrs.
	Rogers. Maybe in one of the other
	places around here?
	SHARON
	I have a photograph of you.
	VICTORIA
	Señora, I have my work to do. What
	do you want with me? I don’t know
	you.
	SHARON
	I know you don't know me. Maybe you
	never even heard of me.
	VICTORIA
	Do you smoke?
	SHARON
	I know you don't know me. But you
	must have heard of me.
	VICTORIA
	Look. I ain't got nothing against
	nobody. But I got to ask you to get
	out of here.
	SHARON
	I'm here to try to get a man out of
	prison. That man is going to marry
	my daughter. And he did not rape
	you.
	SHARON
	Look at this.
	SHARON
	Look at it, please. This is my
	daughter. The man with her is
	Alonzo Hunt. Is this the man who
	raped you?
	SHARON
	Is this the man who raped you?
	VICTORIA
	It looks like him.
	But he wasn't laughing when he was
	raping me.
	SHARON
	May I sit down?
	VICTORIA
	Look, lady, before you go any
	further, just let me tell you, you
	can't do nothing to me, I ain't
	alone here, I got people.
	SHARON
	I'm not trying to do anything to
	you. I'm just trying to get a man
	out of jail. An innocent man.
	VICTORIA
	Lady, I think you in the wrong
	place. Ain't no reason to talk to
	me. Ain't nothing I can do.
	SHARON
	How long were you in New York?
	VICTORIA
	Too long.
	SHARON
	Did you leave your children there?
	VICTORIA
	Listen. Leave my children out of
	this.
	SHARON
	Why did you come back here?
	SHARON
	Daughter... in this world, terrible
	things happen to you, and we can
	all do some terrible things.
	SHARON
	I was a woman before you was a
	woman — remember that. And I know,
	I know, you pay for the lies you
	tell.
	SHARON
	You've put a man in jail, a man
	you've never seen. He's twenty-two
	years old, he wants to marry my
	daughter.
	VICTORIA
	I did see him.
	SHARON
	You saw him in the police lineup.
	That's the first time you saw him,
	the only time.
	VICTORIA
	What makes you so sure?
	SHARON
	Because I've known him all his
	life.
	VICTORIA
	One thing I can tell, lady: you
	ain't never been raped.
	VICTORIA
	They took me down there and they
	asked me to pick him out and that’s
	what I did, I picked him out.
	SHARON
	But you were... it happened in the
	dark. You saw Alonzo in the lights.
	VICTORIA
	There's lights in the hallway, I
	saw enough.
	SHARON
	Daughter... in the name of God.
	VICTORIA
	Get out of here! Get out!
	FONNY
	You all right?
	TISH
	Yes. I'm all right.
	FONNY
	The baby all right?
	TISH
	Yes. The baby's fine.
	TISH
	We got to get some meat on your
	bones, Lord, have mercy.
	FONNY
	Speak up. He can't hear you.
	TISH
	But listen... there’s something I
	gotta tell you.
	TISH
	Mama came back from Puerto Rico.
	She found Victoria, but... the girl
	went crazy, they don’t know where
	she is now.
	TISH
	So the trial might get postponed.
	TISH
	Fonny...
	FONNY
	I’m fine.
	TISH
	Hayward’s not charging us no more,
	we almost got the money to bail you
	out.
	FONNY
	I figured you would.
	FONNY
	Listen, I'll be out soon.
	FONNY
	I'm coming home because I'm glad I
	came, can you dig that?
	FONNY
	See now? I'm an artisan. Like a cat
	who makes tables. I don't like the
	word artist. Maybe I never did. I
	sure the fuck don't know what it
	means. I'm a cat who works from his
	gut, with his hands. I know what
	it's about now. I think I really
	do. Even if I go under. But I don't
	think I will now. I know I won’t.
	He’s far from her. Here with her, yes. But very far away.
	FONNY
	Baby, I love you. And I'm going to
	build us a great big table and our
	family gonna be eatin’ off it for a
	long, long time to come.
	And I'm all right, too. Don't you
	worry. I'm coming home. I'm coming
	home, to you. I want you in my
	arms. I want your arms around me.
	I've got to hold our baby in my
	arms. It's got to be. You keep the
	faith.
	FONNY
	Don't you worry. I'll be home.
	OFFICER BELL
	Can I carry that for you?
	TISH
	No.
	No thank you.
	OFFICER BELL
	Well, you ain't got far to go. Sure
	wish I could carry it for you,
	though.
	OFFICER BELL
	I ain't a bad guy. You ain't got to
	be afraid of me.
	TISH
	I'm not afraid.
	OFFICER BELL
	FONNY (V.O.)
	I want to be in your arms...
	FONNY (V.O.)
	I want to hold you in my arms.
	FONNY (V.O.)
	I’ve gotta hold our baby in my
	arms. It’s gotta be.
	FONNY (V.O.)
	It’s gotta be.
	TISH
	I see you been eatin’, good.
	FONNY
	Look like I ain’t the only one.
	TISH
	Nope: the apple don’t fall too far
	from the tree.
	FONNY
	Who all this for?
	TISH
	Who you think?
	ALONZO
	For you, daddy.
	FONNY
	Where you get the money to pay for
	all this? You got a job now, man?
	You runnin’ numbers?
	TISH
	Say dollar straight, dollar box.
	ALONZO
	Dollar straight, dollar --
	FONNY
	Hey don’t be teachin’ him that
	mess.
	FONNY
	What’s that?
	ALONZO JR
	That’s wen you come home daddy.
	TISH
	Ever since I told him... he just
	writes it everywhere.
	FONNY
	Well, I don’t know about y’all but,
	I’m starving.
	ALONZO
	No, you gotta say grace.
	FONNY
	Well alright then.
	ALONZO JR.
	Close your eyes, daddy.
	Thank you, God, for the food we are
	about to eat. And for all of your
	blessings that we have received.
	And for my daddy.
	In Jesus name, Amen.
	TISH & FONNY
	Amen.
