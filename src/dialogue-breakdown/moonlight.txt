I'm from Cuba. Lotta black folks in
Cuba but you wouldn't know it from
being here. Was a wild lil' shorty
just like you, used to run around
with no shoes on when the moon was
out.
This one time... I ran by this old,
old lady, was just a runnin' and a
hollerin' and cuttin' a fool, boy.
And this old lady, she stop me and
she say to me, 'Look at you.
I was a lil’ bad ass too, you
know.' She say, ‘Look at you’ and I
say ‘Look at you!’ Then she smiled
and she say, ‘running around
catching up all this light. In
moonlight’ she say, ‘black boys
look blue. You blue,’ she say.
‘That’s what I’m gone call you:
Blue.’
So how you like swimmin’?

LITTLE

You're not a faggot.
You can be gay, but... you don't

A slow nod from Chiron.

TERESA
Then what you sayin’?
TERESA

But if you wanna be somethin’

TERESA

CHIRON
Yeah. I know. Thank you Teresa, I

TERESA
But if you gonna stay here you got

PAULA
Uh huh, I know that bitch like a
hooker know her trick. You my
child, okay? And tell that bitch
she better not forget it.
Go on to school. Ain’t you late?
Chiron just staring, his mother in physical form but someone
entirely different in mind and spirit.
Paula looks up from her counting, finds that scornful face so
much like hers looking down on her.
MR. PIERCE
So can you see how a lack of white
blood cells could be dangerous to
the human body?
Okay, can anybody explain what will
happen to the body when there’s not
enough white blood cells?
Nobody’s leaving this classroom
until I get a response, this is
more important for you than it is
for me, trust me.
MR. PIERCE
Terrell?
TERRELL
Ummm yeah Mr. Pierce, I’m gonna
answer this question, man...

Ain’t enough white blood cells in

Pierce.
MR. PIERCE
Terrell.
TERRELL
I’m sorry man, I’m sorry, no
disrespect Mr. Pierce, I’m just

And check it: without the white
blood cells, body can’t defend
itself. That’s why all them gay
niggas croakin’ off that AIDS shit,

Hey Little, wait up man, where you

TERRELL

CHIRON

CHIRON

CHIRON
You cry?
KEVIN
Nah. But it make me want to.
KEVIN
What you cry about? You cry,
Chiron?
CHIRON
I cry so much sometimes I think one
day I’m gone just turn into drops.
KEVIN
But then you could just roll out
into the water, right? Roll out
into the water like all these other
muhfuckers out here tryna drown

CHIRON

KEVIN
I’m just listenin’ to you, nigga.

Not much.
Just trouble.
KEVIN
Chiron and trouble always found a
way.
BLACK
Yeah... something like that.
What about you?
KEVIN
I’m a cook, man.
BLACK
You a cook?
KEVIN
Yeah man, got sent up for some
stupid shit, same stupid shit we
always get sent up for. Put me on
the kitchen line and I kinda took
to it.
BLACK
Greeeeaaaaaaaaat day, Kevin Jones:
Chef Boyardee.
KEVIN
I cook better than that shit.
BLACK
You better or your ass won’t be
cooking long, feel me?
KEVIN
Yeah, so... I just thought about
you man. There’s a jukebox in here,
folks come in and play they songs
and that’s the music we get in
here. This dude, man....
BLACK
Yeah....
KEVIN
...this dude reminded me of you.
BLACK
What’d he play?
BLACK
That good, huh?
KEVIN
Yeah...
...that good.
If you ever come down here, man,
you holla at me.
BLACK
This your number?
KEVIN
Nah, no cell. This the diner. Right
now it’s better if folks can’t
reach me. I tell niggas, “Call my
momma house if you really need me,”
otherwise I’m only ‘bout this J-OB.
BLACK
True.
What’s the name of the place?
KEVIN
Jimmy’s Eastside Diner. If you ever
to town, Chiron, I mean it. Come on
by, I’ll cook you somethin’, play
that song for you.
KEVIN
Alright Chiron, be easy.
Be right with you.
Be right with you, boss, just let
me get this out the way.
...and moves past.
How you doin’ tonight, what can I
get you?
Chiron?
Damn man why you ain’t say
nothin’?!
Damn Chiron.
BLACK
‘Sup, Kev’.
KEVIN
What the hell you doin’ here, I
mean....
Well shit, you here now, that’s all
that matter.
There go that damn noddin’, you
ain’t changed a bit, still can’t
say more than three words at a
time, huh?
BLACK
Said you was gon’ cook for me, I
know how to say that.
KEVIN
Yeah I did, man. I did.
What you want? You can pick from
the menu or I can give you the
chef’s special.
Yeah.
We here, Chiron.
Chef’s special.
BLACK
So you Cuban now?
KEVIN
Only in the kitchen, Papi.
Sit down, nigga. Or you gon’ eat
standin’ up?
KEVIN
Want a drink?
BLACK
I don’t drink.
KEVIN
Nigga I ain’t seen you in like a
decade, you gon’ drink with me.
So what bring you here, Chiron?
Eat your dinner man.
Eat your dinner.
You remember Samantha?
BLACK
Yeah, I remember her.
KEVIN
Kevin Jr.
Me and Samantha. Had him young; too
young.
When I got locked up, man. It was
hard. Real hard. Had me in state,
not that county shit. That’s when I
knew I had to find somethin’.
That’s when I started the cookin’
thing, knew I couldn’t go back to
the street, not after that.
BLACK
Y’all still down?
KEVIN
Me and Sam?
Nah. We still cool though, gotta be
for Lil’ man, but... nah, not like
that.
KEVIN
What about you?
BLACK
What about me?
KEVIN
Nigga tell me somethin’, what you
doin’, who you doin’?
C’mon nigga, I’m waitin’, done
cooked for your ass and everything,
shit, these grandma rules you know
the drill, you gon’ eat, you gotta
speak.
BLACK
Alright, straight up?
I’m trappin’.
KEVIN
What?
BLACK
When they sent me up to Atlanta,
put me straight into Juvie for
beatin’ old boy. Met this cat in
there, when I come out, put me on
the block. Did good at it. Rose up.
It is what it is.
KEVIN
Bullshit, it ain’t what it is,
Chiron, that ain’t you.
BLACK
Nigga you don’t know me.
KEVIN
Oh I don’t?
BLACK
I’ma get my shit straight.
KEVIN
And I guess gettin’ your shit
straight is drivin’ twelve hours
down here for no reason?
And why you got them damn fronts?
BLACK
Why’d you call me?
KEVIN
What?
BLACK
Why did you call me?
KEVIN
I told you, this dude came in....
BLACK
Yeah...
KEVIN
He played this song....
This you?
You wasn’t playin’ bout them traps.
BLACK
How you get to work?
KEVIN
Jitney.
Bus.
Sometimes Samantha shoot me out
there if I got Lil’ Kevin.
BLACK
Can’t picture bein’ in Miami with
no car, man.
KEVIN
Yeah it’s real out here.
BLACK
I bet.
KEVIN
Real slow, real hot, real busted,
got me like a duck out here.
BLACK
You on one.
KEVIN
Nah man, I’m just tired.
I used to be up in them traps, too.
Wasn’t easy; was hard as hell,
harder than this, man, but not
much. Feel like I work damn near as
hard to make a day’s pay trappin’
in two weeks cookin’.
Make everything hurt a lot more.
Feel like that cat from In Livin’
Color: “My neck, my back... my neck
and my back.”
Bet on this the ride, Chi’.
BLACK
Can’t have you on no Jitney.
KEVIN
So Chiron....
You just drove here?
BLACK
Yeah.
KEVIN
Like you just was on one and got on
the highway?
BLACK
Yeah.
KEVIN
Where you gon’ stay tonight?
Want somethin’ to drink? Beer?
Water?
BLACK
Yeah. Some water.
KEVIN
Who is you, man?
BLACK
Who, me?
KEVIN
Yeah, nigga.
You.
Them fronts? That car? Who is you,
Chiron?
BLACK
I’m me, man, ain’t tryna be nothin’
else.
KEVIN
So you hard now?
BLACK
I ain’t say that.
KEVIN
Then what?
Beat.
KEVIN
Look, I’m not tryna hem you up.
Just... I ain’t seen you in a
minute. Not what I expected, none
of it. Not good or bad, just not
what I expected.
BLACK
Well what did you expect?
KEVIN
You remember the last time I saw
you?
BLACK
For a long time, tried not to
remember.
BLACK
Tried to forget all those times.
The good...
...the bad.
All of it.
KEVIN
Yeah.
I know.
BLACK
When we got to Atlanta... I started
over. Built myself from the ground
up. Built myself hard.
BLACK
What about you?
KEVIN
Me? I just kept on, man. I wasn’t
never worth shit, never did
anything I actually wanted to do,
was all I could do to do what other
folks thought I should do, I wasn’t
never myself.
BLACK
And now?
KEVIN
Now? Now I got Lil’ Kev’, got this
job man, got another 18 months of
probation.
BLACK
Damn... that’s real shit.
KEVIN
Yeah, but it’s a life, you know? I
never had that before. Like... I’m
tired as hell right now and I ain’t
makin’ more than shoe money, but...
I got no worries, man. Not them
kind what I had before. That’s some
real shit, that’s that Bob Marley
shit, nigga.
BLACK
You’re the only man who’s ever
touched me.
The only one.
I haven’t really touched anyone,
since.
KEVIN
You shakin’.
BLACK
Yeah.
KEVIN
Wait.
BLACK
I’m shakin’.
KEVIN
Yeah.
BLACK
I’m still shakin’.
KEVIN
Yeah.
