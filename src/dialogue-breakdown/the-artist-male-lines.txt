I'm not telling!   I won't talk!!!
No. I don't get helped.   I give the help around here.
Free Georgia forever!!!
 We've arrived, welcome to France!!!
 Contemporary film!   Five girls who can dance!
 Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife. A nice
      piece, to make it up to her.
Remove that screen and bring me another one!    On
the double!
Because of this childish nonsense, there's
nothing about the film before page 5!
If you want to be an actress, you need to have
     something no one else has.
      I want to show you something.     Right now.
       We belong to another age, you and I, George.
     Nowadays, the world talks.
      People want to see new faces. Talking faces.
      Paramount will be delighted. They still want me.
      I'm sorry. The public wants fresh blood. And the
     public is never wrong.
     It's me the people want and it's my films they
     want to see. And I'm going to give them to them.
     I don't need you. Go make your talking movies.
     I'm going to make them a beautiful film!
     Fresh blood...
     How are you?

     Or not.
      So are millions of other people, me for instance.
      Your first film doesn't come out until tomorrow
     and yet you're already the new darling of Hollywood! How do
     you explain that?


     It would seem that we're ruined.
     That's the best case scenario...
     Let's go back, Norma. They've never seen a white
     woman before and I don't want to take any risks.
     Farewell, Norma.    I never loved you...
     And so you've come to get your money back?
     Too much face-pulling?
     You're right. Make way for youth...
     I'm so happy to meet you. My Dad just loves you.
     See, could be it just wasn't my day...
      How long's it been since I paid you last,
     Clifton?
      Been one year now, Sir.
       You're fired. Keep the car. Get yourself a job
     someplace else.

     Well done! It all sold, there's nothing left!
     Look what you've become...
You were very nasty! And stupid! And arrogant!
You acted very badly! You were thoughtless!
                                            
     COME BACK! COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!!
     He's not in any danger now. He just needs to
      rest.
       He was holding that. It was real hard to pry it
      away from him.
      It's probably the very best he could have hoped
      for.
      What are you doing?
      And why not...
      I work for Miss Miller now.
      She's been good to you. She's always looked out
      for you.
      What did you say?
        BANG!
        No, I'm nothing but a shadow. No good for
      anything but silence.
      Cut! Excellent!
       Once more? Please?
       With pleasure!
       OK, Camera! Sound!
Rolling... and... Action!
