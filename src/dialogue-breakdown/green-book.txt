	BOBBY RYDELL
	Thank you very much! Welcome to
	Jules Podell’s Copacabana! I’m
	Bobby Rydell and I’m happy to be
	here!
	That old Black Magic has me in its
	spell...
	LOSCUDO
	Guard this hat with your life... My
	mother gave it to me.
	COAT-CHECK GIRL
	Yes, Mr. Loscudo...
	CARMINE
	Joey!
	LOSCUDO
	Hey, Carmine!
	CARMINE
	That’s not necessary...
	LOSCUDO
	Come on. You know I saw this kid
	Rydell last year in Philly. Nobody
	knew who he was.
	CARMINE
	Well they know him now...
	LIP
	Gimme Loscudo’s hat.
	COAT-CHECK GIRL
	But he said...
	LIP
	I know, just give it to me...
	PODELL
	Tony liiiiip!!!
	GOOMBAH
	You put your hands on me you punk?!?!
	LIP
	Do yourself a favor--go home with
	your friends.
	GOOMBAH
	Don’t you tell me where to go! Do
	you know who I am?! I’m goin’ back
	in there!
	LIP
	Nah, you’re not.
	BOBBY RYDELL (O.S.)
	...Whoa, that old Black Magic
	called loooooooove!
	LOSCUDO
	I‘ll burn this place down! Where’s
	my hat!
	COAT-CHECK GIRL
	I’m sorry, Mr. Loscudo, I went to
	the ladies room, I was only gone a
	minute...
	LOSCUDO
	Someone better find it!
	CARMINE
	It’ll turn up, I swear it’ll turn
	up.
	LOSCUDO
	Really? You tell that fat Jew
	bastard Podell that if it doesn’t
	turn up, I’ll burn this place down!
	You hear me? I’ll burn the Copa
	down!
	CARMINE
	Jesus Christ. Loscudo is out of his
	mind.
	DANNY
	We earned our money tonight.
	CARMINE
	Lip, I thought you were gonna kill
	that guy.
	LIP
	Better him than me. What are you
	gonna do while we’re closed?
	DANNY
	I don’t know. Maybe work at my
	Uncle’s pizza joint.
	LIP
	What about you?
	CARMINE
	I’m gonna drink for two months.
	JULES PODELL
	Take me home, Lip.
	LOSCUDO
	My hat! Jesus Christ, if you had
	tits, I’d kiss ya! How the hell’d
	you find it?
	LIP
	Heard it was missing, so I looked
	into it.
	LOSCUDO
	I wanted to kill that broad.
	LIP
	Wasn’t her fault.
	JILLY RIZZO
	Who had the balls to clip it?
	LIP
	Don’t worry about it, I took care
	of him.
	LOSCUDO
	I hope you gave him some beating.
	LIP
	No, I can’t. It was my pleasure,
	Mr. Loscudo.
	LOSCUDO
	Bullshit. And from now on you don’t
	have to call me Mister Loscudo, ya
	hear me?
	DOLORES
	‘Morning...
	LIP
	‘Night...
	PHIL RIZUTTO (V.O.)
	“Roger Maris at the plate, Pierce
	checks the signs...”
	JOHNNY
	Come on, Roger! Hit one out!
	RUDY
	Be quiet, you’re gonna jinx it!
	LIP
	Johnny, think you can yell a little
	louder?
	JOHNNY
	Maris is up...
	LIP
	Yeah, so am I now. What the hell
	are you guys doing here?
	JOHNNY
	Figured we’d come up and keep
	Dolores company...
	ANTHONY
	You shouldn’t be sleeping in the
	middle of the day, leaving my
	daughter here alone with these
	sacks of coal.
	NICOLA
	And why do you hire them to do an
	Italian’s job? It’s a disgrace.
	LIP
	I don’t know who they’re gonna
	send.
	BLACK WORKMAN
	Thank you, ma’am.
	PHIL RIZUTTO (V.O.)
	“Deep to center field, holy cow he
	did it! A home run for Roger Maris!
	Holy cow!”
	DOLORES
	Get dressed, Tony, we’re gonna eat.
	DOLORES
	Bless us our Lord, for these thy
	gifts, which we are about to
	receive, from thy bounty through
	Christ our Lord, Amen.
	They all make the sign of the cross.
	NICOLA
	Salute.
	DOLORES
	If anyone hears about a job for
	Tony, let us know.
	LIP
	Dolores...
	RUDY
	What happened, you get fired?
	DOLORES
	No, Copa’s closing for repairs. He
	needs something for just a couple
	months.
	JOHNNY
	I’ll ask around.
	NICOLA
	Mister big shot. Always spend,
	spend, spend. No job, he gets
	himself a new kitchen floor.
	LIP
	Come on, Pop. The kids were gettin’
	splinters in their feet.
	FRAN
	All the people he knows, he’ll find
	something.
	JOHNNY
	He had a great job at the
	sanitation department.
	You shouldn’t have punched out the
	foreman.
	LIP
	He shouldn’t have woke me up.
	JOHNNY
	I’m tellin’ you, this is gonna be
	the easiest fifty bucks you ever
	made.
	FAT PAULIE
	Johnny told me you ate forty-eight
	White Castle burgers in one
	sitting.
	FRANKIE
	Cheeseburgers.
	FAT PAULIE
	I don’t believe you.
	LIP
	What do I care if you believe me?
	Gorman, who’s got the record for
	hotdogs here?
	GORMAN
	Fat Paulie. Fifteen.
	JOHNNY
	Why wasn’t Lip in on that contest?
	FAT PAULIE
	What contest? I was hungry.
	GORMAN
	Bet’s simple. Half a C-note. Most
	hotdogs in an hour wins. With
	toppings.
	LIP
	What the hell you weigh?
	FAT PAULIE
	Two-sixty.
	JOHNNY
	Aaaaay. Your left ass weighs twosixty.
	FAT PAULIE
	May my mother-in-law drop dead on
	the spot if I’m lyin’.
	LIP
	Okay, you’re on.
	JOHNNY
	Come on, Lip, pick it up! The baby
	elephant just hit nineteen!
	LIP
	Nicky, you doin’ your homework?
	NICK
	Yeah.
	DOLORES
	Where were you?
	LIP
	Gorman’s. Fat Paulie bet me fifty
	bucks he could eat more hot dogs
	than me. He knocked off twentyeight. Guy’s an animal.
	DOLORES
	Are you crazy--you lost fifty
	dollars?!
	LIP
	Dolores, please. I ate thirty.
	DOLORES
	Thank God. The gas bill came in
	today.
	LIP
	Yeah?
	JULES PODELL
	Hey, Lip, some guy called over here
	-- a doctor’s lookin’ for a driver.
	You interested?
	LIP
	Yeah.
	JULES PODELL
	They’re interviewing guys tomorrow
	afternoon. Here’s the address.
	WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
	Excuse me. We’re not open right
	now...
	BOX OFFICE MANAGER
	But you’re welcome to buy tickets
	to tonight’s performance.
	LIP
	‘There a doctor’s office ‘round
	here? I think I got the wrong
	address.
	BOX OFFICE MANAGER
	You have the correct address. Dr.
	Shirley lives upstairs, above the
	hall.
	LIP
	I’m here for the driver job. Tony
	Lip.
	I should be on there.
	AMIT
	No Tony Lip. I do have a Tony
	Val...Valle...
	LIP
	Vallelonga. That’s me.
	AMIT
	Fill this out while you wait.
	LIP
	What?
	AMIT
	Fill. It. Out. While you wait.
	AMIT
	Take a seat.
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Mr. Vallelonga, sorry to keep you
	waiting...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’m Dr. Donald Shirley.
	LIP
	Hi. Tony.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Please, have a seat.
	LIP
	This is some place you got here.
	Them horns real?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Elephant tusks. Yes.
	LIP
	What about that? That a molar?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	A what?
	LIP
	A molar.
	Like a shark tooth? Or a tiger’s?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Um, no. It was a gift.
	LIP
	Oh.
	I thought I was going to an office.
	They said a doctor needed a driver.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	That’s all they told you?
	Actually, it’s a bit more
	complicated than that. Have you
	ever driven professionally before?
	LIP
	Sanitation.
	Garbage trucks.
	Plus I drive my boss home at night.
	I can drive anything.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I see. What other experience do you
	have?
	LIP
	I worked a lot of joints. The Wagon
	Wheel, Peppermint Lounge, Copa...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	In what capacity?
	LIP
	What do you mean?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	What did you do there?
	LIP
	Public relations...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Well, first of all, Tony, I’m not a
	medical doctor. I’m a musician.
	LIP
	You mean like songs?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Yes. I’m about to start a concert
	tour, the majority of which will be
	down South.
	LIP
	Atlantic City?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	The deep south. We start in the
	midwest, but then we’re taking a
	hard left. Kentucky, North
	Carolina, Tennessee, and on down
	through the Delta.
	Do you foresee any issues working
	for a black man?
	LIP
	No, no... ’fact just yesterday me
	and the wife had a couple colored
	guys over the house. For drinks.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Oh, I see. You’re married.
	LIP
	Yup. Two kids.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I don’t know if this is the proper
	job for a married man.
	LIP
	Why, we bringing broads?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	My point is, you’ll be gone for
	eight straight weeks--with no
	breaks--right up until Christmas.
	You’re quite sure you can leave
	your family for that long?
	LIP
	Depends on what you’re paying.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Ninety dollars a week, plus room
	and board. But let me be crystal
	clear... I’m not simply hiring a
	chauffeur. I need someone who can
	handle my itinerary. I need a
	personal assistant. I need a valet.
	I need someone who will launder my
	clothes, shine my shoes...
	LIP
	Good luck, Doc.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Tony...
	I had my record label ask around
	town to find me the right man. Your
	name came up more than once. You’ve
	impressed a lot of people by the
	way you handle... trouble. That’s
	why I called and asked about your
	availability.
	LIP
	Look, I got no problem being on the
	road with you. But I ain’t no
	butler, I ain’t ironing shirts, and
	I’m not shining nobody’s shoes. You
	need someone to get you from point
	A to point B? You need someone to
	make sure there’s no problems along
	the way -- and you going through
	the deep South, believe me, there’s
	gonna be problems. So if you want
	me, it’s gotta be a buck and a
	quarter a week. Or go hire the
	little Chink that just pranced out
	of here and see how far you get.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Well, Mr. Vallelonga...thank you
	for coming in.
	LIP
	Bobby, give me a Rheingold. Ice
	cold.
	BOBBY
	Mister Tony. Augie asking about
	you.
	CUSTOMER
	Come on, I’m dying of thirst over
	here!
	BOBBY
	Shut up, I’m talking!
	LIP
	When?
	BOBBY
	Now. He in his box.
	AUGIE
	Tony Lip. What the hell happened at
	the Copa? I heard you split a guy’s
	face open.
	That guy you hit. He was one of
	Charlie the Hand’s crew.
	LIP
	Then he shoulda known better.
	AUGIE
	The Hand wanted me to look into it.
	I spoke to Podell. Whole thing was
	over a piece of ass, right?
	A beef like that should never
	happen in the club. They were out
	of line. So we squashed it.
	Sit down. Have something to eat.
	LIP
	Thanks, but I already ate.
	AUGIE
	You looking to earn some extra
	scharole? I could keep you busy
	while the Copa’s down.
	LIP
	What I gotta do?
	AUGIE
	Things...
	Lip thinks about it.
	LIP
	Appreciate it, but I’m gonna spend
	some time with the family.
	AUGIE
	Don’t be stupid. You can make a few
	bucks, buy something nice for your
	wife.
	LIP
	I’m good. I’m flush right now.
	PAWN GUY
	Here’s fifty. Give me sixty before
	Christmas, you get it back.
	Hey, Lip... everything okay?
	LIP
	You got beak trouble, Charlie? Mind
	your business.
	DOLORES
	So what happened with the doctor
	interview?
	LIP
	He ain’t a real doctor, he’s a
	piano player.
	DOLORES
	I don’t understand--why’d they say
	he was a doctor?
	LIP
	I don’t know. I think he’s like a
	doctor of piano-playing or
	something.
	DOLORES
	You can be that?
	LIP
	I guess. He lives on top of
	Carnegie Hall. You shoulda seen
	this place, Dee--it was filled with
	statues and all kinds of fancy
	crap. And he was sitting on a
	friggin’ throne all dressed up like
	the king of the jungle bunnies.
	DOLORES
	He’s colored? You wouldn’t last a
	week with him.
	LIP
	For the right money, I would.
	LIP
	Hello... Yeah... Really?... Why?...
	Okay, hold on.
	DOLORES
	Everything okay?
	LIP
	It’s him.
	DOLORES
	Who?
	LIP
	Dr. Shirley, the piano guy. He
	wants to talk to you.
	DOLORES
	Me? What? Why?
	Hello... Good morning, Doctor, nice
	to talk to you, too...
	Yes, that is a long time...
	It is...Yes, I’m sure...Thank you
	for calling...Goodbye.
	LIP
	What he say?
	Dolores looks stunned.
	DOLORES
	He wanted to know if I’d be okay
	with him taking my husband away
	from his family for two months. He
	said he’d pay you what you asked
	for.
	LIP
	It’s good money, Dolores. You know
	we need it. I can’t be eatin’
	thirty hot dogs every day.
	DOLORES
	I know...I said it was okay for you
	to go.
	RECORD EXEC
	Here’s the first half of your pay.
	You’ll get the rest when the tour’s
	over.
	LIP
	Uh-uh, I gotta get paid every week.
	RECORD EXEC
	Sorry, that’s not how the record
	company does it.
	We gotta have some guarantee you’ll
	finish the job.
	LIP
	Why the hell wouldn’t I finish the
	job? I took it, didn’t I?
	RECORD EXEC
	Then you’ve got nothing to worry
	about.
	Here’s the deal, Mr. Vallelonga.
	It’s your job to get Don to all his
	tour dates on time. If he misses
	any shows, you’re not getting your
	back-end.
	LIP
	He’s not gonna miss any shows.
	RECORD EXEC
	Good. And you’re going to need
	this.
	It’s the book I told you about.
	Sometimes you’re staying in the
	same hotels, and sometimes you’re
	not.
	JOHNNY
	Madonne. This the new one?
	LIP
	The record company rented it.
	JOHNNY
	So what’d my sister say about you
	being gone for three weeks?
	LIP
	Eight weeks.
	JOHNNY
	Yeah, right. Ten-to-one you slap
	the moolie out and come home under
	a month.
	DOLORES
	Come here. Say goodbye to your
	father.
	LIP
	Stop that. You gotta be big boys,
	take care of your mother...
	DOLORES
	Did you go to the A-A-A for the
	maps?
	LIP
	The record guy gave me maps and
	directions with the itinerary
	thing. And this.
	DOLORES
	The Negro Motorist Green-Book?
	LIP
	Lists all the places coloreds can
	stay down south. Like if you’re
	traveling while black.
	DOLORES
	Traveling while black?
	LIP
	Yeah. Like if you’re black but you
	gotta travel for some reason.
	DOLORES
	They got a special book for that?
	LIP
	I guess.
	DOLORES
	Did you pack an iron?
	LIP
	I ain’t lugging around no iron,
	Dee.
	DOLORES
	How you gonna keep your pants
	pressed?
	LIP
	I’ll put ‘em under my mattress.
	DOLORES
	I want you to write me a letter
	every chance you get.
	LIP
	Aw, come on, Dee, I can’t write
	letters.
	DOLORES
	Take you five minutes. Promise me.
	LIP
	I can’t write, it’s embarrassing--
	they ain’t gonna be no good.
	DOLORES
	It’s a lot cheaper than callin’
	long distance, Tony. Promise me
	you’ll write.
	LIP
	Okay. I promise. I’ll try.
	Yeah.
	Put this in the bank today.
	DOLORES
	I made a couple veal-cutlet
	sandwiches for you and Dr. Shirley.
	Be careful. I love you.
	LIP
	Love you, too.
	DOLORES
	You better be home at Christmas or
	don’t come home at all!
	NICOLA
	He who arrives late has no bed!
	LIP
	Bum a smoke?
	I’m Tony. You the band?
	OLEG
	Oleg. Cello.
	GEORGE
	George. Bass. And we’re not a band,
	we’re a trio.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thank you, Amit.
	AMIT
	Have a wonderful trip, Doctor.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Tony, when we arrive in a city, the
	first thing I’d like you to do is
	check the piano where I’m playing.
	Make sure it’s a Steinway as per my
	contract.
	And could you see to it that I have
	a bottle of Cutty Sark in my room
	every night.
	LIP
	Every night?
	Well if you ever need any help with
	that...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I won’t. And ten-and-two on the
	wheel, please.
	LIP
	Doc, I noticed on the itinerary
	thing there that the last show’s
	December 23rd.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Birmingham, yes. It’s a Christmas
	show.
	LIP
	Any way we could hit the road early
	the next morning so we could be back
	home in time for Christmas Eve?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	We’ll see. Could you please put the
	cigarette out?
	LIP
	Why?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Because I can’t breathe back here.
	LIP
	What are you talking about? Smoke’s
	going into my lungs. I’m doing all
	the work here.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thank you.
	OLEG
	Everything okay?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Yes. Everything’s fine.
	OLEG
	Good. We’ll meet you at the hotel
	in Pittsburgh.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Make a reservation for dinner.
	We’ll rehearse immediately after.
	See you there.
	LIP
	Hell’s he looking at?
	You speak German, huh?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	That was Russian.
	LIP
	Yeah, I was stationed in Germany in
	the army. I can pick up a little of
	what you’re sayin’. Be careful,
	Krauts are all sneaks. Kennedy
	shoulda bombed ‘em when we had the
	chance--plus now them Cuban
	bastards.
	Where they going anyway? Ain’t they
	supposed to be following us?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	They have the itinerary. As long as
	they make it to the shows on time,
	I don’t worry and you shouldn’t
	either.
	LIP
	I ain’t worried about nothin’.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	How is that?
	LIP
	Salty.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Have you ever thought of being a
	food critic?
	LIP
	Not really, but...why? Is there
	money in that?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’m just saying, you have a
	marvelous way with words when
	describing food. Salty. So vivid.
	One can almost taste it.
	LIP
	I’m saying it’s salty, and salt’s
	cheatin’. Any cook can make things
	salty. But to make it taste good
	without the salt, with just the
	other flavors, that’s the trick.
	See, when you--
	DR. SHIRLEY
	We should be going soon if we
	expect to get to Pittsburgh by
	dinner.
	LIP
	You know, when I was in the army I
	knew a guy from Pittsburgh, but he
	called it Titsburgh because he said
	all the girls there have big tits.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	That’s absurd. Why would women in
	Pittsburgh have larger breasts
	than, say, women in New York?
	LIP
	‘The hell I know? Guess we’ll find
	out, huh?
	By the way, when you hired me, my
	wife went out bought one of your
	records--’one about the orphans.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Orphans?
	LIP
	Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids
	sitting around a campfire?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Orpheus.
	LIP
	What?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Orpheus in the Underworld. It’s
	based on a French Opera. And those
	kids on the cover? They were demons
	in hell.
	LIP
	No shit? Must of been naughty kids.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	What are you doing?
	LIP
	I gotta take a leak.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Here? Now?
	LIP
	What, you want me to piss my pants?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Take this for any incidentals we
	may need. If you want something for
	yourself, you don’t have to ask me,
	just make sure you keep the
	receipts. When it runs low, let me
	know.
	One more thing--we will be
	attending many events before and
	after the concerts, interacting
	with some of the wealthiest and
	most highly-educated people in the
	country. It is my feeling that your
	diction, as charming as it may be
	in the tri-state area, could use a
	bit of finessing.
	LIP
	Like you mean diction in what way?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	In the only way the word “diction”
	is ever used.
	LIP
	Okay...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Your intonation, inflection, choice
	of words--
	LIP
	Ayyyy, I got my own problems, I
	gotta worry what other people think
	about the way I talk?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	There are simple techniques I can
	teach you that are quite effective.
	I can help you.
	LIP
	I don’t need no goddamn help. If
	people don’t like the way I talk,
	they can go take a shit.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	The profanity is another issue.
	LIP
	A fanabla, why you breakin’ my
	balls?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Because you can do better. And
	here’s another thing--as guest of
	honor, I will be announced when I
	enter these intimate events. You
	will be announced as well.
	Vallelonga may be difficult to
	pronounce. I was thinking “Valle”
	would be more appropriate. Tony
	Valle. It’s short and simple.
	LIP
	Nuh-uh. If they got a problem with
	Vallelonga, they can call me Tony
	Lip.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	These are genteel people. That might
	be a little...worldly for them.
	LIP
	Then it’s Tony Vallelonga. All
	these high-class people that are so
	much smarter than me, with all
	their intelligence and speakin’
	abilities, you’re telling me they
	can’t pronounce my name?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’m just telling you, Valle will
	make things easier.
	LIP
	My last name is Vallelonga and I
	ain’t changing it for nobody. They
	don’t like it, they can shove it up
	their ass--I’ll just wait outside.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	A sound compromise.
	MC
	Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we
	are privileged to present a great
	American artist. He gave his first
	public performance at the age of
	three. At age eighteen, at Arthur
	Fiedler's invitation, our guest
	made his concert debut with the
	Boston Pops. He holds Doctorates in
	Psychology, in Music, and in the
	Liturgical Arts, and has performed
	at the White House twice in the
	last fourteen months. He is a true
	virtuoso.
	LIP
	Virtuoso--that’s Italian. Means
	he’s really good.
	MC
	Ladies and gentleman, please
	welcome The Don Shirley Trio!
	BUSBOY
	Shit! He won again!
	LIP
	Hey, it’s your dice, I’m just
	having a lucky day.
	DR. SHIRLEY (O.S.)
	Tony!
	cars.
	CHAUFFEUR
	Boss man’s callin’.
	LIP
	He ain’t my boss. I work for the
	record company.
	BUSBOY
	Come on! Give us a chance to win
	back our loot!
	LIP
	Sorry, fellas, duty calls!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’ve been looking for you.
	LIP
	Sorry. The guys were having a
	little game.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	If you need extra money, next time,
	ask me.
	LIP
	It’s more fun winning it.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	What if you lost?
	LIP
	Craps and cards, I don’t lose, Doc.
	I don’t lose.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	And stooping down in the gravel
	throwing dice for pocket change
	makes you a winner?
	LIP
	What are you giving me shit for?
	Everybody was doin’ it.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	They didn’t have a choice whether
	to be inside or out. You did.
	Let’s go. And wipe your knees,
	you’ve got dirt on them.
	LIP (V.O.)
	Dear Dolores... How are you? I am
	fine...
	DOLORES
	“I’m eating real good--hamburgers
	mostly--so don’t worry about me not
	eating good. We are doing lots of
	driving around, and we talk a lot
	in the car. I saw Dr. Shirley
	tonight play piano. He doesn’t play
	like a colored guy. He plays like
	Liberace but better and I ain’t
	lying. He’s like a genius I think.
	When I look at him in the rear-view
	mirror, I can tell he’s always
	thinking and working stuff out in
	his head, I guess that’s what
	geniuses do. But it don’t look fun
	to be that smart. I miss you very
	very much, Baby. Love, Tony. P.S.--
	I told you I can’t write letters,
	ha ha! Regards to your father and
	brother. I’m going to get a haircut
	tomorrow. P.S.--Kiss Nickie and
	Frankie both for me.”
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Who is this?
	LIP
	What?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	On the radio.
	LIP
	Lil’ Richard.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	This is Little Richard?
	LIP
	Yeah, he’s good. Think you could
	play somethin’ like this, Doc?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	(of course he could)
	I don’t know. Sounds very
	complicated.
	So where did this “Tony the Lip”
	moniker come from?
	LIP
	Not Tony the Lip. Tony Lip--it’s
	one word. I got it when I was a
	kid. My friends said I was the best
	bullshit artist in the Bronx.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Why are you smiling?
	LIP
	Huh?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You don’t mind that your friends--
	the people closest to you--consider
	you a liar?
	LIP
	I never said liar, I said bullshit
	artist.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	What’s the difference?
	LIP
	I don’t lie. I’m just good at, you
	know, talking people into doin’
	things they don’t wanna do. By
	bullshittin’ ‘em.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	And you’re proud of that?
	LIP
	Well it got me this job.
	LIP
	You’re full of shit! You never
	hearda Chubby Checker?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Of course I’ve heard of him, I just
	never heard his music.
	But I like this. He’s got a silky
	voice... smooth.
	LIP
	This is what everyone dances to now --
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Eyes on the road please.
	LIP
	How about this? You know this song.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I don’t think so...
	LIP
	How could you not know this music?
	Chubby Checker, Lil’ Richard, Sam
	Cooke, Aretha--these are your
	people!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Before we pull out, Tony, we need
	to talk. I just heard something
	that disturbed me a great deal. I
	gave you petty cash.
	LIP
	Yeah, so?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Oleg told me what you did.
	LIP
	What I do?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You stole a jade stone from the
	store.
	LIP
	No I didn’t.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	He watched you do it.
	LIP
	I didn’t steal no stone.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You picked it up and you put it in
	your pocket.
	LIP
	Yeah, I picked a rock up off the
	ground--I didn’t steal one from the
	box.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Why would you pick up a rock off
	the ground?
	LIP
	‘Cause that ain’t stealin’. It’s
	just a regular rock.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	But why would you want a regular
	rock?
	LIP
	I don’t know, just to have. Like
	for good luck maybe.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	A lucky rock? Let me see it.
	I want you to go back and pay for
	it.
	LIP
	I told you that Kraut was a sneak.
	Rats me out for something I didn’t
	even do.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Pay for the stone, Tony, you’ll
	feel better.
	LIP
	I feel fine, and I’m not paying for
	no regular rock I found in the
	dirt.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga.
	Feel better?
	LIP
	No.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Tony, if you’d like, I will happily
	buy you that stone.
	LIP
	Don’t bother. You took all the fun
	out of it.
	As Shirley’s Cadillac pulls back onto the highway, we go...
	LIP
	Excuse me... I’m with the band.
	STAGE MANAGER
	You’re all set up.
	LIP
	This ain’t the piano, right?
	The STAGE MANAGER approaches. This guy’s big, Duke Wayne with
	a hammer holster.
	STAGE MANAGER
	That’s it.
	LIP
	This isn’t a Steinway...?
	STAGE MANAGER
	So what?
	LIP
	Dr. Shirley only plays on
	Steinway-brand pianos. It’s in his
	written contract.
	STAGE MANAGER
	Who’s Dr. Shirley?
	LIP
	Dr. Shirley--the Don Shirley Trio?
	STAGE MANAGER
	Does it really matter?
	LIP
	Yes, it does. It’s in his contract.
	STAGE MANAGER
	Come on, what’s the difference --
	these coons can play on anything.
	LIP
	But there’s garbage in this thing.
	STAGE MANAGER
	So, take it out.
	LIP
	What’d you say?
	STAGE MANAGER
	You heard me.
	LIP
	Get a clean Steinway in here.
	STAGE MANAGER
	There’s no Steinway on campus.
	LIP
	Not my problem.
	STAGE MANAGER
	I bet there ain’t two Steinways in
	the whole state of Indiana.
	LIP
	Then you better move your ass and
	start lookin’.
	STAGE MANAGER
	Who you think you’re talking to,
	LIP (V.O.)
	“Dear Dolores... This morning I had
	steak and eggs. For breakfast.”
	LIP (V.O.)
	“The band has been playing at very
	ritzy joints. Dr. Shirley and I are
	getting along pretty good, but
	sometimes I think he gets depressed
	and drinks too much.”
	LIP (V.O.)
	“I never knew how very beautiful
	this country was. Now that I’m
	seeing it I know. You wouldn’t
	believe how beautiful nature is--it
	is as beautiful as they say. I wish
	I had a camera and took some
	pictures, they would be collector’s
	items, I wish I knew how to
	describe it to you.”
	LIP (V.O.)
	“And the traffic out here in the
	country is nothing, which is fine
	by me.”
	 48.
	LIP (V.O.)
	“Right now I’m eating spaghetti and
	meatballs in a diner that tastes
	like ketchup on Chinese noodles. I
	miss your cooking...”
	LIP
	“We are heading down south now... I
	will write you another letter when
	we get down south. I love you...
	Your husband Tony... P.S.--Kiss the
	kids for me...”
	LIP
	Got any family, Doc?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Not really.
	LIP
	Not really? Either you do or you
	don’t.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	It’s a long story, Tony.
	LIP
	What, we’re in a rush now?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I have a brother somewhere. We used
	to get together once in a
	while...but it got more and more
	difficult to keep in touch. That’s
	the curse of being a musician--
	you’re always on the road, like a
	carnival worker, or a criminal.
	It took a toll on my marriage as
	well.
	LIP
	You’re married?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Was.
	June was a good person--terrible
	grammar, but a kind soul.
	Unfortunately, I didn’t have the
	constitution to do a husband act as
	well as a concert pianist act. I
	couldn’t balance both worlds.
	LIP
	Kentucky Fried Chicken... in
	Kentucky! When’s that ever gonna
	happen?!
	LIP
	What do you want?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’m fine. Thank you.
	LIP
	This might be the best Kentucky
	Fried Chicken I ever had. But I
	guess it’s fresher down here,
	right?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone
	with your appetite.
	LIP
	No, I bought the bucket so you
	could have some.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’ve never had fried chicken in my
	life.
	LIP
	Who you bullshittin’? You people
	love the fried chicken, the grits,
	the colored greens...I love it,
	too. The negro cooks used to make
	it when I was in the army.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You have a very narrow assessment
	of me, Tony.
	LIP
	Yeah, I’m good, right?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	What? No. No, you’re not good,
	you’re bad. I’m saying, just
	because other negro people listen
	to a certain kind of music doesn’t
	mean I have to. Nor do we all have
	to eat the same food.
	LIP (CONT’D)
	Whoa, wait a minute. If you said
	all guineas like pizza and
	spaghetti and meatballs, I’m not
	gonna get insulted.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You’re missing the point. For you
	to make the assumption that--
	LIP
	Doc, you want some or not?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	No.
	LIP
	Tell me that don’t smell good?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	It smells okay, but I don’t want to
	get grease on my blanket.
	LIP
	Oooh, I’m gonna get grease on my
	blankie--have a piece. It ain’t
	gonna kill ya.
	Just grab it and eat it!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	No.
	LIP
	I’m gonna throw it in the back
	seat.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Don’t you dare!
	LIP
	Then you better take it.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	How? Do you even have utensils?
	Plates?
	LIP
	Bah fongool! Eat it with your hands,
	that’s how you’re supposed to.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I can’t do that.
	LIP
	I swear I’m gonna throw it!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I... I really can’t do this.
	LIP
	Eat the goddamn thing.
	What, no good?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I just... this seems so... so
	unsanitary.
	LIP
	‘Gives a shit?! Relax and enjoy it.
	My father always says, whatever you
	do, do it hundred percent. When you
	work, work, when you laugh, laugh,
	when you eat, eat like it’s your
	last meal.
	Want another piece? Have a leg!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	What do we do about the bones?
	LIP
	We do this.
	This can’t be it. Says right
	here...
	...cozy as your own home... This
	place looks like my ass.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	This is the place.
	LIP
	If you need anything, I’ll be up
	the street at the Easton Inn.
	So...see you tomorrow.
	MAN #1
	Hey, fancy-pants, you wanna play?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Um... no, thank you.
	MAN #2
	Come on, we short a man!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I... I’d rather not.
	MAN #1
	What, you too high and mighty?
	MAN #3
	He’s just afraid of getting that
	butler uniform all dusty!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’m just... I’m on my way out to
	meet a friend.
	LIP
	Vacation without aggravation...
	vaffangool.
	GEORGE (O.S.)
	Tony, it’s George! Wake up! Hurry
	up!
	Dr. Shirley’s in trouble.
	GEORGE
	I went out for a drink, I walk into
	this bar, and there’s Shirley
	getting bounced around! I didn’t
	want to leave him, but I didn’t
	know what to do!
	LIP (O.S.)
	Get your hands off him!
	REDNECK #1
	What the good goddamn we got here,
	fellas?
	LIP
	Hand him over, we walk out, won’t
	be a problem.
	REDNECK #1
	Already is a problem, Mister.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I just came in for a drink.
	REDNECK #1
	You come in here for a drink? Then
	you must be tired of livin’, boy.
	LIP
	I told you, hand him over, we’ll
	leave.
	REDNECK #2
	He ain’t going nowhere, we need
	this brillo pad to wash them dishes
	with...
	LIP
	Hey, do yourself a favor and let
	him go. Now.
	REDNECK #1
	Say it nice.
	LIP
	I just said it nice.
	REDNECK #1
	This boy’s gonna get what’s coming
	to him, and you ain’t got no say!
	LIP
	Maybe. But, whatever happens, I’m
	gonna put a bullet right in the
	middle of that thick skull of
	yours.
	REDNECK #2
	He ain’t got no gun, Ray. Let’s get
	him. He’s fulla shit.
	REDNECK #3
	What if he ain’t?
	MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
	Well, I sure ain’t.
	BARKEEP
	And I won’t be having none of this
	come to pass in my place. Let the
	spook go. I want these Yanks off my
	property.
	LIP
	What the hell’s wrong with you?!
	You go in there alone?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I apologize for putting you in that
	position, Tony.
	LIP
	I don’t understand you, Doc, honest
	to God. Why couldn’t you just drink
	here--you got a whole bottle?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I needed some air.
	LIP
	Air?! Don’t you know where you are?
	Shirley looks at him oddly.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Does the geography really matter?
	LIP
	What?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	If I walked into a bar in your
	neighborhood, would this
	conversation be any different?
	LIP
	From now on you don’t go nowhere
	without me. Nowhere!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Tony...Do you really have a gun?
	LIP
	‘Course not. Now get some rest. You
	got a big show tomorrow night. Now
	where’s your room doc?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thank you, Louisville, for your
	warm hospitality!
	LIP
	“Betty bought... a bit of buttah...
	but she found the buttah bittah...”
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Not buttah... butter. Say the “er.”
	LIP
	Er.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	“So Betty bought a bit of better
	butter to make the bitter butter
	better...”
	LIP
	“So Betty bit a buttah...”
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Don’t be lazy--enunciate. “So Betty
	bought a bit of better butter...”
	LIP
	“So, Betty bit a better buttah--”
	this is bullshit.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	No, you need to start somewhere.
	Athletes stretch to warm up before
	an event. A singer does vocal
	exercises. These drills will
	strengthen your speech muscles.
	MORGAN ANDERSON
	Ladies and gentlemen, our very
	special guest from the far north...
	Don Shirley!
	Accompanying Mr. Shirley, the
	members of his trio...
	Oleg Malakhov, George Dyer, and his
	associate, Tony Vallla...
	Valleg...Valle...
	Valley...lohnja.
	Gentlemen, if you don’t mind, I’m
	going to steal Donnie away for some
	introductions.
	LIP
	What’s this?
	WAITER
	Pimiento-cheese sandwich, sir.
	LIP
	Oof.
	MORGAN ANDERSON
	Earlier this week, we asked our
	help what Mr. Shirley might like
	for supper. So the boys in the
	kitchen whipped up a special menu
	in honor of our guest.
	Don, I do hope you enjoy it! Dig
	in, everyone!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thank you...thank you. We will
	return after a brief intermission.
	MORGAN ANDERSON (O.S.)
	Excuse me, Don!
	Lovely work in there!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thank you.
	MORGAN ANDERSON
	Are you looking for the commode?
	Here, let me help you.
	It’s right out there ‘fore the
	pines.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’d rather not use that.
	MORGAN ANDERSON
	Don’t be silly, Don. It looks a lot
	worse from the outside.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I understand. But I’m not going in
	there.
	I could go back and use the
	facilities at my motel, but...
	that’s going to take at least a
	half an hour.
	MORGAN ANDERSON
	LIP
	Why don’t I just pull over--you can
	piss in the woods?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Animals go in the woods.
	LIP
	But it’s twenty minutes if we go
	back to your motel.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	So let’s just get there so I can go
	back and finish the show.
	LIP
	Ayyyy. See, that’s the difference
	between you and me. I’d have zero
	problem goin’ in the woods.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’m aware.
	LIP
	Why you sore at me? I don’t make
	the rules down here.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	No? Who does?
	LIP
	Ay are you sayin’ that just ‘cause
	I’m white and they’re white?
	That’s a very prejudice thing you
	just said there, a very prejudice
	thing. I got more in common with
	the hymies at Second Avenue Deli
	than I got with these hillbilly
	pricks down here.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Eyes on the road.
	LIP
	You know, you always say that when
	you don’t like what I’m saying.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Eyes on the road.
	LIP
	How does he smile and shake their
	hands like that? If they tried to
	pull that outhouse shit with me,
	I’d piss right on their dining room
	floor.
	GEORGE
	Don’t do that...
	OLEG
	We have many concert dates left.
	LIP
	Yeah...?
	OLEG
	You realize we are contractually
	obliged to play them?
	LIP
	Of course I do. If he don’t play
	‘em, I don’t get paid. What’s your
	point?
	OLEG
	Ugly circumstances are going to
	happen again... so control yourself.
	Lip kicks his cigarette out in the dirt.
	LIP
	Don’t lecture me, you rat.
	OLEG
	Dr. Shirley could’ve stayed up
	north getting rear-end kissed at
	Park Avenue parties for three times
	money, but he asked for this.
	LIP
	Why?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	What on God’s green earth are you
	doing?
	LIP
	A letter.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Looks more like a piecemeal ransom
	note.
	May I?
	“Dear, Dolores--I’m meeting all the
	highly leading citizens of the
	town, people who use big words, all
	of them, but you know me, I get by,
	I’m a good bullshitter.”
	Two “t”s in “bullshitter.”
	“As I’m writing this letter, I’m
	eating potato chips and I’m
	starting to get thirsty. I washed
	my socks last night and dried them
	on the TV. I should have brung the
	iron.”
	Tell me what you’re trying to say.
	LIP
	I don’t know. Just... you know, how
	I miss her and shit.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Then tell her that. But try to say
	it in a manner that no one has ever
	said it.
	LIP
	Shit...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	And without profanity.
	Put this down. “Dolores, when I
	think of you, I’m reminded of the
	beautiful plains of Iowa.”
	Put it down.
	LIP
	(repeating)
	“When-I-think-of-you-I’m-remindedof-the-beautiful...”
	Lip looks up.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	LIP
	What planes?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	The plains. P-L-A-I-N-S. Those big
	fields we saw.
	LIP
	Oh, those were nice.
	“...plains of Iowa--which is what
	they call big fields around here.”
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Tony, no expounding.
	LIP
	No what?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Just write what I say.
	“The distance between us is
	breaking my spirit... My time and
	experiences without you are
	meaningless to me.”
	LIP
	“...Are meaningless to me.”
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Now this... “Falling in love with
	you was the easiest thing I have
	ever done.”
	LIP
	“Falling in love with you was the
	easiest thing...”
	This is very fucking romantic.
	LIP (V.O.)
	Nothing matters but you. I am the
	luckiest man alive, and every
	moment I am without you, I realize
	this.
	LIP (V.O.)
	I loved you the day I met you, I
	love you today...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Is it okay if I say, “P.S., kiss
	the kids”?
	A P.S.?
	LIP
	Yeah, at the end.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	That’s like clanging a cowbell at
	the end of Shostakovich’s 7th.
	LIP
	So it’s okay?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	It’s perfect, Tony.
	LIP
	That guy looks just like you, Doc.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	He does?
	LIP
	Size-wise.
	Go in and try it on. What, you
	always gotta wear a tux on stage?
	Mix it up a little.
	LIP
	We want to try on that suit in the
	window.
	TAILOR
	Of course.
	Dressing room’s in the back, sir.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thanks. I’ll just be a moment.
	LIP
	Take your time. I’ll check out some
	ties for ya.
	The Tailor REACTS, follows Shirley toward the dressing room.
	TAILOR
	Uh, excuse me, you’re not allowed
	to try that on.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I beg your pardon?
	TAILOR
	If you would like to purchase it
	first, we’ll be happy to tailor it
	to your needs.
	LIP
	Yeah...
	POLICEMAN #1
	Come on...
	POLICEMAN #1
	This is him.
	LIP
	Can you give the guy a towel, for
	Chrissakes?
	POLICEMAN #2
	You a lawyer?
	No.
	POLICEMAN #2
	Well you should call one. We’re
	taking your Auntie in.
	LIP
	For what?
	POLICEMAN #1
	Manager caught him and the other
	guy...
	LIP
	Can’t we get the cuffs off him, let
	him put his pants on?
	POLICEMAN #1
	Sure we can. But we ain’t.
	LIP
	Look, we’re out of here in the
	morning, you’ll never see us again.
	There’s gotta be a way to work this
	out.
	What if, uh, you let him go, and I
	give you something to thank you?
	POLICEMAN #1
	You bribing us?
	LIP
	No, no... a thank you.
	POLICEMAN #1
	What kind of thank you?
	LIP
	Like... a donation to the police
	force. To you guys. Whatever you
	want.
	You like suits?
	I was walking through your nice
	town today, I saw a store that was
	selling suits. Nice suits.
	How about, as a thank you--a
	donation--I buy you guys each a
	suit? You get dressed up nice, take
	your wives out to dinner. Guys like
	you, you deserve it.
	The two Policemen glance at each other.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	They were wrong for the way they
	treated me, and you rewarded them.
	LIP
	I was hired to make sure you get
	from one show to the next. How I do
	it shouldn’t matter to you.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I just wish you hadn’t paid them
	off.
	LIP
	I did what I had to do. You know,
	if this got out it would kill your
	career.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Okay, Tony, quit your phony
	altruism and concern for my career.
	LIP
	What the hell does that mean?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You were only thinking about
	yourself back there, because you
	know if I miss a show, it comes out
	of your pocket.
	LIP
	Of course I don’t want you to miss
	a show, you ungrateful bastard! You
	think I’m doing this for my
	health?! Tonight I saved your ass,
	so show a little appreciation.
	Besides, I told you never to go
	nowhere without me!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I assumed you would want this to be
	the exception.
	Lip gets in the car without opening Shirley’s door. Shirley
	stands alone a moment, then opens his own door.
	LIP
	Should I try to find you some makeup or somethin’ before the show?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I’m fine.
	LIP
	You sure?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I said I’m fine.
	MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
	Tony Lip!
	LIP
	Dominic. The hell you doin’ here?
	WISEGUY #1
	Brooklyn sent us down to take care
	of a few things.
	DOMINIC
	Who’s the eggplant?
	LIP (O.S.)
	I’m working for him.
	DOMINIC
	What’d you lose a bet?
	What’s wrong with you? You need
	work, you come to me! I’ll always
	find work for you. Matter of fact, I
	can use you this week. Gotta hit a
	few joints, straighten some people
	out--you’ll make some real money.
	LIP
	I’m making money.
	Whatever he’s paying you, I’ll
	double it.
	LIP
	This isn’t the place to talk about
	it.
	DOMINIC
	Meet me in the bar at eight o’clock
	sharp. Forget this guy.
	WISEGUY #1
	I just called his room. He’ll be
	down in a minute.
	LIP
	Oh. Hey. Just... downstairs. For a
	drink.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	To meet your friend, Dominic?
	Before you decide whether or not to
	take him up on the job offer, I
	think we should have a word.
	Tony, I think you’re doing a
	wonderful job.
	So I would like to formally offer
	you the position of my road
	manager. With the title comes more
	responsibility and, of course,
	there will be a raise in pay.
	LIP
	No, thanks.
	You and me, we agreed on a hundred
	and twenty-five a week, plus
	expenses. That’s our deal. I ain’t
	goin’ nowhere, Doc. I’m just goin’
	down to tell ‘em.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Tony...
	Sorry about last night.
	LIP
	Don’t sweat it. I been workin’
	nightclubs in the city my whole
	life...I know it’s a complicated
	world.
	LIP
	So, how’d you learn how to play so
	good, Doc?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	My mother. She taught me how to
	play on an old spinet. Soon as I
	could walk, we’d travel around the
	Florida panhandle and I’d put on
	little shows in parishes and halls.
	A man who had seen me play arranged
	for me to study at the Leningrad
	Conservatory of Music.
	LIP
	So that’s where they taught you all
	them songs you play?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Actually, I was trained to play
	classical music. Brahms, Franz
	Liszt, Chopin--it’s all I ever
	wanted to play.
	(smile fades)
	But I was persuaded by my record
	company to pursue a career in
	popular music instead. They told me
	audiences would never accept a
	black pianist on the classical
	stage. Wanted to turn me into just
	another “colored entertainer.” You
	know, the guy who smokes while he’s
	playing, who puts a glass of whisky
	on the piano and then gets mad when
	he’s not respected like Arthur
	Rubinstein. Well, you don’t see
	Arthur Rubenstein smoking and
	putting a drink on his piano.
	LIP
	Personally, if you stuck to that
	classic stuff I think it would’ve
	been a big mistake.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	A mistake? Performing the music I
	trained my entire life to play?
	LIP
	Trained? What are you, a seal?
	Anyone can sound like Beethoven or
	Joe Pan or them other guys you
	said. But your music, what you do,
	only you can do, and nobody can
	train for that.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thank you, Tony.
	But...not everyone can play
	Chopin...not the way I can.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	“...The trees have shed their leafy
	clothing and the colors have faded
	to grays and browns, but my heart
	bursts with reds and blues and
	greens from the love I hold inside
	for you...”
	DOLORES
	“It’s getting colder as we travel,
	but the country is still beautiful.
	I saw millions of trees, all dusted
	with snow, just like out of a fairytale...”
	Lynn and Fran are enthralled.
	LYNN
	He’s so expressive.
	DOLORES
	“We’ve only a few more shows before
	our Christmas concert in
	Birmingham, Alabama on the 23rd. I
	will count the hours, minutes, and
	seconds until you are in my arms. I
	love and miss you more than I can
	explain. Tony. P.S.--Kiss the
	kids.”
	LOUIE
	Gotta admit, Lip’s letters--they’re
	not bad.
	RUDY
	Well, it’s in the family. They say
	we had a great, great, great
	grandfather helped Da Vinci with
	the Sixteen Chapel.
	JOHNNY
	You mean Michelangelo.
	RUDY
	Right. And that’s a true story,
	right, Pop?
	JOHNNY
	What the hell’s that got to do with
	writin’ letters?
	RUDY
	I’m just sayin’, we’re an arty
	family.
	FRANCES
	John, I want a letter.
	JOHNNY
	Yeah, soon as you make a meal...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Tony...
	TUXEDO MAN
	Let’s give a fine Louisiana welcome
	to Don Shirley and the Don Shirley
	Trio!
	LIP
	Your mother’s ass...
	‘Hell’s this guy doin’?
	PATROLMAN #1
	License and papers?
	LIP
	Glad to see you guys. I’m a little
	lost.
	PATROLMAN #1
	Step out of the car.
	LIP
	In the rain? What I do?
	PATROLMAN #1
	Out of the car.
	Why you on this road?
	LIP
	I told you, I had to detour and I’m
	lost. We’re not from around here.
	PATROLMAN #1
	No, you ain’t. So I’m gonna ask you
	again... what the hell you doin’
	out here?
	And why you driving him?
	LIP
	He’s my boss.
	PATROLMAN #1
	He can’t be out here at night. This
	is a sundown town.
	LIP
	What’s that mean?
	PATROLMAN #1
	Get him out of the car. Check his
	I.D.
	LIP
	Come on, it’s pouring.
	PATROLMAN #2
	I can just get it through the
	window.
	PATROLMAN #1
	Get him out the goddamn car!
	PATROLMAN #2
	Out.
	PATROLMAN #1
	What’s this last name say?
	LIP
	Vallelonga.
	PATROLMAN #1
	‘Hell kind of name is that?
	LIP
	Italian.
	PATROLMAN #1
	Oh, now I get it. That’s why you
	driving this boy around... you half
	a nigger yourself.
	Hands in the air, now!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Excuse me!
	Excuse me, sirs. I quite understand
	why my associate is being held, but
	what exactly am I being charged
	with?
	You seem like reasonable men--can
	you let me out so we might discuss
	the situation please?
	PATROLMAN #1
	Put the apple butter away, boy--you
	ain’t goin’ nowhere no time soon.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You cannot hold me without cause!
	PATROLMAN #1
	I got cause. ‘Cause you let the sun
	set on your black ass!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I want to speak to a lawyer, I want
	my phone call! This is a flagrant
	violation of my rights! I demand my
	phone call immediately!
	PATROLMAN #2
	He does have...rights.
	POLICE CHIEF
	Give the negra his goddamn call.
	PATROLMAN #1
	You know a lawyer? Call him.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	As my mother always said, “What
	kind of brand new fool are you?!”
	Look out there, Tony. Take a good
	look at the officer you hit.
	Look at him.
	He’s having a grand old time,
	chatting up his pals, having a nice
	cup of coffee. And where are you?
	In here. With me. Who did nothing.
	Yet I’m the one who’s paying the
	price. I’m the one who’s going to
	miss the Birmingham show.
	LIP
	Hey, I’m losin’ a lot of money,
	too, if you don’t play Birmingham.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	So your little temper tantrum...was
	it worth it?
	You don’t win with violence, Tony,
	you win when you maintain your
	dignity. Dignity always prevails.
	And tonight, because of you, we did
	not.
	PATROLMAN #2
	Mayersville Po-lice.
	No, sir. Not me, sir. Yes, sir,
	he’s right here, sir.
	He holds the phone out to the Chief.
	POLICE CHIEF
	What?
	Chief Pratt--who’s this?
	Bull-oney.
	Okay, yes, now I hear it, Governor.
	I’m sorry. Yes, of course I
	recognize your voice.
	I-I’m sorry, you sayin’ the boy we
	got locked up called who, sir?
	And he called you?
	But an officer was assaulted in the
	line of...
	No, no, I don’t want no National
	Guard down here, neither, sir.
	Yes, Governor, immediately. And
	good night to you and the missus.
	Let ‘em go.
	PATROLMAN #1
	What?!
	POLICE CHIEF
	Cut ‘em loose, goddamnit!
	PATROLMAN #1 (O.S.)
	But that dago-wop hit me!
	POLICE CHIEF (O.S.)
	Now!
	LIP
	Who the hell’d you call?
	LIP
	Bobby Kennedy just saved our asses!
	Maddon...How great is that?!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	It’s not great--it’s not great at
	all--it’s humiliating.
	LIP
	‘The hell you talking about? We
	were screwed and now we ain’t.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	And I just put the Attorney General
	of the United States in an
	incredibly awkward position.
	LIP
	So what? That’s what the guy gets
	paid for. What else he got to do?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	That man and his brother are trying
	to change this country--that’s what
	else he’s got to do! Now he thinks
	I’m garbage. Calling from some
	backwoods swamp jail, asking if he
	can help attenuate assault charges...
	who does that? Garbage, that’s who.
	You shouldn’t have hit him!
	LIP
	I didn’t like the way he was
	treating you, making you stand out
	in the rain.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Please. You hit him because of what
	he called you. I’ve had to listen
	to that kind of talk my entire
	life, you should be able to take it
	for one night.
	LIP
	What, I can’t get mad when he says
	that stuff ‘cause I’m not black?
	Christ, I’m blacker than you.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You’re blacker than me?
	LIP
	You don’t know shit about your own
	people! What they eat, how they
	talk, how they live--you don’t even
	know who Lil’ Richard is!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	So knowing who Little Richard is
	makes you blacker than me? I wish
	you could hear yourself sometimes,
	Tony--you wouldn’t talk as much.
	LIP
	Bullshit! I know exactly who I am.
	I’m the guy who’s lived on the same
	block in the same Bronx my entire
	life, with my mother and father and
	my brother, and now my wife and
	kids. That’s it--that’s who I am.
	I’m the asshole who’s gotta hustle
	every goddamn day to put food on my
	table. You? Mr. Big Shot? You
	travel around the world and live on
	top of a castle and do concerts for
	rich people! I live on the streets,
	you sit on a throne--so yeah, my
	world is way more blacker than
	yours!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Pull over.
	LIP
	What?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Pull! Over!
	LIP
	I ain’t pullin’ over!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Stop the car!
	LIP
	What are you doin’?!
	Get back in the car!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Yes, I live in a castle! Alone. And
	rich white folks let me play piano
	for them, because it makes them
	feel cultured. But when I walk off
	that stage I go right back to being
	another nigger to them--because
	that is their true culture. And I
	suffer that slight alone, because
	I’m not accepted by my own people,
	because I’m not like them either!
	So if I’m not black enough, and I’m
	not white enough, and I’m not man
	enough, what am I?!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I need sleep.
	LIP
	Okay, I’ll pull over at the next
	place we see and I’ll sneak you
	into my room.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	No. No. I refuse to stay at an
	establishment that doesn’t want me.
	LIP
	Okay.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You realize you’re going to be home
	before that letter gets there?
	LIP
	Yeah, I was gonna just bring it
	with me. Save on stamps.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Give it here, I’ll fix it.
	LIP
	No offense, Doc, but I think I got
	the hang of it.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	“Dear Dolores, sometimes you remind
	me of a house.”
	”A house with beautiful lights on
	it where everyone inside is happy.”
	Yeah, you got it.
	LIP
	Doc...
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Yes?
	LIP
	Thanks for helping me with the
	letters--you’re really good at
	writin’ ‘em.
	Maybe when you get home you should
	write one to your brother?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	He knows where I am if he wants to
	reconnect.
	LIP
	Don’t wait for him, Doc. This I
	know...the world’s full of lonely
	people afraid to make the first
	move.
	You know, something’s been eating
	at me the whole trip.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Hmmm?
	LIP
	That Tittsburgh was a real
	disappointment. I didn’t notice any
	difference at all.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Good night, Tony.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Welcome, Mr. Shirley! Graham
	Kindell, I’m the general manager.
	So nice to meet y’all!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thank you, Mr. Kindell. This is
	Tony Vallelonga.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Pleasure, Tony. Right this way.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	If you need anything--anything
	t’all--you let me know.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Thank you.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Here you are. We have about an hour
	before show time. Any questions?
	LIP
	Where’s the restaurant?
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Continue down the hall, Tony, to
	the right, across the lobby.
	LIP
	We’ve got an hour. I’m starving.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Go ahead. I’ll meet you there.
	GEORGE
	Tony!
	LIP
	Shirley’ll be here in a minute.
	BIRMINGHAM WAITER
	Cocktails, gentlemen?
	OLEG
	Three shots vodka.
	Last show. Cold war over. Time for
	truce.
	GEORGE
	Is Shirley in his dressing room?
	LIP
	More like a broom closet. I don’t
	understand why he puts up with this
	shit.
	OLEG
	Six years ago, 1956, Nat King Cole
	was invited to perform at Municipal
	Auditorium right here in
	Birmingham. Mr. Cole was very first
	negro asked to play at a white
	establishment in this city.
	Soon as Mr. Cole started playing, a
	group of men attacked him for
	playing white people’s music.
	Pulled him off stage and beat him
	badly.
	You asked once why Dr. Shirley does
	this? I tell you. Because there is
	no genius without courage.
	LIP
	What’s the problem?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	This gentleman’s saying I can’t
	dine here.
	LIP
	No, you don’t understand, this
	guy’s playing here tonight--he’s
	the main event.
	MAITRE D’
	I’m sorry. It’s the policy of the
	restaurant.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Everything all right?
	LIP
	No, it’s not all right. Dr.
	Shirley’s being told he can’t eat
	here.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	I apologize, but these are... longstanding traditions. I’m sure you
	understand.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	No. I don’t. In 45 minutes I’ll be
	entertaining your guests up on that
	stage, but I can’t eat here?
	Graham Kindell shifts uncomfortably.
	LIP
	Wait a minute. You’re tellin’ me
	the bozos in his band, and the
	shlubs that came to see him play
	can eat here, but the star can’t?
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	I’m afraid not.
	LIP
	Well he’s gotta eat. Can you at
	least bring him food from the
	restaurant to his dressing room?
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Of course. We’ll be happy to send
	him anything he would like.
	John, show him a menu.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	No. I’m not eating in a dressing
	room.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Okay... if you’d prefer, there’s a
	very popular establishment right
	down the road--the Orange Bird--
	they’ll be happy to feed you.
	LIP
	Food’s probably better there anyway
	--the dinner rolls here are like
	rocks. Come on, we can be back in
	45 minutes.
	Doc, it’s the last show. Let’s just
	get through this and we can go home
	and get away from all these
	assholes.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	No. Not this time. I’m eating in
	this room or I’m not playing.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	May I have a word with you?
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Mr. Villanueva, you have to talk
	sense to Mr. Shirley. Please
	explain that we’re not insulting
	him personally, this is just the
	way things are done down here.
	LIP
	Yeah, well he ain’t from down here.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Just ask him to be reasonable. I
	have 400 guests out there who
	expect to be entertained tonight.
	LIP
	And Dr. Shirley expects to eat
	tonight. Why can’t you just make an
	exception this one time?
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Lemme tell you a story. You ever
	hear of the Boston Celtics
	basketball club? Those boys came
	through here a couple years ago on
	a barnstorming tour. Now, seeing as
	they were World Champions of the
	league and all, we was tickled to
	have ‘em eat here and we rolled out
	the welcome wagon. So you know what
	table their big coon ate at that
	night?
	LIP
	No.
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	I don’t either. But it wasn’t one
	of ours.
	Now let’s cut the bullshit. Tell me
	what it’s gonn’ take.
	Say one hundred dollars and you get
	your boy to play?
	LIP
	You think you can buy me?
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	All do respect, sir, but you
	wouldn’t be doing a job like this
	if you couldn’t be bought.
	DR. SHIRLEY (O.S.)
	Stop!
	It’s all right, Tony. I’ll play...
	if you want me to.
	LIP
	Nah, let’s get the fuck outta here.
	CUT TO:
	GRAHAM KINDELL
	Don, don’t do this!
	We have a contract, and I know
	you’re the kind of man that honors
	a contract!
	You got a show to do, mister!
	DR. SHIRLEY
	You hungry?
	ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
	You a cop?
	LIP
	I look Irish?
	ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
	What you want, baby?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Two Cutty’s, neat.
	ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
	Comin’ up.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Whatever your specialty is, we’ll
	take it.
	ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
	Two orange birds!
	LIP
	I like what you did back there,
	Doc. You stood up for yourself.
	It’s like your friend the President
	says -- “Don’t ask what your
	country can do for you, ask what
	you can do for yourself.”
	ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
	So, darlin’, what you do, all
	dressed up like that?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Nothing important.
	LIP
	He’s only the greatest piano player
	in the world.
	ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
	That right? You good?
	LIP
	Don’t be shy, Doc. Tell her who you
	are.
	ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
	Don’t tell me nothin’--show me.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	If we leave right now, I think you
	can make it.
	LIP
	Make what?
	DR. SHIRLEY
	Christmas Eve.
	LIP
	Don’t ever flash a wad of cash in a
	bar.
	DR. SHIRLEY
	I knew you had a gun!
	LIP
