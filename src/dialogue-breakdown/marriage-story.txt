CHARLIE
What I love about Nicole...
She makes people feel comfortable
about even embarrassing things. She really listens when someone is
talking...
NICOLE
I do.
CHARLIE
...sometimes she listens TOO
much, for too long-- She’s
a good citizen.
She always knows the right thing
to do when it comes to difficult
family shit.
NICOLE
Just call him.
CHARLIE
No.
NICOLE 
Call him.
CHARLIE
No.
NICOLE
Call him.
CHARLIE
I get stuck in my ways and she
knows when to push me and when to
leave me alone.
She cuts all our hair.
She’s always inexplicably brewing
a cup of tea that she doesn’t
drink.
And it’s not easy for her to put
away a sock, or close a cabinet,
or do a dish, but she tries for
me.
Nicole grew up in LA around actors
and directors and movies and TV
and is very close to her mother,
Sandra, and, Cassie, her sister.
Nicole gives great presents. She
is a mother who plays -- really
plays -- she never steps off
playing or says it’s too much (and
it must be too much some of the
time).
HENRY
Arrrh, waaa, urgh...
NICOLE
Arrgh--
HENRY
No, he’s dead.
NICOLE
My guy is dead?
HENRY
He’s dead but you can use this
guy.
NICOLE
Arrrhhggg--
CHARLIE
She’s competitive.
NICOLE
Goddammit! I was just IN jail!
NICOLE
Do NOT laugh at me. I’m serious.
Do NOT LAUGH AT ME!
CHARLIE
She’s a great dancer. Infectious.
She makes me wish I could dance.
She always says when she doesn’t
know something or hasn’t read a
book or seen a film or a play
(whereas I fake it or say
something like, “I haven’t seen it
in a while.”) She keeps the
fridge over-full. No one is ever
hungry in our house. She can
drive a stick.
She’s amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms, which
I’ve always found very sexy.
NICOLE
You might as well get what you
paid for!
CHARLIE
She’s brave. After that movie,
All Over The Girl, she could have
stayed in LA and been a movie
star, but she gave that up to do
theater with me in New York.
My crazy ideas are her favorite
things to figure out how to
execute.
Try it crawling but also standing.
She’s my favorite actress.
NICOLE
What I love about Charlie...
Charlie is undaunted. He never
lets other people’s opinions or
any set-backs keep him from what
he wants to do.
Charlie eats like he’s trying to
get it over with and like there
won’t be enough food for everyone.
A sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured. But he’s
incredibly neat and I rely on him
to keep things in order.
CHARLIE
Sorry.
NICOLE
He’s energy conscious.
He turns them back on.
NICOLE
He doesn’t look in the mirror too
often. He cries easily in movies.
HENRY
I cried four times.
CHARLIE
Me too. I wonder if it was the
same four.
NICOLE
He is very self-sufficient -- he
can darn a sock and cook himself
dinner and iron a shirt.
HENRY
The peppers are cut!
NICOLE
He rarely gets defeated (which I
feel like I always do).
Charlie takes all of my moods
steadily, he doesn’t give in to
them or make me feel bad about
them. He’s a great dresser, he
never looks embarrassing which is
hard for a man.
He’s very competitive.
He double faults.
CHARLIE
Goddammit Charlie! Get it
together.
HENRY
I had a bad dream.
NICOLE
He loves being a dad, he loves all
the things you’re supposed to
hate, like the tantrums, the
waking up at night.
It’s almost annoying how much he
likes it, but then it’s mostly
nice.
NICOLE
He disappears into his own world.
He and Henry are alike in that
way.
CHARLIE
Shit!
HENRY
What’s “shit?”
CHARLIE
That was our stop!
He can tell people they have food
in their teeth or on their face in
a way that doesn’t make them feel
bad.
NICOLE
Charlie is self-made -- his
parents -- I only met them once --
but he told me there was a lot of
alcohol and some violence in his
childhood.
He moved to New York from Indiana
with no safety net and now he’s
more a New Yorker than any New
Yorker.
He’s brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.
CHARLIE
I made sure they used the
right almond milk--
NICOLE
With the theatre company he
cast a spell that made
everyone feel included. No
one, not even an intern was
unimportant. He could
remember all the inside
jokes.
CHARLIE
And where do YOU go when it’s
windy?!
YOUNG INTERN
Oh yeah, that was funny!
CHARLIE
Let’s stop there.
MEDIATOR
Who wants to start?
NICOLE
I’m not going to read this out
loud.
MEDIATOR
Why is that?
NICOLE
I don’t like what I wrote.
MEDIATOR
As we mediate your separation and
eventual divorce, things can
become quite contentious, so I
like to begin with a note of
positivity. For the people I work
with to remember why they got
married in the first place. And
so, that as you come apart, you’re
reminded that this is a person you
had great feeling for and maybe
still do in many ways--
CHARLIE
I’ll read mine. I like what I
wrote.
MEDIATOR
For it to really work, you both
have to read--
NICOLE
I’m not going to.
MEDIATOR
OK--
CHARLIE
She always says I can’t
write. But I think mine is
pretty good.
MEDIATOR
Nicole, maybe you’ll change your
mind once you hear Charlie’s.
NICOLE
I don’t want to hear Charlie’s.
CHARLIE
We promised to listen.
MEDIATOR
That’s right, that’s the very
first step in this process.
Nicole stands up, suddenly furious.
NICOLE
Well, I think I’ll go if you two
are just going to sit around and
suck each other’s dicks!
MARY ANN
Do you think I can go over there
now?
DONNA
Not yet.
FRANK
...Charlie gave me the note - but
it’s really for you: he told me to
pick up my cues.
TERRY
How is that for me?
FRANK
Acting is reacting - I’m
responding to you and you’re
slowing ME down.
ACTOR 3
...hey, hello, Frank - it’s
closing night, you know, we’re
done?!
LIGHTING TECH
...first, no, we’re moving
to
The BroadWAYTERRY
To The BroadWAY!
FRANK
The Main Stem.
ACTOR 2
...but we’ll have to restage
it anyway!
FRANK
...it’s still a good note...
ACTOR 1
...and you know Charlie, it’s
never done, he never finishes.
ACTOR 3
We NEVER FINISH!
ACTOR 2
Love you, Charlie.
TERRY
I need a cigarette.
BETH
...that’s why it seems wrong to
take over for Nicole - the role is
hers! And what if her pilot
doesn’t go, she’ll come back from
LA and want the part back, right?
ACTOR 3
No, she’s done with it.
BETH
Something like 100 percent
of pilots don’t get picked
up.
ACTOR 4
It can’t be 100 percent. There
would never be any shows.
ACTOR 5
No, but statistically, it’s
true. The probability is
zero. It’s one of those
things.
BETH
You don’t think Charlie and
Nicole will ever get back
together?
ACTOR 3
No, this time it’s really over.
BETH
Still feels weird...
ACTOR 9
...I feel like MY parents
are splitting up.
ACTOR 7
It’s always been “Charlie
and Nicole.” It just
doesn’t sound right any
other way.
ACTOR 3
Poor Henry.
MARY ANN
How about now?
DONNA
I’d wait, honey.
ANOTHER ACTOR
He still giving notes?
TERRY
Yep.
SET DESIGNER
You’re lucky, Nic, I wish I was
going to LA. You can have space
in LA. There’s no SPACE here.
MARY ANN
Now?
DONNA
Don’t do it.
FRANK
Winning your first Tony at 27--
which I did--messes with your
head. I was just a baby! Elia
Kazan came backstage on opening
night elbowing Mike Nichols into a
corner. Mike, who I later turned
down twice, a big regret of
mine...
MARY ANN
I wanted to make sure that I have
all your notes down so I can
compile them into the master list
for when we move into the new
theater...
BABYSITTER
Oh hey, I didn’t expect you guys
until late.
NICOLE
How’s he doing?
BABYSITTER
Good, good. He went to bed on
time, no fuss. I read him some of
Cricket in Times Square...
God, you guys are so attractive.
Shit, sorry. I didn’t stop that
from being said.
CHARLIE
Ha! No it’s okay. I’ll pay
you for the whole time, we
decided to come home early.
BABYSITTER
Hey, thanks! And also the
travel time to Greenpoint--
CHARLIE
It’s not always going to be like
this, it’s going to get better.
Nicole nods.
CHARLIE
If you don’t like that mediator,
we’ll find another one--
NICOLE
Yeah...
CHARLIE
We might not need a
mediator, we’ll just split
everything anyway, I don’t
care--
NICOLE
Me neither--
CHARLIE
You can have most of it.
CHARLIE
We’ll get apartments near
each other, make it easier
for Henry--
NICOLE
Right.
CHARLIE
We’ll figure it out. We want the
same things.
Nicole meets Charlie’s eye. He hesitates.
CHARLIE
In the meantime, the pilot will be
fun for you.
NICOLE
You don’t think it’s bad, do you?
CHARLIE
I don’t ever watch TV so, you
know, I can’t tell...
NICOLE
Uh huh.
CHARLIE
I told Henry I’ll come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.
NICOLE
Yes?
CHARLIE
Nothing.
NICOLE
I can tell you want to give me a
note.
CHARLIE
No, I don’t... Yeah, I mean, yes I
do. But I guess, I guess it
doesn’t matter now. You won’t be
with the show anymore. It’s
stupid.
NICOLE
You’re not going to be able to go
to sleep until you tell me.
CHARLIE
Maybe not.
NICOLE
Okay then.
CHARLIE
Well, yes, okay, but just because
saying it out loud might help me
remember it for later.
NICOLE
Sure.
CHARLIE
So - there were two things -
I thought your posture at
the top of scene seven was
still too dignified...
NICOLE
--okay--
CHARLIE
--and then at the end, I could
tell that you were pushing for the
emotion--
17.
NICOLE
--you know I can’t cry on stage
and I know you don’t like when I
fake it, but I thought maybe it
would come tonight. But it
didn’t...
CHARLIE
That’s all I had. Thanks for
indulging me.
NICOLE
Goodnight Charlie.
FEMALE VOICE
“This is the day, this is the
day...”
SANDRA
“That the Lord has made, that the
Lord has made...”
SANDRA
“Let us rejoice, let us rejoice.
And be glad in it and be glad in
it...”
NICOLE
Mom...
HENRY
G-ma summer is for relaxing.
SANDRA
You can’t make home too nice,
otherwise your children will never
leave--
NICOLE
What do you want to do today?
HENRY
Hang out and relax with you.
NICOLE
Me too.
SANDRA
No relaxing! Nicole has a hair
and make-up test and Henry, we got
you into Fairy Camp with the
cousins.
HENRY
I hate Fairy Camp.
SANDRA
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy
Camp and I think this is true.
Sandra kisses Henry on the head.
SANDRA
Henry, go make your mom some
coffee like I taught you--
HENRY
Mom, wait till you taste my
coffee.
SANDRA
Do you always sleep together?
Even in New York?
NICOLE
It’s just for now, while we go
through this transition. Shit,
don’t tell Charlie when he gets
here -- he hates co-sleeping.
Nicole climbs out of bed. Her pillow is stained with black
eye make-up.
SANDRA
Well, I have to say, I agree with
Charlie.
NICOLE
Surprise, surprise.
SANDRA
It’s as if you’ve exploded
into this room.
NICOLE
Jesus, it’s early.
NICOLE
I can do this part alone?
SANDRA
That’s fine. I won’t look.
SANDRA
As long as you’re in my house,
wake up is at 6:30 AM. And until
you know what you want to do,
we’re going to do what I like to
do.
NICOLE
I can’t just go from what Charlie
wanted to do to what you want to
do.
20.
SANDRA
Even though I’m sixty-four and
have a dead gay husband, I manage
to get up everyday and live my
life and feel pretty good about
myself so maybe your Mom knows a
thing or two.
SANDRA
You know what I would do?
NICOLE
About what?
SANDRA
When Charlie gets here, I would
whisk him off to Palm Springs?
That’s what your father and I did
whenever we hit a speed bump--
NICOLE
Didn’t you walk in on Dad
blowing the porter in Palm
Springs?
SANDRA
And I always regretted
getting so upset about it.
NICOLE
Charlie and I are getting a
divorce, Mom. There’s nothing for
us in Palm Springs.
SANDRA
YOU NEED TO WASH YOUR FACE BEFORE
YOU GO TO SLEEP.
HENRY
When Daddy gets here maybe we can
all go on the Jaws ride--
NICOLE
Yeah--
HENRY
Or I can go once with you
and once with Daddy because
I wouldn’t mind going twice
anyway--
SANDRA
Did you know Universal
Studios is where I did my
first screen test--
NICOLE
No, we’ll all go together,
sweetheart.
NICOLE
On the plane, I re-read the pilot
as if I were Charlie reading it
and I started to think it’s just
bad.
SANDRA
My agent says it’s “one to watch.”
She sips her coffee.
NICOLE
This coffee IS good. Thank you.
What if Charlie’s on Broadway with
the play I brought him--which I
originated and I’m just doing bad
TV.
SANDRA
It doesn’t matter. Everyone is
only impressed when they see
someone on TV.
DIRECTOR
Where’s she been for the past ten
years?
MALE PRODUCER
Doing weird theater in New
York.
FEMALE PRODUCER
She looks great.
NICOLE
Can I say something?
No one answers. We hear bits of side-conversations about a
book club book they’re all reading.
MALE PRODUCER
Downtown shit. I saw one. It
rained on stage.
DP
Plays make me uncomfortable.
MALE PRODUCER
It was good. Edgy.
Directed by her husband.
Supposedly very controlling.
DP
The live aspect--
FEMALE PRODUCER
We’re lucky to have her.
DIRECTOR
I’m surprised she said yes.
FEMALE PRODUCER
We can thank her divorce.
EFFECTS GUY
Can she move her hand? It’s going
to be hard to roto the hair in on
the baby around her fingers--
MALE PRODUCER
Can you move your hand further
down the baby?
NICOLE
What do you mean? Like down here?
DIRECTOR
Off his head entirely--
NICOLE
I’d need to support his
head.
DIRECTOR 
No, no, support the head, of
course, just try to do it from the
shoulders?
Perfect.
NICOLE
I can’t hold a baby like this.
FEMALE PRODUCER
She’s right, that’s going to
look weird.
EFFECTS GUY
Just so you know, we can
TOTALLY do it, it’s just
going to take time and money
and mean less hair.
GRIP
So we can see your pretty face.
And not ours.
NICOLE
Ha. You should have seen me
before the plants invaded.
GRIP
I say that with respect. I
was raised by two mothers.
DP 
Can you lower the board
please, Pablo?
GRIP
Here? How ‘bout here?
GRIP
How about now?
MALE PRODUCER
Why is there always a flirty
grip.
GRIP
That better, boss?
MAKE-UP ARTIST
I can do ANYTHING you want,
but we’ll need to have her
two hours before call every
day we work with the plants--
Someone walks through the shot carrying an enormous plant
arm.
NICOLE
Can I say something?
FEMALE PRODUCER 
Hold on.
What honey?
NICOLE
She has to know how to hold a
baby. Later after she kills
Donny, she becomes this sort of
earth mother for the plant
community and that won’t make
sense if we think she’s a bad
mother to her own kid.
MAKE-UP ARTIST 
She kills Donny?
DIRECTOR
That’s a secret. We didn’t
give the crew those pages.
NICOLE
You don’t want her to appear
unsympathetic this early in the
show, do you?
MAKE-UP ARTIST
Does Donny know?
FEMALE PRODUCER
She’s right.
NICOLE
Also, why does she kill Donny
anyway?
MALE PRODUCER
Must be nice to get out of New
York. Our daughter, Mia is at NYU
living in a shoe box--
NICOLE
Well, I’m from out here--
MALE PRODUCER
She’s says it went up to a
hundred and four the other
day--
FEMALE PRODUCER
We’re just so excited to
have you.
NICOLE
I’m excited to be here --
MALE PRODUCER
We’re going for an early aughts
aesthetic — so having your
presence nails that.
MAKE-UP ARTIST
What signifies early aughts?
FEMALE PRODUCER
Into The Girl was on TV--
NICOLE
All Over--
FEMALE PRODUCER
--or streaming or something
and you are fucking HOT in
that movie.
MALE PRODUCER
Carol--
FEMALE PRODUCER
Fuck it, I speak my mind!
MALE PRODUCER
We’re not allowing our son to see
it.
FEMALE PRODUCER
Because you show your tits.
MALE PRODUCER
Carol--
NICOLE
Yeah.
MALE PRODUCER
This is Carter Mitchum, he’s a
futurist at UCLA who’s consulting
on all the environmental stuff for
the show.
MALE PRODUCER
You know, so it’s accurate.
CARTER
Nice to meet you.
NICOLE
So, is it?
CARTER
What?
NICOLE
Accurate?
CARTER
So far none of it.
Nicole laughs. She’s handed another nightgown by the
wardrobe assistant. “For when you’re on the mother ship.”
MALE PRODUCER
This pilot WILL go. Get ready to
move back to LA!
FEMALE PRODUCER
And listen: everything you were
saying back there was absolutely
right--
MALE PRODUCER
Except no one knows we’re
killing Donny. Including
Donny.
FEMALE PRODUCER
If she’s a bad mom, we’ll
lose the audience.
NICOLE
Oh...good, you know, I just
thought
FEMALE PRODUCER
Let us know if you’d like to be
part of our writer’s room -- I bet
you’d be really helpful.
NICOLE
Or I could direct? Sorry, maybe
that sounds crazy.
FEMALE PRODUCER
No, yeah... Do you have a reel?
NICOLE
No, because I’ve never done it. I
mean, I watched my husband do it
for years...
Almost ex-husband? What’s the
opposite of fiance?
FEMALE PRODUCER
We’ll talk to your agents about
it.
NICOLE
At our theater, I always wanted to
direct and Charlie would say
something like “The next one!”
But he was always the director and
there never was a next one.
But I don’t know, maybe there
would have been if we stayed
married. You know, I don’t know.
Nicole turns away, embarrassed. The Female Producer has
been watching her, while the Male Producer is just texting
like a motherfucker.
FEMALE PRODUCER
I’m going to give you a number.
NICOLE
Oh...OK. Is it a therapist? I
have a therapist. Well, she’s my
mom’s therapist. We share her.
FEMALE PRODUCER
She’s a lawyer, she represented me
when I left Dennis.
NICOLE
You and Dennis are divorced?
FEMALE PRODUCER
Since 2013.
NICOLE
And you still work together?
That’s nice.
FEMALE PRODUCER
Oh, no, he’s a fucking cocksucker.
Nora got me half of this project
in the settlement.
NICOLE
We talked about doing it without
lawyers.
FEMALE PRODUCER
You think that, but you
won’t...
NICOLE
My sister made me meet a
bunch of them already, I
just HATED them.
FEMALE PRODUCER
Call Nora. She saved my life.
NORA
I’m sorry I look so schleppy.
I had an event at my kid’s school.
Let me get this out of the way, I
think you’re a wonderful actress.
NICOLE
Thank you.
NORA
I loved All Over The Girl but the
theater stuff too.
NICOLE
You’ve seen the theater
stuff?
NORA
I saw Electra.
NORA
I was in New York last year for my
book -- which, remind me to give
you a copy -- and my publisher
took me.
NICOLE
Oh...great. Thank you.
NORA
Fantastic. You’re awesome.
NICOLE
Charlie directed it.
NORA
I know. He’s very talented.
NICOLE
He is. They’re moving it to
Broadway. Without me of course.
NORA
He was lucky to have you.
NICOLE
While I’m making a show
about a plant invasion.
NORA
How are you doing?
NORA
Oh, honey.
NORA
You take some breaths. And while
you do, I’m going to tell you
about myself.
NORA
If you should choose to hire me, I
will work tirelessly for you and
am always available by phone or
text, EXCEPT when I’m with my
kids. I insist on doing drop-off
and pick-up at school every day.
NICOLE
Oh, I understand.
NORA
I’ve been through this myself so I
know how it feels.
NICOLE
You do?
NORA
Yes. I have a kid from my
ex who was a narcissistic
artist and verbally abusive.
I’m now with a great
boyfriend, who lives in
Malibu.
NICOLE
Oh, good.
But Charlie’s not terrible.
NORA
No, of course not, but they ravish
you with attention in the
beginning and then once we have
babies, we become the mom and they
get sick of us.
Nicole nods.
NORA
Where do you want live now, doll?
NICOLE
Well, I’m here now, obviously, and
I don’t know if this show will be
picked up, but... it feels like
home... it is home. It’s the only
home I’ve known without Charlie.
NORA
You want to stay here.
NICOLE
Charlie won’t want to do that. He
hates LA.
NORA
We’re interested in what YOU want
to do. Sounds to me like you did
your time in New York. He can do
some time here, no?
NICOLE
He always said we would, but we
never did.
NORA
How old is your son?
NICOLE
Henry is eight. He likes LA, but
I don’t know if it’s fair to
him...
NORA
It sounds like a wonderful
childhood to me: the first half
New York and the second half in
LA.
NICOLE
The second half...
NORA
I want you to listen to me, what
you’re doing is an act of HOPE.
Do you understand that?
NICOLE
Yes.
NORA
You’re saying, I want
something better for myself.
NICOLE
I do.
NORA
And this, right now, is the
worst time. It will only
get better. Wasn’t it Tom
Petty who said the waiting
is the hardest part?
NICOLE
I don’t know.
NORA
I represented his wife in
their divorce, I got her
half of that song.
NICOLE
Oh, I don’t want money or
anything, he doesn’t have money
anyway, he puts it all back into
the theater-- I used to think he
gave TOO much away. I just want
it to be over.
NORA
Of course you do. But we can do
both.
NICOLE
I just worry... You know we
weren’t going to even use lawyers
so...I don’t want to be too
aggressive. I’d like to stay
friends.
NORA
Don’t worry, we’ll do it as gently
as possible
Now, can you tell me a little bit
more about what’s going on?
Because part of what we’re going
to do together is tell your STORY.
NICOLE
It’s difficult to articulate.
Sorry. It’s like I know why I’m
doing this but I don’t know too.
It’s not as simple as not being in
love anymore.
NORA
I understand. Why don’t you start
at the beginning, wherever that is
for you.
NICOLE
Well, I was engaged to Ben, you
know, and living in LA and I felt
like “Yes, I want to make movies
and marry Ben” - Jesus I was only
nineteen or twenty, I’ve never
felt older in my whole life - But
if I was honest with myself, there
was a small part of me that felt
dead, or dead-ish, but you tell
yourself “no one is perfect, no
relationship is perfect.”
Boy, this tea is delicious.
NORA
Isn’t it? It’s the Manuka honey.
NICOLE
Anyway, you were asking about
Charlie. So yes, so I was happy
with Ben, but aware of the
deadness.
And then I went to New York to
meet a director for a space movie,
but one where they take space
seriously. Sex trafficking in
space. It was political, or they
wanted us to think it was. It was
actually just fulfilling the same
need certain fucked up porn does.
Anyway, while I was there, the
producer invited me to a play. It
was in someone’s living room with
all the lights on and like nothing
I’d ever seen before. A strange,
surreal dystopian story. So well
acted and one of the actors was
this big shaggy bear who played
all his lines looking directly at
me which I knew couldn’t be really
the case, but it felt that way,
and of course later I learned that
it was.
The cookies are really great too.
NORA
I’ll give you some to take home.
NICOLE
Afterwards, I was introduced to the
cast and this bear turned out to
also be the director. He didn’t
really know who I was - or he did,
or he figured it out later - and
that was it. He started talking to
me. And I talked back - and the
dead part wasn’t dead, it was just
in a coma. And it was better than
sex, the talking. Although the sex
was also like the talking...
everything is like everything in a
relationship, do you find that? ...
We spent the whole night and next
day together, and I just... never
left. And to be honest, all the
problems were there in the
beginning, too. I just went along
with him in his life because it
felt so damn good to feel myself
alive. In the beginning I was the
actress, the star, so that felt
like something. People came to see
me, at first.
But then the farther away I got
from that and the more the theatre
company got acclaim, I had less and
less weight. I became “Who?” “Oh
you remember, that actress who was
in that thing that time.” And he
was the draw. And that would have
been fine, but...I got smaller. I
realized that I didn’t really ever
come alive for myself, I was just
feeding his aliveness. He was so
smart and creative, it didn’t
matter. I would tell him things at
home, in private, and then they
would work their way into public
conversation, into his work and for
a while that felt like enough. I
was just so flattered that someone
like him would find an idea of mine
worth using or a comment of mine
worth repeating. And then I got
pregnant. And I thought “having a
baby will be ours, really ours, and
it will also really be mine” and he
was so excited. And it was nice for
a while. But kids... they belong to
themselves. Like the instant they
leave your body, it’s just a
process of going away from you. And
I didn’t belong to myself. It was
stupid stuff and big stuff-- All
of the furniture in our house was
his taste. I wasn’t even sure what
my taste was anymore because I’d
never been asked to use it. I
didn’t even pick our apartment, I
just moved into his. I made noises
about wanting to move back to LA,
but it came to nothing. We’d come
here on holidays because he liked
my family, but whenever I suggested
we do a year or something, he’d put
me off. It would be so weird if he
had turned to me and said “And what
do you want to do today?” I watched
that long documentary about George
Harrison and I thought “just own
it, own it like George Harrison’s
wife. Being a wife and mother is
enough.” And then I realized I
couldn’t remember her name.
So this pilot came along, and it
shot in LA and it paid so much and
it was like there was a little lifeline thrown to me “Here is a bit of
earth that’s yours.” And I was
embarrassed about it in front of
him, but also, it felt like “this
is who I am, this is what I’m worth
and it’s stupid, but at least it’s
mine.” And if he had taken me in a
big hug and said “Baby, I’m so
excited for your adventure and of
course I want you to have your own
piece of earth” then we might not
be getting divorced. But he made
fun of it. And was jealous, like he
is. BUT then he realized about the
money and told me I could funnel it
back into the theatre company. And
that’s when I realized that he
truly didn’t see me. He didn’t see
me as something separate from him.
And I asked him to say my phone
number. And he didn’t know it. So I
left.
NICOLE
I think Charlie also slept with
Mary Ann, the stage manager.
NORA
That fucking asshole.
JULES
You should buy everything.
HENRY
But I want to keep my money.
NICOLE
NICOLE
So, Cassie, you’re going to hand
him the envelope--
CASSIE
Why do I have to do it?
SANDRA
Because Nicole is very good at
getting people to do things for
her--
NICOLE
That’s not what this is--
SANDRA
I wiped her butt until she
was nine years old. She’s
very seductive that way.
NICOLE
No. Mom. Legally I can’t be the
one who serves him.
SANDRA
But still this is true what
I’m saying.
CASSIE
Do I have to actually hand
him the envelope?
NICOLE
Yes, but I’m going to tell him in
advance that they’re divorce
papers. Nora says it doesn’t have
to be so formal.
Where’s Henry?
CASSIE
He’s in the living room playing
with Jules and Molly.
NICOLE
Let’s get them upstairs. So, I’ll
tell Charlie what’s happening and
Cassie, you can then hand him the
envelope--
CASSIE
OK, I just get nervous--
SANDRA
Can you un-serve?
NICOLE
What do you mean, like take it
back?
SANDRA
Yeah.
NICOLE
I think so.
CASSIE
You should check.
SANDRA
In case we change our minds.
NICOLE
I’m not going to change my mind.
CASSIE
I know, but maybe just to
know in case I do something
wrong--
SANDRA
Or we all just feel too bad
for him.
NICOLE
Now you’re both just making ME
feel bad about it, OK.
CASSIE
Sorry... Sorry. I’m
nervous.
SANDRA
We all are. And we LOVE
Charlie.
NICOLE
You have to STOP loving him, Mom.
You can’t be his friend anymore.
SANDRA
Charlie and I have our own
relationship independent of your
marriage just like I’m friends
with Cassie’s ex, Jeff--
CASSIE
Are you still seeing Jeff?!
SANDRA
An occasional lunch.
CASSIE
I can’t believe you!
SANDRA
He still wants his camera
back by the way.
NICOLE
Listen, nothing can be independent
of our marriage right now. I
can’t believe I have to explain
this to you. Just be on MY side,
OK?
SANDRA
OK.
CASSIE
And stop seeing JEFF!
NICOLE
Cassie, you’re the server.
CASSIE
Just let me practice a few times.
I was never a good auditioner.
SANDRA
You wanted it too badly.
NICOLE
It’s not an audition.
SANDRA
I’ll play Charlie.
CASSIE
It’s just my palms are so
perspired.
SANDRA
Sweetie, you’re blotting the
envelope. Maybe Nicole should
play you.
CASSIE
Did you really just say that???
NICOLE
We don’t need to practice it.
It’s not a performance!
NICOLE
Did we finish the other one
already?
CASSIE
Oh, yeah.
NICOLE
OK, let me get it. You both go in
the other room. Cassie, make sure
Henry goes upstairs with Jules and
Molly.
CASSIE
Happening now.
Cassie and Sandra disperse. Nicole goes to the door.
Sandra reappears from another entrance.
NICOLE
Mom!
SANDRA
I’m getting my wine.
She grabs her glass and scurries away as Cassie reenters.
NICOLE
What?!
CASSIE
Henry’s pooping in the bathroom
downstairs.
NICOLE
Can we transfer him to the
upstairs one?
CASSIE
I think it’s mid-poop.
NICOLE
OK, grab him when he comes out.
Cassie!
CASSIE
What?!
NICOLE
I’m putting the envelope here by
the toaster.
CASSIE
Copy you.
CHARLIE
Hey-- Where’s Henry?
NICOLE
He’s pooping.
CHARLIE
Hi Henry!
CHARLIE
Does this couch still open?
CHARLIE
I got off the plane to a text--
But don’t tell anyone yet, it’s
still a secret.
NICOLE
OK--
CHARLIE
I won a MacArthur grant.
NICOLE
Oh, Charlie, that’s so great.
Congratulations!
CHARLIE
Thanks.
NICOLE
I’ll say it because you
can’t, it’s the genius
grant. You’re a genius.
CHARLIE
Well...
NICOLE
I’m really happy for you.
You deserve it--
CHARLIE
It’s yours too. We did all of
this together.
NICOLE
Well, thank you, but it’s yours,
Charlie, enjoy it.
CHARLIE
I’m starving--
CHARLIE
It’s good money, and they parse it
out over five years, but it means
I can keep everyone in the theater
company employed, pay my credit
card debt and--
NICOLE
It’s so great.
CHARLIE
Of course I went instantly to,
“it’s all down hill from here.”
Now my first Broadway play HAS to
fail--
NICOLE
No!
CHARLIE
We just started rehearsals
again...I don’t know...
NICOLE
You always don’t know at
this point and then it gets
there--
CHARLIE
Do I? Cause I don’t remember.
NICOLE
I know, but it’s true. It’ll be
great.
CHARLIE
OK. I hope you’re right.
Everyone says, Hi.
NICOLE
Tell them Hi. I miss everyone.
CHARLIE
Well, you’ll see them when
you come back--
NICOLE
A MacArthur, Broadway, it’s
so exciting.
Congratulations, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Which bathroom?
NICOLE
What?
CHARLIE
Is he pooping?
NICOLE
Oh...downstairs.
CHARLIE
Your mom home?
NICOLE
Yeah, she’s upstairs--
He knocks on the bathroom door.
CHARLIE
Hey, how’s it going?
HENRY
Nothing yet.
CHARLIE
It’s me.
HENRY
I know.
CHARLIE
I just got here.
HENRY
Hi.
CHARLIE
I brought you something.
HENRY
Yay. Mom is giving me a present
too.
CHARLIE
Why?
HENRY
For pooping.
CHARLIE
Oh...
I love you.
HENRY
I love you.
CHARLIE
I don’t think we should reward him
for pooping anymore.
NICOLE
I know, but he holds it in,
it’s getting on a week...
CHARLIE
It’s its own reward.
SANDRA
Hey there, Charlie-bird.
CHARLIE
G-ma!
SANDRA
Don’t, I’m so heavy!
CHARLIE
You’re light as a feather.
SANDRA
Oh, God, I’m so HUGE!
CHARLIE
You didn’t respond to my
last email!
SANDRA
Your emails are so articulate, I
get intimidated!
NICOLE
Mom, can you help with--
SANDRA
Now, I’m going to lift YOU!
NICOLE
MOM!
SANDRA
What?
NICOLE
Upstairs--
SANDRA
Oh...
I’m going to go write you back
now.
CASSIE
Hey, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Cassie, I like your haircut.
CASSIE
Oh, thanks.
HENRY
Mom!
SANDRA
Henry’s calling you, Nicole!
NICOLE
I hear him!
CHARLIE
What’s going on, Henry?!
HENRY
Can you have Mom come?
CHARLIE
He wants you--
NICOLE
Wait for me--
CHARLIE
What kind of pie is that?
CASSIE
It’s...
Pecan.
CHARLIE
Did you make it?
CASSIE
I don’t know. No! It’s store
bought. You know Joan’s on Third?
CHARLIE
Oh, yeah, that’s good, right?
CASSIE
What? The store? Yeah! Jules
and Molly love it.
CHARLIE
Are you OK?
CASSIE
Yes. I’m just HOT.
CHARLIE
I’ll pour you some water.
Nicole says you’re doing a play?
CASSIE
I think you’d like it! It’s a
great unproduced play by this
really interesting British writer.
CHARLIE
So you do an English accent?
CASSIE
Yeah, it’s more Northern England.
CHARLIE
Oh, what does that sound like?
CASSIE
Ya want a cup of tea, do ya?
CHARLIE
Oh, right. Good.
Oh, thank you, missus. What is--
CHARLIE
What’s this?
CASSIE
It’s a manilla envelope, love.
Can I start over?
CHARLIE
It has my name on it.
CASSIE
Oh Jesus, sorry. You’re served.
Sorry.
NICOLE
What did you do?
CASSIE
Nothing. I don’t know. I can’t
lie. You’re being served. You
guys are getting divorced. I
don’t know. I’m sorry.
NICOLE
I was going to warn you. So it
didn’t become a thing.
I’m sorry.
CHARLIE
I feel like I’m in a dream.
NICOLE
We don’t have a marriage anymore.
Charlie looks up at her.
NICOLE
I know you don’t want the
disruption, but you don’t want to
be married. Not really.
CHARLIE
But I don’t want THIS.
NICOLE
Well, what did you expect was
going to happen?
CHARLIE
I don’t know... I guess I didn’t
think it through. But I thought
we agreed--
CHARLIE
We weren’t going to use
lawyers.
NICOLE
I want a... I don’t know,
I’m trying to say this as
undramatically as possible.
I want an ENTIRELY different
kind of life.
CHARLIE
Let’s wait until you finish this
pilot and come back to New York
and... Let’s figure it out there,
at home. Together.
NICOLE
Nora is known for being
really fair
CHARLIE
We don’t need to do this
with envelopes and...
This is Nora?
NICOLE
Yeah. She’s great. I feel like
we could be friends with her.
CHARLIE
Why do I feel like that won’t
happen...
NICOLE
It’s a formality and you
don’t have to respond right
away.
CHARLIE
Why...why did Cassie have a
pie?
NICOLE
The pie was hers. The pie wasn’t
part of it.
CHARLIE
Are you sure?
NICOLE
Yeah, I mean, what would the pie
have to do with anything?
CHARLIE
I don’t know, it somehow
makes it worse.
NICOLE
Sorry. The pie was just a
pie.
CHARLIE
So, what... What do I do?
NICOLE
You get a lawyer too.
NICOLE
I forgot it ended that way.
CHARLIE
Yeah. Wow. Stuart really overreacted, didn’t you think?
HENRY
He was upset about his boat.
Dad, you go away-- Mom, you stay--
NICOLE
But Daddy, just got here--
CHARLIE
It’s OK. I love you.
HENRY
But you can come back and wake me
up and read to me later, Daddy.
OK?
CHARLIE
OK.
HENRY
Will you come sleep in my bed
later?
NICOLE
Yes.
SANDRA
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.
CHARLIE
Thanks G-ma.
NICOLE
He’s in a Mommy phase right now.
CHARLIE
It’s OK.
NICOLE
Sorry, I think I drank too much
wine--
CHARLIE
I can imagine. Stressful
time.
NICOLE
And didn’t eat dinner--
NICOLE
Ha, yeah... I hope Henry didn’t
notice.
CHARLIE
I’m sure he didn’t.
NICOLE
Now that I’m a parent I realize my
parents were probably drunk all
the time with me.
CHARLIE
Yeah.
NICOLE
Sorry again.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
NICOLE
Where are you staying?
CHARLIE
Oh, um...I hadn’t...I guess
I’ll...
NICOLE
There’s a new hotel over on
Highland that’s supposedly not too
expensive and pretty nice.
CHARLIE 
Oh...OK...I’ll check it out.
NICOLE
Again, that’s great about the
MacArthur.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
NICOLE
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Yeah?
CHARLIE
Thanks.
JAY MAROTTA
Fuck.
CHARLIE
What?
JAY MAROTTA
She’s being represented by Nora.
CHARLIE
She’s supposedly very fair?
JAY MAROTTA
Here’s the fact Jack: I charge 950
dollars an hour, Ted is 400, so if
you have a stupid question, call
Ted.
JAY MAROTTA
To start we’ll need a twenty-five
thousand dollar retainer--
CHARLIE
Oh, that’s more than I can--
TED
And all your financials.
We’ll need to do a forensic
accounting.
JAY SILVERMAN
Which runs anywhere from ten
to twenty thousand dollars.
CHARLIE
But if we can all agree right
away, it shouldn’t get too bad,
right?
JAY MAROTTA
You were married here, in LA?
CHARLIE
Yes, because her mom and
sister are out here and I’m
not close with my family and
so we just did it here...
JAY SILVERMAN
And your son was born out
here?
CHARLIE
Yes, because again her family was
out here and I’m not--
JAY MAROTTA
So you got married here, your kid
was born here and she served you
here?
CHARLIE
Yeah. But we LIVED in New York.
Why? Is there a problem?
TED
We’re going to have to reshape the
narrative.
JAY MAROTTA
If you’re serious about having
your child in New York, this is
what I would suggest, you take the
kid, did you say his name is Fred--
CHARLIE
Henry.
JAY MAROTTA
--Henry? Why did I think
Fred.
TED
I have a kid named Fred.
JAY MAROTTA
--you take Henry to New York
with you right now. Then we
file an action in New York.
Make it a New York case--
TED
We need to make an argument that
you’re a New York based family.
CHARLIE
Well, we ARE.
JAY MAROTTA
Otherwise, you’ll probably
never see your kid outside
of LA again.
CHARLIE
Really? No.
JAY MAROTTA
It’s very difficult to convince
the courts to MOVE a kid. As soon
as you let your wife and child
leave New York, you made life very
difficult for yourself.
CHARLIE
Yeah, but as I said, we are a New
York family, that’s just a fact.
She’s here temporarily.
JAY MAROTTA
Then why do you think she served
you out here?
CHARLIE
I don’t...know. But, Henry wants
to go back to New York, he tells
me--
JAY MAROTTA
Don’t quote your kid. He’s just
telling you what you want to hear.
Trust me, he’s telling her the
opposite.
JAY MAROTTA
What’s Exit Goat?
CHARLIE
Exit Ghost. It’s the name of my
theater company.
JAY MAROTTA
You’re a director?
CHARLIE
Theater director, yeah.
JAY MAROTTA
Anything I’ve seen?
CHARLIE
I don’t know. What have you seen?
CHARLIE
Our production of Electra is moving to
Broadway which is exciting--
JAY MAROTTA
We have to make sure that money is
protected.
CHARLIE
I mean, it’s theater, so it’s not
a lot of money. I basically put
whatever money I make back in the
theater.
JAY MAROTTA
I wonder--
Do WE ask for support?
TED
Interesting--
CHARLIE
From Nicole? I’m not going
to do that--
JAY MAROTTA
Does your wife’s family have
money?
CHARLIE
Her mother has some from her TV
career and her father died--
JAY MAROTTA
We could say we don’t want
her mother to see the kid,
draw HER into the case.
TED
In that instance, her mother
could pay your legal fees
too.
55.
CHARLIE
No. I’m very close to her mom.
Nicole’s family has been my family-
-
JAY MAROTTA
That’s going to change and I
suggest you get used to that.
We should hire a private
investigator--
CHARLIE
Really? I mean...REALLY?
JAY MAROTTA
We need to look for ways we
can show she’s a bad mother.
CHARLIE
But she’s not.
JAY MAROTTA
Your wife do drugs or
anything? Coke?
CHARLIE
Not in any real way--
JAY MAROTTA
We’re not going to win if she’s a
perfect mom.
CHARLIE
She was addicted to Tums for a
while.
CHARLIE
It wasn’t nothing. She was up to
a tube a day.
JAY MAROTTA
Have you noticed anyone following
YOU?
CHARLIE
No!
JAY MAROTTA
Keep an eye out. California’s a
no-fault state so even if you’re
fucking around it wouldn’t matter,
but, it doesn’t look good--
You need to be prepared for the
fact that Nora’s going to portray
you as a neglectful, absent,
father.
CHARLIE
But I’m not--
JAY MAROTTA
You live in New York,
consumed with your work, she
and the kid are out here,
struggling. Nora will use
that strategy, I’m sure of
it.
CHARLIE
She’s not going to LIE.
JAY MAROTTA
Listen, if we start from a place
of reasonable and they start from
a place of crazy when we settle,
we’ll be somewhere between
reasonable and crazy.
TED
Which is STILL crazy.
JAY MAROTTA
Half of crazy is crazy.
CHARLIE
Uh huh.
TED
You know what people say, criminal
lawyers see bad people at their
best, divorce lawyers see good
people at their worst.
JAY MAROTTA
You’ll end up hating me and Ted
before it’s all over just because
of what we represent in your life.
CHARLIE
I’m sure you’re right.
Maybe I didn’t explain this
well. We’re friendly, we’re
fine, we’re just trying to
figure this out--
JAY SILVERMAN
So, tell me the story again,
you came out to see your kid
and she served you? What a
bitch.
CHARLIE
She’s not a bitch...thanks, but
this isn’t...we’re doing it a
different way. And I can’t even
close afford this... I’ve got to
get back to New York. I have a
Broadway play in rehearsals--
FRANK
She was Rosalind and I was
Jaques. Nobody knew her
then --
BETH
Do you think it’s OK that
I’m doing the laughing fit
that way. Nicole did it
more like --I’m doing it--
And I don’t want to imitate
her--
ACTOR 3
You’re making it your own.
FRANK
Complete unknown. And I was
the hot shit you know, young
and very sexy with this
great head of hair.
BETH
I just so appreciate that
Charlie gave me this
opportunity. Or maybe I
should thank Nicole.
TERRY
I heard Nicole’s pilot went to
series so she’s staying in LA.
FEMALE
And they put Henry in school out
there.
MALE
Is Charlie moving there too?
BETH
Not Charlie.
MALE
He won’t abandon us.
TERRY
And you can’t do theater in LA.
They all laugh.
FEMALE ACTOR
Charlie said she and Henry are
coming back to New York once she
finishes filming her show.
MALE ACTOR
I wouldn’t be so sure.
MALE ACTOR
She was never going to stay
in New York. That was
obvious.
MALE ACTOR
She was probably planning
this move all along.
MALE ACTOR
When she sees an
opportunity, believe me, she
takes it.
MALE ACTOR
Well, LA is nice. The
space.
FRANK
And you know it’s “The Park” and
all that, and Joey Papp was
directing, and she just glided on
stage... we were cats in heat.
MALE ACTOR
Charlie HATES LA.
All of their attention eventually drifts toward Frank for
the big finish.
FRANK
Miss future four time Oscar winner
sucking my...
CHARLIE
Nobody come too close, I think I
got Donna’s cold.
DONNA
Sorry Charlie.
CHARLIE
Just a heads up, I’m waiting for a
Skype call from Henry so I might
have to step out--
FRANK
What you’re going through now is
going to be horrible. BUT it will
be over.
CHARLIE
Thanks, Frank.
FRANK
Another thing.
CHARLIE
Yes?
FRANK
Fuck as many people as you can
right now. Women, men...
FEMLE ACTOR
You might need help wrapping
some of the gauze, it needs
to stay tight.
FRANK
Take what I said seriously.
MALE ACTOR
I’m confused. What scene is the
Invisible Man outfit for?
CHARLIE
No, that’s my Halloween costume.
And the Frankenstein is for Henry.
CHARLIE
He’s coming here this
weekend and we’re going to
trick or treat in the Slope
and whatever--
FEMALE ACTOR
I made it more James Whale
than Kenneth Branagh.
CHARLIE
Perfect.
MARY ANN
Can I talk to you?
CHARLIE
Yeah, over--
MARY ANN
I typed up the notes from the last
two rehearsals and here’s the
blueprints--
CHARLIE
Where’d you find it?
MARY ANN
--from the original layout
of the Broadway theater--
MARY ANN
The library. Duh.
CHARLIE
Ha!
MARY ANN
Can I come over tonight?
CHARLIE
Mary Ann, it’s too hard now...I
just can’t be with anyone right
now.
MARY ANN
We did it when you were married,
when we shouldn’t have done it.
Now, that you’re not married, um,
shouldn’t we be doing it?
CHARLIE
I’m not not married...yet.
MARY ANN
You’re torturing yourself.
His phone is ringing.
CHARLIE
Just make sure everything doesn’t
go to hell here. I’m relying on
you, OK?
MARY ANN
Fine.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
CHARLIE
Hold on, let me--
MARY ANN
I wish you’d accept
generosity better.
CHARLIE
Hello?
NORA
Is this Charlie Barber?
CHARLIE
Yes.
NORA
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw, I
represent your wife, Nicole
Barber.
CHARLIE
Hi.
NORA
Do you have an attorney yet?
CHARLIE
No.
NORA
OK, then it’s OK for me to talk to
you directly. OK?
CHARLIE
OK.
NORA
I’m calling because we haven’t
received a response to our filing.
CHARLIE
Yeah, I’ve been rehearsing this
play and flying back and forth to
LA--
NORA
You’re going to need to file your
response.
CHARLIE
Nicole said there was no rush.
NORA
It’s been more than thirty days
since you were served. By law
you’re meant to respond within
thirty days.
CHARLIE
I didn’t like the first
lawyer I met.
NORA
It says that very clearly on
the document you were given.
Did you read it?
CHARLIE
But I thought that’s just what it
says...we weren’t going to even do
it with lawyers--
FRANK
Charlie, I’m thinking I shouldn’t
tuck in the shirt?
CHARLIE
Nicole said I could take my
time--
FRANK
--it keeps coming out during
the love scene--
NORA
And we’ve let you take your
time...
CHARLIE
What love scene?
FRANK
When I hug Beth.
CHARLIE
You don’t hug Beth.
FRANK
It’s something I’m trying.
NORA
If you don’t file your
response we’re going to file
a request for default
judgement against you.
CHARLIE
You can’t just tuck it in
tighter or get Donna to
safety pin it?
FRANK
I also have a thing about tucking
in things--
FRANK
It’s a hold-over from
childhood. Insecurities
about my figure.
NORA
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Yes, sorry--
CHARLIE
A default judgement. What does
that mean?
NORA
We’ll be able to lay claim to
whatever we want.
CHARLIE
What do you mean? Whatever you
want of what?
NORA
Your apartment, your things--well,
everything you own.
CHARLIE
She and I already discussed this,
we don’t own that much stuff, she
can have pretty much whatever she--
NORA
And it means, we’ll set the number
for child support at its highest
level and claim full custody of
your child...
CHARLIE
Full custody? I mean, that’s not
even--
NORA
This is what the law says.
CHARLIE
Nicole’s not going to do that. I
mean...she won’t.
NORA
No, Charlie, I represent Nicole
and she’s aware of everything I’m
saying to you.
CHARLIE
I just spoke to her this morning.
NORA
Well, I spoke to her five minutes
before I got on this call.
Silence.
CHARLIE
Um, OK, what do I do?
NORA
You need to get a lawyer and
respond immediately. Nicole wants
to do this amicably but you’re
leaving us no other option,
Charlie.
CHARLIE
I’ll get a lawyer. Can I get a
lawyer here?
NORA
I don’t know where “here” is.
CHARLIE
New York.
NORA
That’s what all that honking is!
No, you’ll have to come to LA and
meet people in LA.
CHARLIE
I’m rehearsing a--
NORA
If you don’t respond in Los
Angeles by Friday, you’ll
leave us no choice.
CHARLIE
Ugh, I can’t see..
And I’m still driving.
HENRY
Me and Mommy are in the middle of
a Super Secret Treasure Hunt--
CHARLIE
What are you wearing?
NICOLE
I thought the plane landed at ten.
CHARLIE
It did.
HENRY
Sock pants!
CHARLIE
What are sock pants?
NICOLE
He doesn’t like the breeze on his
legs--
CHARLIE
There are long pants--
NICOLE
He dressed himself.
CHARLIE
Can I talk to you--
HENRY
Why don’t we ever do a
treasure hunt?
NICOLE
It’s almost noon.
CHARLIE
We got to get going--
HENRY
I’m not done searching for my
money!
CHARLIE
Can I talk to you for a
minute? Henry, can you wait
a minute--
HENRY
No talking alone.
CHARLIE
Just one bit of talking alone and
then I’ll be right there--
CHARLIE
I got a call from your lawyer.
She said you’d take everything and
custody and everything if I didn’t
respond.
NICOLE
That’s how lawyers talk--
CHARLIE
Yeah, but she’s saying
things I don’t think you
mean--
NICOLE
It’s better if we just let the
lawyers do this--
CHARLIE
We said we’d figure this out
together.
Henry starts running back to the house.
CHARLIE
Henry, we need to get going--
NICOLE
Have you gotten a lawyer
yet?
HENRY
I don’t want to go now.
CHARLIE
That’s what I’m here to do.
Charlie opens the car door.
CHARLIE
Come on, Henry, I’m in a rush--
And I looked Nora up. She’s
fancy. We...you can’t afford her.
NICOLE
She said she’d make it work--
CHARLIE
Henry!
HENRY
I have three more clues!
CHARLIE
Why did you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my
arrival?
NICOLE
You were late, we were killing
time.
HENRY
I’m going to be rich!
NICOLE
We can finish the treasure hunt
later. Go with Daddy now, it’ll
be FUN.
I’ll have a present for you when
you get back as a reward--
CHARLIE
He’s not going to the dentist.
NICOLE
I’m trying to help--
HENRY
I’m staying here.
Henry grabs hold of his Mom.
NICOLE
OK--
CHARLIE
Come on--
CHARLIE
Henry--
NICOLE
You have a booster?
CHARLIE
I have a booster.
NICOLE
It’s not in.
CHARLIE
What’s not in?
NICOLE
The seat. It’s not
connected.
CHARLIE
I asked the rental company to
install it.
NICOLE
I think they can’t for liability
reasons--
CHARLIE
Do you know how these things
NICOLE
Let me do it--
NICOLE
No, you have to--
CHARLIE
There should be a clip
thing, a thing to clip on
to.
NICOLE
Here, you have dig--
CHARLIE
Ow, fuck.
HENRY
Why “fuck?”
NICOLE
You OK?
CHARLIE
Something’s sharp--
HENRY
Can’t I stay with Mom?
CHARLIE
No--
HENRY
Why not?
CHARLIE
It’s my time with you. I
just flew three thousand
miles.
HENRY
I don’t want to--
CHARLIE
Henry, get in the fucking car!
CHARLIE
I’m sorry, but Jesus, get in the
fucking car.
HENRY
How do you spell Lego Bionicles?
CHARLIE
That’s two words. What does Lego
start with?
HENRY
Just tell me.
CHARLIE
Don’t you want to learn it?
HENRY
No, it’s on the box anyway.
CHARLIE
L.
HENRY
Then what?
CHARLIE
E. You know, everyone at the
theater says Hi.
HENRY
Hi. Then what?
CHARLIE
A “ggg” sound. Are you excited
for Halloween?
HENRY
J?
CHARLIE
G.
HENRY
Then what?
CHARLIE
An “O” sound.
HENRY
O.
CHARLIE
Are you excited for
Halloween?
HENRY
Yeah.
CHARLIE
I brought both our costumes.
HENRY
I’m going to go as a store-bought
ninja.
CHARLIE
But we agreed, I had Donna make
you a Frankenstein.
HENRY
I don’t want to be a Frankenstein
anymore.
CHARLIE
Are you sure, maybe just look at
it? It’s awesome. We’ll be
Frankenstein and the Invisible
Man!
HENRY
Mom bought me a ninja costume
which is better because it costs
more.
CHARLIE
Technically, the
Frankenstein costs more when
you factor in Donna’s time
and the materials--
HENRY
The cousins are also going
to be ninjas.
CHARLIE
But Henry, we went through all
this trouble--
OK, whatever you want...
CHARLIE
...and so I’m not
comfortable leaving the bags
in a car where I’ve given
the key to someone I don’t
know--
HENRY
I’ve been here.
CHARLIE
It’s an office building so you’ve
been to places like this before.
HENRY
I remember those fish.
CHARLIE
A lot of fish look the same.
The receptionist looks up.
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you--
CHARLIE
I’m Charlie Barber, I have a
one thirty with Dan Cohen.
RECEPTIONIST
Oh, hi. Where’s your little
man?
HENRY
I don’t have it this time. I keep
my skeletons at my mom’s.
RECEPTIONIST
OK... Oh, OK... I’m sorry, we
tried to reach you, Mr. Cohen
wanted me to apologize. He can’t
see you because apparently your
wife already met with him on the
7th of August about
representation...
CHARLIE
But she hired somebody else, uh,
Nora...
RECEPTIONIST
Fanshaw? But unfortunately
because she consulted with Mr.
Cohen already, he’s legally barred
from representing you.
CHARLIE
Oh... Really?
RECEPTIONIST
Should we feed the fish?
RECEPTIONIST
It happens all the time. If you
have a ticket I can validate your
parking.
RECEPTIONIST
It’s common that people meet with
as many lawyers as possible so
that their spouse has limited
options.
CHARLIE
I don’t think she would have done
it deliberately.
RECEPTIONIST
You’d be surprised.
CHARLIE
Did you go to a lot of offices
with your mom?
HENRY
Not so many. Like eleven.
HENRY
I don’t think anyone would have
stealed the bags, Daddy.
CHARLIE
I need somebody TODAY. If I don’t
respond by tomorrow, she said I
could lose custody? I didn’t know
who else to call... There’s got
to be someone she didn’t meet.
FEMALE
She’d kill me if she knew we were
talking.
CHARLIE
I know. I really appreciate
it.
FEMALE
It’s high alert over here.
SANDRA
OK, I have a name for you. Bert
Spitz. He was the entertainment
lawyer at Roberto’s agency, and
for years, he negotiated all of
Robbie’s Dynasty and Falcon Crest
deals. He kind of got pushed into
retirement a few years ago and he
went into family law.
HENRY
“They’re out for bl-ode.”
CHARLIE
It’s a double “O”. What
sound is that?
HENRY
Blo-oode?
CHARLIE
Blood. You’re getting good at
reading.
HENRY
“They’re out for blood.”
SANDRA
I called him and he can see you
today at 4.
CHARLIE
Great!
SANDRA
And he should be more affordable.
HENRY
Oh, shit.
CHARLIE
Thank you G-ma. Thank you.
HENRY
Dad!
SANDRA
We never had this conversation,
Charlie-bird.
CHARLIE
Got it! I love you.
NICOLE
Mom?!
SANDRA
I have to go--
HENRY
I need a new burger.
CHARLIE
Why?
HENRY
Because you made us carry your
bags into the restaurant, I
dropped it.
CHARLIE
It’s fine, get in the car.
HENRY
Why did you take me today if you
couldn’t hang out with me?
CHARLIE
Because I’ve been away and want to
see you.
BERT
Getting a divorce with a kid can
be one of the hardest things
you’ll ever do. It’s like a death
without a body.
BERT
I know, personally I’ve been there
four different times.
CHARLIE
You’ve been divorced four times?
BERT
I’ve been married four times.
Three divorces. This last one
will stick God willing.
That’s why I graduated into family
law. To help people survive this
painful time.
Here’s how I see it: If we get
bogged down in who did this and
that and “I don’t want to pay the
two dollars” it’ll just cost you
more money and time and emotional
stress, and you’ll probably end up
with the same result anyway.
CHARLIE
Right. I mean, I agree with
that philosophy. She does
too, I’m sure.
BERT
And I always go with the
truth wherever that takes
us. Most people in this
business make up the truth
to get to where they need to
go.
BERT
You’re just transactions to them.
I like to think of you as people.
CHARLIE
Oh. OK. Good.
BERT
And not just you, her too.
CHARLIE
Yes.
BERT
It can be an ugly process.
But I believe it also
doesn’t have to be terrible.
CHARLIE
I’m glad to hear you say that.
Um, I’d love to keep expenses down
as much as possible.
BERT
Of course you do. I charge 450 an
hour and I’ll need a ten thousand
dollar retainer to start.
CHARLIE
Maybe this is a stupid question,
but is there any way to do this on
a budget?
BERT
This is the budget version.
CHARLIE
I’ll see if I can get an advance
on the Broadway transfer...
BERT
And keep in mind, you’ll have to
pay for her lawyer.
CHARLIE
Oh... I didn’t... What?
BERT
Or at least part of her. It
doesn’t make sense, does it? The
reason you’re doing this is
because you love your kid and in
doing so you’re draining money
from your kid’s education.
CHARLIE
It seems ridiculous.
BERT
Oh, it is.
BERT
We’ll have to respond right away.
Your son is in school out here?
CHARLIE
Temporarily. We agreed. Her
pilot went to series and I wanted
to accommodate her as she’s often
felt we do things on my terms.
BERT
Be a better husband in divorce.
CHARLIE
I guess something like that. But
we live in New York.
BERT
With your kid in school here, the
court may see it otherwise.
CHARLIE
Will we go to court?
BERT
No no no, we don’t want to go to
court, the California courts are a
disaster -- it’s just how we have
to think about it.
I’m not sure these are my glasses.
Where are you living when you’re
out here?
CHARLIE
I’m in a hotel right now--
BERT
Hotel doesn’t look good.
CHARLIE
To who?
BERT
The court.
CHARLIE
You just said we weren’t going to
go to court.
BERT
Of course, of course. We prepare
to go to court hoping that we
don’t go to court.
CHARLIE
OK.
BERT
You should get a place in LA. And
get a place NEAR her. That will
look better for custody reasons.
CHARLIE
She’s in West Hollywood. That’ll
be expensive. I guess I could
rent our New York apartment.
BERT
Don’t rent it, you need to
continue to prove New York
residence--
CHARLIE
OK.
BERT
And of course getting a
place in LA, doesn’t make it
look like you all live in
New York, does it?
CHARLIE
So...
What do I do?
BERT
I recommend you try to spend as
much time with your child as
possible. Many people fight to
get the time and then they don’t
even use it. They just want to
win.
CHARLIE
This shouldn’t be that
complicated, right? I mean, we’re
a New York family. I think it’s
all pretty straight-forward.
Right?
BERT
I hope so, yes. I see no reason--
you both love your son, you
respect each other--why this
shouldn’t be relatively pain-free?
CHARLIE
Right.
BERT
I think you have my glasses--
She takes off hers and they swap. She nods.
NELL
That makes sense.
CHARLIE
What have you been doing?
NELL
We were talking about money.
HENRY
And I was reading this
magazine.
CHARLIE
You were reading California
Lawyer?
HENRY
Uh uh.
CHARLIE
OK, I’m almost done.
Henry pets the old cat.
BERT
I wouldn’t expect too much from
that cat.
BERT
I want you to know that eventually
this will all be over and whatever
we win or lose, it’ll be the two
of you having to figure this out
together.
CHARLIE
Thank you. You’re the first
person in this process who has
spoken to me like a human.
BERT
You remind me of myself, on my
second marriage.
HENRY
Mommy!
NICOLE
Did you have fun with Daddy?
HENRY
We drove around to offices.
NICOLE
Do you want to try on your ninja
costume? It’s on your bed!
HENRY
Yeah!
Henry runs upstairs.
CHARLIE
You know I had Donna build him
this whole Frankenstein thing with
the plugs and --
NICOLE
The cousins are ninjas so he
wanted to do that too.
CHARLIE
But he and I had decided
together--
NICOLE
I can’t make him be Frankenstein.
CHARLIE
I’m not asking you to. But maybe
you could help me out a little.
I’ll leave the Frankenstein here
and maybe you can nudge him in
that direction--
NICOLE
I’ll try.
CHARLIE
What’s the...did you dye your hair
again? Is that for your show?
NICOLE
No, this is me. It was this way
when I saw you before.
CHARLIE
I know, but I didn’t say anything
then.
NICOLE
You don’t like it?
CHARLIE
No, I guess...it’s fine. Is
it shorter? I prefer it
long, but...
NICOLE
I’m sorry, it’s just -- absurd.
CHARLIE
Is everything OK?
NICOLE
Yeah, why?
CHARLIE
You seem...I don’t know like
something is--
NICOLE
Everything’s fine.
CHARLIE
OK.
OK, I’m going to check in at the
hotel, but should be able to get
to you guys by five, five thirty.
We’ll go trick or treating from
there--
NICOLE
Um, we’re going to go to Cassie’s
in Pasadena.
CHARLIE
Cassie lives in Pasadena
now?
NICOLE
And trick-or-treating with
the cousins. Yeah, she and Sam moved a couple
of months ago.
CHARLIE
OK. I don’t really know Pasadena.
I’ll figure it out. What’s the
address? I’ll text Sam.
NICOLE
And because my mom is
looking forward to this and
Cassie and Sam are--
CHARLIE
Wait until you see MY
costume.
NICOLE
Are mad--
CHARLIE
Mad at who?
NICOLE
You.
CHARLIE
Cassie and Sam?
NICOLE
You can understand that.
NICOLE
--so I think we should probably do
separate Halloweens--
CHARLIE
But if you’re OK with it, then
shouldn’t they be OK with it--
NICOLE
Let’s just do it this way
this time. OK?
CHARLIE
Do you not want me there?
NICOLE
No, I’m fine with it.
CHARLIE
OK.
NICOLE
It’ll be nice for him, he’ll
get two Halloweens.
CHARLIE
What am I going to do with him for
second Halloween? Walk around
Sunset Boulevard?
NICOLE
Maybe the hotel has something? Or
you can drive to another
neighborhood?
CHARLIE
OK! Ready for Halloween!
NICOLE
Wow. Elaborate.
Charlie adjusts his goggles.
NICOLE
Sweetheart, don’t forget your
jacket. It’s getting colder.
CHARLIE
You ready to go back out?
NICOLE
He has to pee.
HENRY
No, I don’t.
NICOLE
He does.
NICOLE
Some of his men and Bear Bear are
in there-- You can keep this Bear
Bear because I got another one--
CHARLIE
Does he know that there are two
Bear Bears?
NICOLE
Yes, it was his idea--
HENRY
I have LA Bear Bear and New
York Bear Bear--
CHARLIE
Station to Station?
NICOLE
Let’s Dance.
OK, bye Henry. Have a great
Halloween with Daddy. Have fun.
Charlie nods coldly and closes the door.
HENRY
This is a nice house.
Henry turns his plastic jack o’ lantern over and dumps all
his candy on the floor. He lies down and starts sorting
it.
86.
CHARLIE
Go pee and then we’re going back
out!
HENRY
I’m too tired!
CHARLIE
GO pee and then we’re going to go
drive to Halloween!
CHARLIE
This block looks promising--
HENRY
I wish Halloween was over.
CHARLIE
Well, it isn’t.
If we were in New York we could be
walking.
HENRY
But I like that we’re sitting
right now. I like to sit.
CHARLIE
That’s true, Los Angeles does have
sitting going for it.
HENRY
I think that’s why I like Los
Angeles better.
CHARLIE
Because you get to sit?
HENRY
And because I like my
friends here better.
CHARLIE
That’s not true. What about
Horatio and Poppy and--
HENRY
Horatio doesn’t like me anymore
and I don’t like Poppy. Here I
have Axel. Axel is hilarious.
And my family is here. Besides
you.
HENRY
Everyone’s asleep.
CHARLIE
Say it.
HENRY
I don’t want to.
CHARLIE
Trick or treat.
The seventeen year old clerk looks around and hands them
some junk.
CHARLIE
Who gave you a lighter?
HENRY
I have to pee.
CHARLIE
I’m going to have to go back to
New York on Monday.
CHARLIE
Did you flush?
CHARLIE
Wash your hands.
CHARLIE
Did you hear me? I have to go
back to New York.
HENRY
Aaah, watch out... BSSSHH! “I’m
falling.” “I’ll catch you.”
BOOOM. “You didn’t catch me.”
CHARLIE
OK?
HENRY
Why aren’t you here more?
CHARLIE
I have to work. You know my play
is opening on Broadway.
HENRY
Is it because you don’t want to be
near mom?
CHARLIE
No-- You know, like we’ve talked
about, we’ve decided not to be
together no matter where we are.
But we both want to be with you.
HENRY
But you’re not near me if you’re
in New York.
CHARLIE
Well, we all still live in New
York.
HENRY
Yeah. But I go to school here.
CHARLIE
Just for right now. Like that
time we were in Copenhagen for my
play. Remember all those kids in
buckets?
HENRY
I like my school here and Mom says
we can stay here if we want.
Charlie freezes.
CHARLIE
What do you mean...She said that?
HENRY
Yeah.
NICOLE
Hello?
CHARLIE
Are you moving out here?
NICOLE
Did you find a lawyer?
CHARLIE
Yes. Henry says you’re moving
here???
NICOLE
Have your lawyer call Nora.
CHARLIE
I want to talk about it as us.
NICOLE
Who the fuck is “us?”
CHARLIE
Let’s just get in a room, YOU and
ME, that’s what we always said
we’d do.
NICOLE
My lawyers wouldn’t let me
sign anything.
CHARLIE
It’s not up to them. It’s
up to us. It’s OUR divorce.
NICOLE
They say I could later sue them
for malpractice.
CHARLIE
What am I walking into?
NICOLE
What are you walking into?!
CHARLIE
Yes! What the fuck is going on?
NICOLE
I read your fucking emails,
CHARLIE. I read them all.
CHARLIE
When?
NICOLE
I don’t know. Recently!
NICOLE
You are a FUCKING LIAR. You
fucked Mary Ann.
CHARLIE
... Shit.
CHARLIE
It was after I was sleeping on the
couch.
NICOLE
And all this bullshit about
working on us or whatever, you
know what-- I HAVE been working,
I’ve BEEN DOING THE WORK. ALONE.
CHARLIE
How did you read my emails?
NICOLE
I HACKED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT
YOU DUMB FUCK.
CHARLIE
I think that’s illegal.
NICOLE
About a week ago. So don’t
give me this shit about
being surprised about LA.
Surprise! I have opinions.
Surprise! I want things that
aren’t what you want because
SURPRISE YOU WERE FUCKING
ANOTHER LADY.
CHARLIE
How do you even know how to
do something like that? I think you’re conflating two
different things. Mary Ann has
nothing to do with LA.
NICOLE
I’m conflating, motherfucker.
Watch me conflate!
She hangs up and visibly stamps her foot.
PABLO
Did you just stamp your foot?
NICOLE
I don’t think I’ve ever done that
before. I’m sorry I’m just so
ANGRY.
PABLO
You look like you needed one.
NICOLE
I do. Thanks.
PABLO
You know the Japanese are making
really interesting tequila right
now.
NICOLE
That’s exciting, I guess.
PABLO
What are you so angry about?
NICOLE
Ugh, my fucking ex-husband. I
spend so much time feeling guilty,
but he’s so self-absorbed it’s
pointless. It’s a game I’m
playing with myself.
PABLO
Oh, hey, Pablo. We met at
the--
NICOLE
You held the bounce board!
PABLO
The flirty grip!
NICOLE
Here’s what I want you to only do,
OK?
PABLO
What?
NICOLE
I want you to finger me.
PABLO
What?
NICOLE
Just finger me.
PABLO
OK.
NICOLE
That’s all we’re going to do, OK?
Just fingering. I’m changing my
whole fucking life.
NORA
Nicole and Charlie’s son, Henry,
was born here in Los Angeles and
currently attends Laurel
Elementary in Laurel Canyon--
NORA
--and Nicole works in Hollywood on
her show while also maintaining a
full schedule as a mother with
classes of swim, art, gym and
music as well as play groups.
Nicole is Henry's primary
custodial parent and to the extent
that Charlie would like to
exercise his custodial time, he
should be making efforts to visit
Henry here in California.
BERT
Nora, you seem to be ignoring the
fact that they lived in New York
for ten years--
NORA
My client worked in New York, for
several years--that’s true. But
Nicole was born and bred right
here in LA. She and Charlie would
come here most holidays and
summers to spend time with her
family who all live here. She and
Charlie were married here, would
you like to see the photos?
BERT
I don’t need to see the photos--
Although I’m sure they both look
beautiful--
BERT
It’s my client’s expectation that
after this TV show is completed,
the parties will move back to New
York where they currently keep an
apartment--
NORA
And it’s my understanding that
Charlie PROMISED Nicole that they
would spend more time in LA during
the marriage but because of
Charlie’s insistence that his work
keep them in New York, Nicole
ended up staying much longer than
she ever anticipated. In fact, a
few years ago, Charlie was offered
a residency at the Geffen
Playhouse that would have taken
his work and family to LA for a
year and he turned it down knowing
full well that this was Nicole’s
desire.
BERT
He wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child.
NORA
Was this the same consistency he
wanted to maintain when they went
to Copenhagen for six months so he
could direct a play?
NORA
So, while I understand that
CHARLIE lives in New York and when
it’s convenient for his work
schedule, flies out here to see
his son--
BERT
He flies out here every
chance he gets at great
expense--
NORA
I don’t see any reason you
can’t be out here full-time.
AMIR
Oh... Sorry. Do we want to
contemplate lunch--I’ll order now
so it’ll come when we’re all
hungry?
BERT
Good idea.
AMIR
Everyone good with Manny’s?
BERT
I love Manny’s.
NORA
Have you had Manny’s?
NORA
You’ll love it, just really yummy
salads and sandwiches.
CHARLIE
Great.
CHARLIE
Hmm, I don’t know-- Sorry...
NICOLE
Charlie will have the greek salad.
CHARLIE
OK.
NICOLE
But with olive oil and lemon
instead of the greek
dressing, and I’ll get the
Chinese chicken salad.
NORA
Congratulations, Charlie, on your
grant, Nicole told me.
CHARLIE
Thank you.
BERT
He’s a genius.
CHARLIE
Oh, thanks.
NORA
I told Nicole, I LOVED your play.
You are one smart cookie. I’d
love to get inside your brain!
CHARLIE
Thanks.
NORA
There was that one moment when you
smell the toast. Smell! It was literally my
favorite thing I saw that year.
Truly genius.
BERT
I was sorry to hear it closed on
Broadway.
CHARLIE
They couldn’t smell the toast.
BERT
It’s very competitive, I imagine.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
NORA
Now, whenever Charlie is in LA,
Nicole, of course, agrees that it
will best for Henry to see each
parent equally-- It’s nice out here, Charlie. You
should give it a chance.
AMIR
Yeah, and the space -- you can’t
beat it.
BERT
I love it too, but all of our
personal feelings about the two
cities aside, we don’t share your
assertion that the couple is an LA
based family. It was very clearly
their deal that they would go back
to New York after Nicole finished
her show.
NORA
I’m not aware of any deal.
CHARLIE
I didn’t get it in writing.
NORA
Charlie, is this like the deal you
made that you and Nicole would
spend more time in LA during the
marriage?
CHARLIE
We didn’t have a deal. It was
something we discussed...but...
NORA
So, it’s a deal when it’s
something you want, but it’s a
discussion when Nicole wants it?
BERT
Sidebar!
Nora, is there a spare office,
where Charlie and I could sidebar?
BERT
Nora’s a very good lawyer.
CHARLIE
Uh huh.
BERT
Tough, right?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
BERT
And you’re in a bind because
you’ve shown that you’re willing
to fly out here and rent an
apartment to see your son--
CHARLIE
You told me to do that!
BERT
I know that.
CHARLIE
And I’m doing that because I
want to see my kid. Not to
set a precedent.
BERT
Yes, but unfortunately you are
setting a precedent. And a judge
may look at it that way.
CHARLIE
What’s the alternative? I stay in
New York and never come out here?
BERT
No, because then it will look to
the court like you don’t care
about seeing your son.
CHARLIE
Court or no court, stop saying
court and then never court!
BERT
Well, the way this is going, we
might have to go to court.
CHARLIE
Are you aware how maddening you
sound?
BERT
I am. And I know it seems unfair.
But imagine if you were a poor
mother abandoned by her husband
who refuses to pay anything.
That’s what the system is trying
to protect people from.
Charlie nods.
BERT
Listen, if I were representing you--
CHARLIE
You are representing me.
BERT
Right, no, of course. I don’t see
a judge moving this child from LA--
I think we try to settle today--
CHARLIE
Settle meaning... what?
BERT
She gets LA, but--
CHARLIE
No, Bert... just NO. I mean, we
have to win this?
BERT
Remember, the win is what’s best
for Henry. And if you guys go to
court, he’ll get pulled into it.
CHARLIE
If he stays out here and I stay in
New York, that’s just, then I
won’t, I’ll never get to really be
his parent again.
BERT
It’ll be different.
CHARLIE
It won’t exist!
BERT
Maybe you move here. You heard
what Amir said about the space.
CHARLIE
Fuck the space, Bert. FUCK THE
SPACE.
BERT
I’ll do whatever you want me to
do, but this is my advice. I’ve
seen these things go on and on and
the burden of these battles is
immeasurable. I had a client get
colon cancer and die before he and
his wife came to agreement.
CHARLIE
What about filing in New York?
BERT
It’s too late and even if you did,
I don’t think it would matter.
They’re being reasonable
financially. You’re lucky they’re
not asking for half of your grant
money--
CHARLIE
She wouldn’t do that. She knows,
I put all that money back in my
theater.
BERT
If this continues, she might.
CHARLIE
The actors and crew all rely on
that money, they have families and-
- A court would never agree with
this, right?
BERT
Whether they do or not, it’ll cost
you half your grant money anyway
to go to court and prove it.
Charlie deflates.
CHARLIE
I feel like a criminal.
BERT
But you didn’t commit any crime.
CHARLIE
It doesn’t feel that way.
BERT
If we give on LA right now and try
to make the best deal possible, I
think we can get her to give on
some other fronts.
CHARLIE
There are no other fronts. This
is the thing. He needs to know that I fought for
him.
BERT
He’ll know.
CHARLIE
I should never have let her
come out here with Henry.
BERT
If it wasn’t LA and New York it
would be something else. You’d be
fighting over a house or school
district or... It’s like the joke
about the woman at the hairdresser
who’s going to Rome--
CHARLIE
I don’t--
BERT
A woman is at her
hairdresser’s and she says,
“Oh, I’m going to Rome on
holiday” and the hairdresser
says--
Charlie stares at the clock on the wall.
BERT
“What airline are you taking?”
And she says, “Al Italia.” And he
says, “Oh that’s the worst airline
I’ve--”
CHARLIE
I’m sorry, Bert, but am I paying
for this joke?
BERT
No matter what happens here, it’s
temporary. He’s growing up, he’s
going to have opinions on the
subject. Time is on your side,
Charlie. Maybe he’ll do college
on the East Coast.
HENRY
I have my quarters and dimes at
Daddy’s, but I’m keeping my
dollars and my one twenty with
you, OK?
NICOLE
Goddamn it.
HENRY
What’s goddamn it?
NICOLE
Did you lose power where you are?
HENRY
Dad, did we lose power?!
CHARLIE
No.
NICOLE
It’s back on now. There are
rolling blackouts in the hills but
now the gate won’t close.
HENRY
Her gate won’t close!
CHARLIE
You tried all the--
NICOLE
I tried everything.
HENRY
Can I look at my room?
NICOLE
Of course.
Henry runs inside. They remain outside.
NICOLE
I’m sorry I made you come
out--
CHARLIE
It’s fine--
NICOLE
It’s just--
CHARLIE
You don’t want your gate
open.
NICOLE
Right.
CHARLIE
There should be a panel or
something either inside or--
She stands in the threshold, blocking his path. She points
toward a white box amongst trees in the yard.
NICOLE
I think this is something--
He steps over some bushes and inspects the alarm system.
CHARLIE
It’s a cute house.
NICOLE
Thanks.
CHARLIE
I mean, from what I can see.
NICOLE
You’re getting shaggy.
CHARLIE
Yeah, I have to find a haircutter.
NICOLE
Do you want me to cut it?
CHARLIE
OK.
NICOLE
I’ll get scissors.
NICOLE
Close your eyes. He’s out. Maybe he should stay
here tonight--
CHARLIE
It’s my night.
NORA
I think we’re mostly finished.
Bert and I hammered out ninetypercent of the details, there’s a
couple minor things hanging that
should be easy and then the judge
will make your divorce official.
NICOLE
OK, good--
NORA
I hear the tracking for your show
is off the chain--
NICOLE
Oh, I don’t even know what that
means, but good I guess--
NORA
I made sure the date of separation
came AFTER the pilot pick-up to
protect that money--
Fuck me.
NICOLE
What?
JAY MAROTTA
It’s not television. It’s not a
wise judge played by a great
character actor. These are just
people open to manipulation like
anyone else. You think it’s
justice, but it’s not.
NICOLE
Who is that?
NORA
Charlie shouldn’t have done this.
NICOLE
What do you mean? Where’s Bert?
NORA
It means everything we’ve agreed
upon is now off the table.
NICOLE
But, we’ve got LA, right--
NORA
Not with Jay Marotta representing
him. This is a street fight now.
And I’m going to have to ask for
things we wouldn’t normally ask
for. We’ll need as much leverage
as possible to negotiate with.
NORA
This system rewards bad behavior.
JAY MAROTTA
A little history.
Jay speaks in front of the judge who clearly has a bad
cold. Charlie sits at the end of the table with Ted, the
associate. Nicole is at the corresponding end of an
adjacent table next to Nora and Amir.
JAY MAROTTA
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a
risk when he first hires Nicole as
an actress in his play in New York
City. He’s a well regarded, up and
coming director of the avant garde
and she’s known as the girl in
that college sex movie who takes
her top off.
NORA
My client will not be slutshamed for an artistic
choice.
JAY MAROTTA
Ten years on and many
prestigious theater roles
later, she’s become an
actress of great
credibility. And because of
this credibility, she’s
offered a lead roll on a
major television show. This
new opportunity in her life
is thanks to Charlie. Your
honor, I don’t see why we
should be paying any support
money at this point. In
fact, Charlie should be
entitled to half of her TV
salary, present and future
earnings on the show.
Nora takes a moment.
NORA
Charlie has just received
the enormous sum of six
hundred and fifty thousand
dollars in the form of a
MacArthur grant for the
theater work he has
conducted during the
marriage.
JAY MAROTTA
Of which he gets in 125
thousand installments over
five years, money that is
used to employ actors and
crew members and to pay back
debts he’s accumulated with
his theater company that
stars his wife.
NORA
By Jay’s same logic, this is work
that Nicole contributed to in
numerous ways. Not only did she
give up a lucrative and successful
career in movies to perform in his
little theater, she also supplied
Charlie with a loan early on to
help out.
JAY
Which he paid back--
NORA
She lent her name to the
marquee and was the
principle reason people came
to the theater.
JAY
That may have been true ten
years ago--
NORA
She, in turn, helped
establish Charlie’s
reputation.
NORA
Over the next ten years she was
subsequently offered parts in
movies, TV shows, most of which
she turned down at Charlie’s
bequest to be a mother and to act
in his plays. Now, while we’re
willing to be flexible on support
we contend that half of Charlie’s
grant money should be split
between the parties.
JAY MAROTTA
I don’t see how you can claim that
she gets half a grant dedicated to
his genius.
NORA
He became a genius during the
course of the marriage.
JAY MAROTTA
Oh, come on, Nora.
NORA
Charlie, himself, upon
hearing he received the
prize, told Nicole it
belonged to her too.
JAY MAROTTA
That’s something people say when
they win awards.
NORA
No, he was implying what was true:
his genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage.
JAY MAROTTA
Nora, I like how you refer to
Charlie’s theater as a ramshackled
downtown dump when you’re arguing
custody, but when you want more
money, Charlie’s a big rich genius
Broadway director. You can’t have
it both ways.
NORA
Why not? And whether you think
it’s fair or not, Jay, the first
monetary installment from the
MacArthur grant was then put in a
joint marital account and thus
became community property so this
and any further installments
should be split between the
parties.
JAY MAROTTA
Fuck. You shouldn’t have put that
money in the joint account.
CHARLIE
There’s not going to be anything
left anyway, I’m using it all to
divorce her...
JAY MAROTTA
Nora, I have to say your account
of this marriage takes place in an
alternate reality. By suddenly
MOVING to LA, and insisting on an
LA residence, Nicole is
withholding Henry, alienating him
from his father. This has turned
Charlie’s world upside down. It
amounts to an ambush.
NORA
Withholding, Jay? Really?
Alienating. Those are fighting
words and it is simply false and
does nothing to further our
settlement. Your recap of this
situation is outrageous.
And although California is,
without doubt, a no-fault state,
it does bear mentioning in the
accurate recap of this situation
that Charlie had had extramarital
affairs--
CHARLIE
AN extramarital affair.
NORA
Do you really want me to go there?
JAY MAROTTA
Let’s go there. Nicole has
admitted to HACKING Charlie’s
computer and reading his emails.
JAY MAROTTA
Which if proven is a felony. And
Nora, I don’t think you’ll be happy
if I start to ask Nicole about her
alcohol consumption in the evenings--
NICOLE
What?
JAY MAROTTA
She confided in Charlie one night
recently, having just carried
Henry to bed, that she was having
trouble standing while walking
down the staircase. From what I
understand this was not an
isolated event. You let me know,
Nora, otherwise we’ll go there as
needed.
NORA
Charlie, can I ask you: How can
you expect to have more time with
Henry when you don’t exercise the
time you have AND exercise it
responsibly.
NORA
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,
after failing to text, call or
communicate in any way, shape or
form, Charlie finally arrived two
hours late to pick up Henry at
Nicole’s mother’s house. At that
point the car seat which he
assured Nicole had been
professionally installed was
clearly not even belted in, just
sitting on the back seat.
Jay turns to Charlie.
JAY MAROTTA
You have to buckle the seat
in, man, it’s the law.
CHARLIE
I know that. I thought the
car rental place did it.
JAY MAROTTA
They can’t do it, it’s a
liability--
CHARLIE
I know that NOW! Once we
discovered that, we fixed
it.
MALE JUDGE
Counsel, you can see my courtroom
is full and there are people who
don’t have the resources your
clients have. And I’m fairly
certain you haven’t exhausted in
good faith the arguments in the
case of this child. In the
meantime, we’ll keep the status
quo. This remains an LA family
for the time being.
MALE JUDGE
I took over this department
recently and am still becoming
acquainted with the cases so I’m
going to appoint an expert
evaluator who knows much more
about young children than I do.
Once the evaluation is done we’ll
modify the orders where necessary.
NICOLE
Hey.
CHARLIE
Where’s Henry?
NICOLE
He’s with Cassie and her
kids at Laser Tag.
CHARLIE
You want something to drink?
CHARLIE
I have unfiltered tap water, beer
and some juice boxes.
NICOLE
I’ll have a juice box.
He goes into the kitchen. She looks at his rental place.
It makes her sad.
NICOLE
You don’t have anything on the
walls.
CHARLIE
I don’t have anything to put on
them except Henry’s art which is
being framed.
NICOLE
I can give you some things, you
know until you get some stuff...
How about that great picture of
Henry on the Staten Island Ferry--
CHARLIE
Aren’t you in that one?
NICOLE
Oh, right, I guess I am.
I guess you can cut me out?
CHARLIE
Oh, I’m going to have to
leave a day early to go to
New York on the 22nd so I
was wondering if I could
take Henry that Friday--
NICOLE
The 22nd? So, that’s the 21st?
We have plans actually. We’re
going to this thing at LACMA with
the cousins--
CHARLIE
But could you change it so I
can take him--
NICOLE
It’s only that night. He’s
looking forward to it.
CHARLIE
Really?
NICOLE
It’s my night, Charlie, we
negotiated it.
CHARLIE
OK. Fine.
NICOLE
I mean...what?
CHARLIE
No, I’m just asking you to be
flexible--
NICOLE
I AM flexible. You come in and
out and I adjust based on your
schedule. This one night we
happen to have to have tickets to
a thing. I mean...
CHARLIE
It’s not only this one night, but
fine...
NICOLE
Henry’s teacher wants to meet with
us.
CHARLIE
You mean his LA teacher--
NICOLE
Can you respond to the email
so we can set a time?
CHARLIE
Yeah, I’ve been distracted.
NICOLE
I understand. They just want to
rule out everything, you know,
with his reading.
CHARLIE
I think he’s just over-anxious. I
think he wants it so much.
NICOLE
I know, he quits too easily
if things aren’t easy for
him. You know, he’s like
us, he’s stubborn.
CHARLIE
They said he’s off the
charts in math.
NICOLE
He’s still a lousy Monopoly player
because he tries to save all his
money.
NICOLE
So... I thought we should talk.
CHARLIE
Uh huh.
NICOLE
I feel like maybe things
have gone too far.
CHARLIE
Uh huh.
NICOLE
I mean, my mom has taken out a
loan against the house to help me
pay Nora
CHARLIE
I thought I pay Nora.
NICOLE
You pay thirty percent of Nora.
CHARLIE
Well, I’m going broke too if
that’s any help. I’ve just agreed
to direct two shitty plays and we
can forget putting anything away
for Henry’s college.
NICOLE
It’s just that...up until now
we’ve been able to keep Henry at
least somewhat removed. And this
will change that.
CHARLIE
Uh huh.
NICOLE
And we have to protect him.
CHARLIE
I agree.
NICOLE
Nora says the evaluator will come
into our homes. She’ll interview
Henry in addition to us, our
family, friends, enemies... And
then she’ll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.
CHARLIE
Sounds awful.
NICOLE
I know! I feel like if anyone
observed me on any given day as a
mom, I’d never get custody.
That was a joke.
CHARLIE
I know. I feel the same way.
NICOLE
Right. So, maybe we can figure
something out between us--
CHARLIE
You’ll remember I said this to you
at the beginning.
NICOLE
I know you did, but these are
different circumstances--
CHARLIE
I was anticipating these
circumstances--
NICOLE
Mm hm. Anyway... Shall we
try this?
CHARLIE
OK.
There’s a long silence. They both laugh.
CHARLIE
I don’t know how to start...
NICOLE
Do you understand why I want to
stay in LA?
CHARLIE
No.
NICOLE
Well, that’s not...Charlie, that’s
not a useful way for us to start--
CHARLIE
I don’t understand it.
NICOLE
You don’t remember promising that
we could do time out here?
CHARLIE
We discussed things. We were
married, we said things. We
talked about moving to Europe,
about getting a sideboard or what
do you call it, a credenza, to
fill that empty space behind the
couch. We never did any of it.
NICOLE
And you turned down that
residency at the Geffen that
would have brought us here
and--
CHARLIE
It wasn’t something I
wanted. We had a great
theater company and a great
life where we were.
NICOLE
You call that a great life.
CHARLIE
You know what I mean.
NICOLE
Me discovering you’re
fucking Mary Ann--
CHARLIE
Don’t pretend you’re not
capable of deception. You
left Ben for ME.
CHARLIE
I don’t mean we had a great
marriage. I mean, life in
Brooklyn... Professionally. I
don’t know. Honestly I never
considered anything different.
NICOLE
Well, that’s the problem isn’t it?
I was your wife, you should have
considered my happiness too.
CHARLIE
Come on! You WERE happy. You’ve
just decided you weren’t now--
NICOLE
So, OK, let’s... I work here now.
My family is here.
CHARLIE
And I agreed to put Henry in
school here because your show went
to series. I did that KNOWING
that when you were done shooting,
he would come back to New York...
NICOLE
Honey, we never said that. That
might have been your assumption,
but we never expressly said
that...
CHARLIE
We did say it.
NICOLE
When did we say it?
CHARLIE
I don’t know when we said it, but
we said it!
NICOLE
I thought--
CHARLIE
We said it that time on the
phone--
NICOLE
Let me finish. Honey--
Sorry, I keep saying THAT.
I thought...that if Henry was
happy out here and my show
continued, that we might do LA for
a while.
CHARLIE
I was not privy to that thought
process.
NICOLE
The only reason we didn’t live
here was because you can’t imagine
desires other than your own unless
they’re forced on you.
CHARLIE
OK, you wish you hadn’t married
me, you wish you’d had a different
life. But this is what happened.
NICOLE
So what do we do?
CHARLIE
I don’t know.
NICOLE
Nora says there’s no coming back
from this.
CHARLIE
Fuck Nora. I hate fucking Nora
telling me I always lived in LA
even though I never lived in LA.
How could you have her say those
things about me?
NICOLE
Jay said them about me too!
You shouldn’t have fired Bert.
CHARLIE
I needed my own asshole!
NICOLE
Let’s both agree both of our
lawyers have said shitty stuff
about both of us--
CHARLIE
Nora was worse.
NICOLE
Jay called me an alcoholic!
CHARLIE
You pulled the rug out from
under me and you’re putting
me through hell--
NICOLE
You put me through hell
DURING the marriage!
CHARLIE
Is that what that was?
Hell?
NICOLE
And now you're going to put Henry
through this horrible thing so you
can yet again get what you want.
119.
CHARLIE
It’s not what I want...I mean,
it’s what I want, but it’s what
was...WAS...what’s best for him.
NICOLE
I was wondering when you’d get
around to Henry and what HE
actually wants.
CHARLIE
Oh, fuck off--
NICOLE
No, YOU fuck off. If you listened
to your son, or anyone, he’d tell
you he’d rather live here.
CHARLIE
Stop putting your feelings
about me onto Henry.
NICOLE
He tells me he likes it here
better.
CHARLIE
He tells you because he knows it’s
what you want to HEAR!
NICOLE
He tells me you’re on the phone
all the time. You don’t even play
with him.
CHARLIE
Because I’m going through a
divorce in LA and trying to
direct a play in New York.
NICOLE
You’re fighting for
something you don’t even
WANT.
CHARLIE
Which closed because I wasn’t
THERE! That was a HUGE
opportunity for me. For the
theater. And I let everyone down.
NICOLE
You’re being so much like your
father.
CHARLIE
DO NOT compare me to my father.
NICOLE
I didn’t compare you. I said you
were acting like him.
CHARLIE
You’re exactly like your mother!
Everything you complain about her,
you’re doing. You’re suffocating
Henry.
NICOLE
First of all, I love my
mother, she was a great
mother!
CHARLIE
I’m just repeating what
you’ve told me--
NICOLE
Secondly, how dare you compare my
mothering to my mother? I might
be like my father, but I’m NOT
like my mother.
CHARLIE
You ARE! And you’re like my
father. You’re also like MY
mother. You’re all the bad things
about all of these people. But
mostly your mother. When we would
lie in bed together, sometimes I
would look at you and see HER and
just feel so GROSS.
NICOLE
I felt repulsed when you touched
me.
CHARLIE
You’re a slob. I made all
the beds, closed all the
cabinets, picked up after
you like an infant--
NICOLE
The thought of having sex
with you makes me want to
peel my skin off.
CHARLIE
You’ll never be happy. In LA or
anywhere. You’ll think you found
some better, opposite guy than me
and in a few years you’ll rebel
against him because you need to
have your VOICE. But you don’t
WANT a voice. You just want to
fucking complain about not having
a VOICE.
NICOLE
I think of being married to you
and that woman is a stranger to
me.
CHARLIE
You’ve regressed. You’ve
gone back to your life
before you met me. It’s
pathetic.
NICOLE
We had a child’s marriage.
NICOLE
People used to say to me that you
were too selfish to be a great
artist. I used to defend you.
But they’re absolutely right.
CHARLIE
All your best acting is
behind you. You’re back to
being a HACK.
NICOLE
You gaslighted me. You’re a
fucking villain.
CHARLIE
You want to present yourself as a
victim because it’s a good legal
strategy, FINE. But you and I
both know you CHOSE this life.
You wanted it until you didn’t.
Nicole is silent.
CHARLIE
You USED me so you could get out
of LA.
NICOLE
I didn’t use you--
CHARLIE
You did and then you BLAMED
me for it. You always made
me aware of what I was doing
wrong, how I was falling
short.
CHARLIE
Life with you was JOYLESS.
NICOLE
So you had to fuck someone else?
How could you?
CHARLIE
You shouldn’t be upset that I
fucked her, you should be upset
that I had a laugh with her.
NICOLE
Do you love her?
CHARLIE
No! But she didn’t hate me. You
hated me.
NICOLE
You hated ME. You fucked someone
we worked with.
CHARLIE
You stopped having sex with me in
the last year. I never cheated on
you.
NICOLE
That was cheating on me.
CHARLIE
But there’s so much I could have
done. I was a director in my 20’s
who came from nothing and was
suddenly on the cover of fucking
Time Out New York. I was hot
shit—-and I wanted to fuck
EVERYBODY and I didn’t. And I
loved you and didn’t want to lose
you...and I’m in my twenties and I
didn’t want to lose that too. And
you wanted SO much so fast...I
didn’t even want to get
married...and fuck it, there’s so
much I DIDN’T do.
NICOLE
Well, thanks for that.
CHARLIE
You’re welcome. You’re...welcome.
Nicole stamps her feet and shakes her fists like a child
having a tantrum.
NICOLE
I can’t believe I have to know you
FOREVER!
CHARLIE
You’re fucking insane!
CHARLIE
And you’re fucking winning.
123.
NICOLE
Are you kidding? I wanted to be
married. I’d ALREADY LOST.
You didn’t love me as much as I
loved you.
CHARLIE
What does that have to do with LA?
Nicole stares at him, incredulous.
CHARLIE
What?
NICOLE
You’re so merged with your
own selfishness that you
don’t even identify it as
selfishness anymore. YOU’RE
SUCH A DICK.
CHARLIE
Every day I wake up and hope
you’re dead-- Dead like--
CHARLIE
If I could guarantee Henry would
be OK, I’d hope you get an illness
and then get hit by a car and DIE.
NICOLE
I know.
CHARLIE
I’m sorry.
NICOLE
Me too.
FEMALE SET
Try the chair by the window...
HENRY
Why do we have so many plants all
of a sudden?
CHARLIE
We’ll have to return some of this
stuff so don’t get too used to it.
HENRY
My mom is the last person to turn
into a plant on her show.
CHARLIE
Yeah?
HENRY
I find plants kind of scary.
CHARLIE
These plants are good guys.
Hey, tomorrow this woman is going
to come and visit us and be with
us while we eat dinner.
HENRY
Is it your girlfriend?
CHARLIE
No, no...
HENRY
Mommy’s boyfriend?
CHARLIE
No, why...does Mommy have a
boyfriend?
HENRY
I don’t know. Does she?
CHARLIE
I don’t know.
HENRY
I don’t know. Why is someone
watching us eat dinner?
CHARLIE
I know, it’s weird. It’s just
something we have to do which has
to do with Mommy and me figuring
out everything...and how we’re
going to be and...you know?
HENRY
Will you read to me?
Charlie and Henry lie down on the floor against the blank
wall and Charlie starts reading to him.
FEMALE
Any history of domestic violence?
NICOLE
Oh... No. You mean coming from
me? No. Not coming from him
either...
FEMALE
Have you been to prison?
NICOLE
Yes, actually. Well, not prison.
Jail. But it was deliberate.
FEMALE
OK.
NICOLE
I was demonstrating as part of a
Grandmothers for Peace rally. I
was with my mom, but she didn’t go
to jail. Somehow she avoided that part.
But I did.
FEMALE
Do you use drugs or alcohol?
NICOLE
I drink alcohol.
FEMALE
How much alcohol do you drink?
NICOLE
I don’t know. Glass of wine with
dinner. Sometimes more?
FEMALE
How much more?
NICOLE
Well, sometimes, a few... I
sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone?
FEMALE
OK. Who do you split it
with?
NICOLE
I mean, if I’m having dinner
with someone and we order a
bottle of wine.
FEMALE
OK.
NICOLE
You know, like if you’re at
a restaurant and you say,
“Should we go by the glass
or get a bottle?”
FEMALE
You get a bottle.
NICOLE
Sometimes! Sometimes I go by the
glass. You know, it depends...
Do you mean drugs ever? I have
done drugs. In college. I don’t
do it regularly.
FEMALE
Anything since you’ve been a
mother?
NICOLE
Pot a few times. Coke once at a
party. But Henry wasn’t with me.
FEMALE
What would you say are your
strengths as a parent?
NICOLE
I listen. I play. I put in the
time. I love taking care of him,
watching him grow up... Sometimes
it’s true what they say about it
goes so fast, but sometimes it’s
not. Sometimes it goes too slow,
honestly...
FEMALE
What are your weaknesses?
NICOLE
I’m too precise. I care too much.
FEMALE
Are those weaknesses?
NICOLE
Maybe not.
You know what, he can be an
asshole and I can get really
pissed off. I’ll call him on
being an asshole and--
NORA
I’m going to stop you there.
Don’t ever say that. People don’t
accept a mother who drinks too
much wine and yells at her child
and calls him an asshole. I get
it. I do it too.
We can accept an imperfect Dad.
Let’s face it, the idea of a good
father was only invented like 30
years ago. Before that fathers
were expected to be silent and
absent and unreliable and selfish
and we can all say that we want
them to be different but on some
basic level we ACCEPT them, we
LOVE them for their fallibilities.
But people absolutely DON’T accept
those same failings in mothers.
We don't accept it structurally
and we don't accept it spiritually
because the basis of our Judeo-Christian Whatever is Mary Mother
of Jesus and she’s PERFECT. She’s
a virgin who gives birth,
unwaveringly supports her child,
and holds his dead body when he’s
gone. But the Dad isn’t there.
He didn’t even do the fucking
because God’s in heaven. God is
the father and God didn't show up
so you have to be perfect and
Charlie can be a fuck up and it
doesn't matter. You’ll always be
held to a different, higher
standard and it’s FUCKED up, but
that’s the way it is.
FEMALE
I think I rang the wrong bell.
Nancy Katz.
CHARLIE
Hi, I’m Charlie Barber. Nancy,
can I get you anything?
FEMALE
Oh, I’m easy. A glass of water?
CHARLIE
It’s a new apartment.
Shall we go in here?
FEMALE
Sure. What’s a day like for the
two of you here?
CHARLIE
Well, if he has school, I take him
there, of course and pick him up,
assuming I can do both.
FEMALE
What prevents you from picking him
up?
CHARLIE
Um, you know, work. I’m preparing
a play I’m directing in a few
months.
FEMALE
Oh, what is that?
CHARLIE
Kasimir and Karoline by Odon von
Horvath? We’re doing it at the
Barrow in New York.
FEMALE
So, you have to be away?
CHARLIE
Yes. Recently, since Nicole has
been working on this show in LA, I
come back and forth a lot.
FEMALE
That sounds difficult.
CHARLIE
It is. And expensive. I’ll try
to take him with me some of the
time, but Nicole doesn’t like for
him to fly so much.
FEMALE
That can be hard on a child. All
that recycled air.
CHARLIE
Well, he’s sturdy.
FEMALE
Some parents won't take their kids
to a restaurant because of these
super bugs.
CHARLIE
Uh huh.
FEMALE
I notice on one visit to Los
Angeles, you came on a
Sunday and left on a
Thursday. Why not stay for
a weekend?
CHARLIE
Oh...on that time, I had tech for
Electra back in New York.
FEMALE
What’s that?
CHARLIE
It was my Broadway debut.
FEMALE
I don’t know what tech is.
CHARLIE
It’s the technical part of the
production. You figure out the
lights and--
FEMALE
And what’s a weekend day
like?
CHARLIE
Monday is our day off in
theater-- Well, out here he has basketball
on Saturday at 12, 11, I’m sorry
and so we go there.
And then afterwards, maybe we’ll
get lunch somewhere and then if
there’s a movie to see...
FEMALE
Does he like basketball?
CHARLIE
He does. His coach, um, Rick says
he’s a good dribbler and I’ve seen
that...
FEMALE
Uh huh.
CHARLIE
Ron. I’m sorry. His coach’s name
is Ron. Rick’s his dentist in New
York.
CHARLIE
Well, you know our home home
was...is in New York. That’s
where we live and--
FEMALE
New York is a long way from here.
CHARLIE
We like it because we can walk.
FEMALE
You can walk here.
CHARLIE
Not really.
FEMALE
And the space. Do you like your school?
HENRY
I love it.
FEMALE
What’s your favorite part about
it?
HENRY
I don’t know. Maybe gym.
CHARLIE
You like math--
HENRY
Math is boring.
Thanks.
CHARLIE
You’re welcome. But you’re
getting really good at it.
HENRY
No.
CHARLIE
Well, you are, but...
FEMALE
What do you and your Dad like to
do together?
HENRY
When I’m at my Dad’s we sometimes
watch a movie or build a Lego or
something. My Dad’s a great Lego
builder.
FEMALE
And at your mom’s?
HENRY
At home, I have most of my toys
and there’s a pool and I have a treehouse and jungle gym. We play
lots of games. We have Super
Secret Treasure Hunt which is
really fun.
Sweetheart, do you want to help me
set the table.
HENRY
Do I have to?
CHARLIE
Just come in here and grab a plate
and--
HENRY
I’m playing.
CHARLIE
Henry!
HENRY
O-K.
CHARLIE
Why are you being like this?
HENRY
What?
CHARLIE
If I ask you to help out, help
out.
HENRY
What is this?
CHARLIE
It’s special meal.
HENRY
What are the green things? There
aren’t green things in special
meal.
CHARLIE
It’s just a garnish.
HENRY
Uck.
CHARLIE
Here, I’ll take it off.
HENRY
I don’t want to eat anything it
touched.
CHARLIE
It doesn’t change the taste of
anything.
HENRY
I might want to be a vegetarian.
Mom’s a vegetarian.
CHARLIE
Is she a vegetarian now?
HENRY
Yeah.
CHARLIE
Well, then you should like
garnish. It’s all garnish,
vegetarianism.
FEMALE
She returns her water to the sink.
CHARLIE
You sure you don’t want anything?
FEMALE
No, I’m fine, thank you.
HENRY
Do the thing with the knife.
CHARLIE
No...I’m not...no.
HENRY
Come on!
CHARLIE
It’s not a dinner thing.
CHARLIE
It’s not an anytime thing.
FEMALE
What’s the thing with the knife?
HENRY
It’s hilarious.
CHARLIE
No...it’s dumb. I have a small
knife on my keychain. Which is
only for adults. I do a thing
with it sometimes...
HENRY
You said I could get a knife.
CHARLIE
A jack-knife, yeah. When you’re
older.
HENRY
Like ten.
CHARLIE
No, like twenty.
HENRY
Yeah.
Dime, rime, lime, pime, sime--
CHARLIE
Honey, stop guessing. You’re so
close, stay with it.
HENRY
Ugh, I don’t want to do it.
CHARLIE
What’s the first letter?
HENRY
I don’t want to do it. Can I do
the iPad?
CHARLIE
No. Just look, what’s the first
letter?
HENRY
I don’t want to.
CHARLIE
It’s a T. What sound does T
make.
HENRY
Tuh.
CHARLIE
Right and then just do the rest of
it.
HENRY
Dime.
CHARLIE
No! You have “Tuh” and “ime.”
What is that?
CHARLIE
Time. It’s time. You’ll see, honey, one day it’s
just going to click and you’ll be
able to read everything.
HENRY
I need a break. Can I play in my
room?
CHARLIE
Sure. Do you ever observe married
people?
FEMALE
No, why would I?
CHARLIE
I was kidding.
FEMALE
Oh.
CHARLIE
The knife thing is, I carry this
knife on my keychain which his
mother got me actually--
CHARLIE
--and I’d do this thing for his mom--
He clicks open the knife.
CHARLIE
Where I pretend to cut myself, but
I retract the blade-- But I don’t do it with him...
CHARLIE
Oh...that’s fine.
FEMALE
Are you OK?
CHARLIE
Yeah, I must not have retracted
the blade all the way.
FEMALE
Do you need--
CHARLIE
Yeah...yeah. No! I’m fine.
What else can I tell you?
FEMALE
I think I have enough.
CHARLIE
You got enough?
FEMALE
Are you sure you’re OK?
CHARLIE
Totally. I’m fine.
FEMALE
Well, I’ll leave you guys for
tonight.
CHARLIE
Oh, OK...
FEMALE
I’ll be in touch if I have further
questions. Thanks. Thank you for the water.
CHARLIE
Oh, yeah, sure.
FEMALE
You’re sure you’re OK?
CHARLIE
Yeah!
FEMALE
Bye bye.
CHARLIE
Bye.
CHARLIE
Oh, let me-- I think you turned--
CHARLIE
Sorry.
HENRY
Dad, are you OK?
CHARLIE
Yeah, I’m just tired.
HENRY
Dad, did she like us?
CHARLIE
Yeah, she thought we were great.
NORA
Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!
You could drive a person crazy,
You could drive a person mad.
First you make a person hazy
So a person could be had,
Then you leave a person dangling sadly
Outside your door,
Which could only make a person gladly
Want you even more.
I could understand a person
If it's not a person's bag.
I could understand a person
If he meant as a gag.
But worse 'n that,
A person that
Titillates a person and then leaves her flat
Is crazy,
He's a troubled person,
He's a truly crazy person himself.
When a person's personality is personable,
He should not sit like a lump.
It's harder than a matador coercin' a bull
To try to get you off of your rump.
So single and attentive and attractive a man
Is everything a person could wish,
But turning off a person is the act of a man
Who likes to pull the hooks out of fish.
Knock-knock! Is anybody there?
Knock-knock! It really isn't fair.
Knock-knock! I'm workin' all my charms.
Knock-knock! A zombie's in my arms.
All that sweet affection!
What is wrong?
Where's the loose connection?
How long, O Lord, how long?
Bobby-baby-Bobby-bubbi-Bobby,
You could drive a person buggy,
You could blow a person's cool.
Like you make a person feel all huggy
While you make her feel a fool.
When a person says that you upset her,
That's when you're good.
You impersonate a person better
Than a zombie should.
I could understand a person
If he wasn't good in bed.
I could understand a person
If he actually was dead.
Exclusive you!
Elusive you!
Will any person ever get the juice of you?
You're crazy,
You're a lovely person,
You're a moving,
Deeply maladjusted,
Never to be trusted,
Crazy person yourself.
NORA
I want your mom!
NICOLE
Oh really? Yeah-- So, because Charlie dropped his
claim to New York, we’re mostly
done. Jay’s lost interest and
Ted, his associate, is doing the
paper work.
NICOLE
And we’re not taking any money,
right?
NORA
We withdrew the claim for the
MacArthur, which I think we could
have gotten by the way, and
they’re not asking for any of the
show.
NICOLE
OK, good. Thank you for
everything, Nora
NORA
You’re welcome, doll.
And when Charlie’s in LA, I got
the custody breakdown to be 55/45,
so you’ll have Henry one extra day
every two weeks...
NICOLE
I thought we made it equal.
NORA
I tweaked it at the last minute.
I just didn’t want him to be able
to say he got 50/50.
NICOLE
But I don’t--
NORA
Bragging to his friends.
NICOLE
--want to do that.
NORA
Take it! You won.
NICOLE
Uh huh.
ASPCA GUY
You look like a guy who really
cares about animals--
CHARLIE
Nope.
CHARLIE
...and the couch was technically
hers pre-marriage, but, I mean, it
was OUR couch, it’s not like I was
going to BUY another couch but
then when it comes time to split,
it’s suddenly HER couch and I have
no couch and-- I’m sitting on the
floor is the short version. I’m sorry. This is all so selfpitying and boring.
TERRY
Oh, no, no, sounds really
tough.
CHARLIE
No, it’s all stupid. I’m
sorry.
MARY ANN
No, it’s sad.
CHARLIE
Someone to hold me too close.
Someone to hurt me too deep.
Someone to sit in my chair,
And ruin my sleep,
And make me aware,
Of being alive.
Being alive.
Somebody need me too much.
Somebody know me too well.
Somebody pull me up short,
And put me through hell,
And give me support,
For being alive.
Make me alive.
Make me alive.
Make me confused.
Mock me with praise.
Let me be used.
Vary my days.
But alone,
Is alone,
Not alive.
Somebody crowd me with love.
Somebody force me to care.
Somebody let me come through,
I'll always be there,
As frightened as you,
To help us survive,
Being alive.
Being alive.
Being alive!
Hello?
Hello?
CARTER
You’ll never take me!
CHARLIE
Hi. Sorry, the door was open.
CARTER
Shhh.
CHARLIE
Oh...OK.
SANDRA
I got you!
SANDRA
Charlie, hi.
CARTER
Carter.
CHARLIE
Charlie.
CARTER
Nicole’s still at work.
CHARLIE
Hi.
HENRY
Hi.
CHARLIE
Can I get a hug?
CARTER
How’d it go?
NICOLE
Good. Donny’s dead now. I shot
the scene where he merges with the
ficus.
CARTER
She got an Emmy nomination!
CHARLIE
She’s a great actress.
NICOLE
No, for directing!
CHARLIE
Congratulations.
NICOLE
I love it. Now I know what you
were so obsessed with all the
time.
We should get ready!
We’re the Beatles.
CHARLIE
I didn’t really get a costume
together.
CARTER
You can be George Martin.
CHARLIE
I don’t need to be anything.
CARTER
You got to be something--
NICOLE
At least a ghost! I’ll get
you a sheet--
NICOLE
We should leave soon! I’m saying
that as much for me as anyone
else.
CHARLIE
I wanted to tell you, I took a
residency at UCLA. I’m going to
direct two plays in rep at Red
Cat.
NICOLE
Oh...
CHARLIE
So, I’ll be here for a while.
NICOLE
That’s great.
But something strikes her as sad about it too.
CHARLIE
You OK?
NICOLE
Yeah. It’s only good.
HENRY
“Charlie is...in...cr...” --
something -- ”neat and I re-ly on
him to keep things in or-der.
He’s energy con...” -- I don’t
know what that word is --
CHARLIE
You’re getting so good at reading.
What is that?
HENRY
“He doesn’t look in the mirror too
of-ten. He cries eas-ily in
movies...”
HENRY
“He is very self-suf--”
CHARLIE
Self-sufficient.
HENRY
“--he can dar-n a sock--"
CHARLIE
That means sew, like a hole--
HENRY
“--and cook himself dinner
and ir--”
CHARLIE
Break it into two parts.
HENRY
Ur. On.
CHARLIE
Not “ur” but “ire”
HENRY
Ire. On.
CHARLIE
Iron.
HENRY
“--a shirt. He rarely gets defeated (which I fell...feel like I
al-ways do). Charlie takes all of
my moods stead-ily, he doesn’t
give in to them or make me feel
bad about them. He’s a great
dress-er, he never looks em--” I
don’t know this one...
CHARLIE
Embarrassing.
HENRY
“--embarrassing wh-ich is hard for
a man.” You read it now...
CHARLIE
“He loves being a dad, he loves
all the things you’re supposed to
hate, like the tantrums, the
waking up at night-- He
disappears into his own world. He
and Henry are alike in that way.
He can tell people they have food
in their teeth or on their face in
a way that doesn’t make them feel
bad. Charlie is self-made -- his
parents -- I only met them once --
but he told me there was--
He’s brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around. With the
theatre company he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included.
No one, not even an intern was
unimportant.”
HENRY
What’s an intern?
CHARLIE
Like a helper. But who isn’t
paid.
HENRY
Why aren’t they paid?
CHARLIE
They’re young. They’re
learning... I don’t know, maybe
if they do a good job, they get
paid later?
HENRY
OK. Keep going.
CHARLIE
“He could remember all the inside
jokes. He’s extremely organized
and thorough. He’s very clear
about what he wants unlike me who
can’t always tell. I fell in love
with him two seconds after I saw
him and I’ll never stop loving
him...even though it doesn’t make
sense anymore.”
NICOLE
We were going to bring him to
dinner, but he’s wiped out. Do
you want to take him?
CHARLIE
It’s your night...
NICOLE
I know.
CHARLIE
Yeah.
NICOLE
OK, good.
CHARLIE
I’ll drop him back in the
morning?
NICOLE
Yeah, just text when you’re
up and we’ll figure it out.
NICOLE
You’re going to go with your Dad,
OK?
HENRY
OK.
The boy wraps his arms around his Dad’s neck and Charlie
lifts him.
NICOLE
I love you, sweetheart.
HENRY
I love you.
NICOLE
Wait--
Can you--
CHARLIE
Thanks.
