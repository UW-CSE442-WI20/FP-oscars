SERGEANT SANDERS (O.S.)
Blake.
SERGEANT SANDERS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Blake!
BLAKE
Sorry, Sarge.
SERGEANT SANDERS
Pick a man, bring your kit.
BLAKE
Yes, Sarge.
SERGEANT SANDERS (O.S.)
Don’t dawdle.
BLAKE
No, Sarge.
Did they feed us?
SCHOFIELD
No, just mail.
BLAKE
Myrtle’s having puppies.
You get anything?
SCHOFIELD
No.
BLAKE
I’m bloody starving, aren’t you? I
thought we might get some decent
grub out here - only reason I
decided against the priesthood.
What you got there?
SCHOFIELD
Ham and bread.
BLAKE
Where did you find that?
SCHOFIELD
I have my uses.
SCHOFIELD
Here.
BLAKE
Tastes like old shoe.
SCHOFIELD
Cheer up. This time next week it’ll
be chicken dinner.
BLAKE
Not me. Leave got cancelled.
SCHOFIELD
They say why?
BLAKE
No idea.
SCHOFIELD
It’s easier not to go back at all.
BLAKE
Something’s up.
Did you hear anything?
SCHOFIELD
No.
BLAKE
Has to be the push, right?
Ten bob says we’re going up.
SCHOFIELD
I’m not taking that bet.
BLAKE
Why? ‘Cos you know I’m right?
SCHOFIELD
No. ‘Cos you haven’t got ten bob.
SERGEANT SANDERS
In your own time, gentlemen...
BLAKE
Is there news, Sarge?
SERGEANT SANDERS
News of what?
BLAKE
The big push. It was supposed to
happen weeks ago. They told us we’d
be home by Christmas.
SERGEANT SANDERS
Yes, well, sorry to disrupt your
crowded schedule, Blake, but the
Brass Hats didn’t fancy it in the
snow.
BLAKE
More’s the pity Sarge, I could have
done with some turkey.
SERGEANT SANDERS
Well, I’ll make sure to relay your
displeasure to command.
SCHOFIELD
So what’s on the cards then,
Sergeant?
SERGEANT SANDERS
The Hun are up to something.
SCHOFIELD
Any idea what?
SERGEANT SANDERS
No - but it’s bound to ruin our
weekend.
Now listen, Erinmore is inside, so
tidy yourselves up.
You never know - might be mentions
in dispatches for this one, if you
don’t bugger it up.
BLAKE
Must be something big if the
General’s here.
SERGEANT SANDERS
Lance Corporals Blake and
Schofield, Sir.
GENERAL ERINMORE
Which one of you is Blake?
BLAKE
Sir.
ERINMORE
You have a brother, a Lieutenant in
the 2nd Devons?
BLAKE
Yes, sir. Joseph Blake. Is he
ERINMORE
Alive, as far as I know. And with
your help I’d like to keep it that
way.
Sanders tells me you’re good with
maps. That true?
BLAKE
Good enough, Sir.
ERINMORE
So.
We are here. The 2nd Devons are
advancing here.
How long will it take you to get
there?
BLAKE
I don’t understand, Sir.
SCHOFIELD
Sir, that land is held by the
Germans.
ERINMORE
Germans have gone.
Don’t get your hopes up. It appears
to be a strategic withdrawal. They
seem to have created a new line,
nine miles back here, by the looks
of it.

Colonel Mackenzie is in command of
the 2nd. He sent word yesterday
morning that he was going after the
retreating Germans. He is convinced
he has them on the run - that if he
can break their lines now, he will
turn the tide. He is wrong.
Colonel Mackenzie has not seen
these aerials of the enemy’s new
line.
Come round here, Gentlemen.
Three miles deep. Field
fortifications, defences and
artillery the like of which we’ve
never seen before.

The 2nd are due to attack the line
shortly after dawn tomorrow. They
have no idea what they are in for.
And we can’t warn them - as a
parting gift, the enemy cut all our
telephone lines.
Your orders are to get to the 2nd
at Croisilles Wood, one mile south
east of the town of Ecoust.
Deliver this to Colonel Mackenzie.
It is a direct order to call off
tomorrow morning’s attack.
If you don’t, it will be a
massacre. We would lose two
battalions. Sixteen hundred men,
your brother among them.
Do you think you can get there in
time?
BLAKE
Yes, Sir.
ERINMORE
Any questions?
BLAKE
No, Sir.
ERINMORE
Good. Over to you, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT GORDON
Supplies, Gentlemen.

Map, torches, grenades, and a
couple of little treats.

Leave immediately, take this trench
west, up on Sauchiehall Street,
then north west on Paradise Alley
at the front. Continue along the
front line until you find the
Yorks.
Give this note to Major Stevenson.
He’s holding the line at the
shortest span of No Man’s Land.
You’ll cross there.
SCHOFIELD
It will be daylight, Sir. They’ll
see us.
ERINMORE (O.C.)
No need to be concerned. You should
meet no resistance.
SCHOFIELD
Sir, is it just us?
ERINMORE
“Down to Gehenna or up to the
Throne"
He travels the fastest who travels
alone.”
Wouldn’t you say, Lieutenant?
LIEUTENANT GORDON
Yes, Sir. I would.
ERINMORE
Good luck.
SCHOFIELD
Blake - let’s talk about this for a
minute.
BLAKE
Why?
SCHOFIELD
Blake!
We just need to think about it
BLAKE 
There’s nothing to think about. It’s my big brother.
SCHOFIELD
We should at least wait till it’s
dark
BLAKE
Erinmore said to leave immediately.
SCHOFIELD
Erinmore’s never seen No Man’s
Land. We won’t make it ten yards.
If we just wait
BLAKE
You heard him. He said the Boche
have gone.
SCHOFIELD
Is that why he gave us grenades?
SERGEANT
Watch where you’re going!
SCHOFIELD
Sorry.
All I’m saying is that we wait.
BLAKE
Yes, you would say that, because
it’s not your brother, is it?
SCHOFIELD
Look, the last time I was told the
Germans were gone, it didn’t end
well.
You don’t know, Blake, you weren’t
there.
BLAKE
Excuse me... Excuse me!
SERGEANT MILLER
You’re going up a down trench you
bloody idiots.
BLAKE
Orders of the General, Sir.
SCHOFIELD
Alright, say the Boche have gone. Nine miles will take us, what, six
hours? Eight at the very most. So
we’ve got time to wait until the
sun sets. Otherwise we’ll be wide
open
BLAKE
It’s enemy territory, we’ve got no
idea what we’re walking into
SCHOFIELD
Blake, if we’re not clever about
this, no one will get to your
brother.
BLAKE
I will.
SCHOFIELD
We’re here. This is the front line.
BLAKE
Now we need to find the Yorks.
PRIVATE STOKES (O.S.)
Here, watch who you’re shoving.
BLAKE (O.S.)
Get out of the way then.
Let go.
PRIVATE STOKES
Fuck you think you are, pushing
wounded men around?
BLAKE
Let go of me!
SCHOFIELD
Stop.
PRIVATE STOKES
Arsehole knocked our Sergeant down, the man’s fucking woundedBeside them an NCO with a sling on, is being helped out of
the mud.
BLAKE
Alright. I’m sorry, alright, I’m
sorry.
SCHOFIELD
We’re on commission. Orders from
the General.
BLAKE
Let me through.
SCHOFIELD
Get out of the way.
PRIVATE STOKES
Right. Just watch where you’re
going.
SCHOFIELD
It’s bloody quiet...
A beat. Blake looks at Schofield.
BLAKE
Was it like this before Thiepval?
SCHOFIELD
I don’t remember.
BLAKE
You don’t remember the Somme?
SCHOFIELD
Not really.
BLAKE
Well, you did alright out of it. At
least wear your ribbon.
Beat.
SCHOFIELD
Don’t have it anymore.
BLAKE
What? You lost your medal?
SCHOFIELD
Stay low.
NCO HARVEY
God’s sake. Careful there, you’re
stepping on the dead.
That’s our Sergeant -
Be better washing them out of this
dugout with a bloody hose.
BLAKE
Do you know where the Yorks are?
NCO HARVEY
The next bend you’ll be standing on
top of half of them. Shot to hell
two nights ago.
SCHOFIELD
Yorks?
PRIVATE BUCHANAN
Yes, Corp.
BLAKE
Where’s Major Stevenson?
PRIVATE BUCHANAN
Killed a couple of nights ago,
Corporal. Lieutenant Leslie has
command.
BLAKE
Where can we find him?
PRIVATE BUCHANAN
Next dug-out.
SCHOFIELD
Here.
BLAKE
Sir?
Lieutenant Leslie, Sir?
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
What is it?
BLAKE
We have a message from General
Erinmore.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Are you our relief?
SCHOFIELD
No, Sir.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Then when the fucking hell are they
due?
BLAKE
We don’t know, Sir. But we’ve got
orders to cross here.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
That is the German front line.
BLAKE
We know, Sir. If you’ll just take
the letter
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Settle a bet, what day is it?
SCHOFIELD
Friday.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Friday. Well, well, well. None of
us was right. This idiot thought it
was Tuesday.
Are they out of their fucking
minds?
One slow night, and the brass think
the Hun have just gone home.
SCHOFIELD
Do you think they’re wrong, Sir?
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
We lost an officer and three men
two nights ago. They were shot to
bits patching up wire. We dragged
two of them back here. Needn’t have
bothered.
BLAKE
Sir, the General is sure the enemy
have withdrawn. There are aerials
of the new line
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Shut up. We’ve fought and died over
every inch of this fucking place,
now they suddenly give us miles?
It’s a trap.
But, chin up. There’s a medal in it
for sure. Nothing like a scrap of
ribbon to cheer up a widow.
Alright.
BLAKE
Where’s the nearest way through,
Sir?
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Our wire’s a mess. But there is a
path through. Of sorts.
Rushworth! Let him look.
Straight ahead, to the left, past
the dead horses
There’s a gap directly behind them. Useful, because if it’s dark you
follow the stench. When you get to
the second wire, look out for the
bowing chap. There’s small break
just beside him.
The German line is a hundred and
fifty odd yards after that. Watch
out for the craters. They’re deeper
than they look. You fall in, there’s no getting out.
This way.
Wake up, Kilgour.
Bloody waste of space.
SCHOFIELD
Any cover, Sir? Anywhere to jump
off from?
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
No. The sap trench was blown to
hell weeks ago. It’s full of bodies
anyway. Your best bet is to pop
over here.
If you do get shot, try to make it
back to the wire. We won’t come
after you, not until it’s dark.
And, if by some fucking miracle you
do make it, send up a flare.
SCHOFIELD
Don’t have any, Sir.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Well get him one, Kilgour! Make
yourself useful.
PRIVATE KILGOUR
Yes, Sir.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
“Through this holy unction may the
Lord pardon thee whatever sins or
faults thou hast committed”
I do hate losing these to the Hun.
So when they start shooting at you,
could you be so kind as to throw it
back, there’s a good chap.
Cheerio.
SCHOFIELD
You sure?
BLAKE
Yes.
SCHOFIELD
Age before beauty.

BLAKE (O.C.)
You alright?
SCHOFIELD
Look for cover.
Sap trench.
Stay still.
They’re ours.
Blake nods.
Keep going. We’re half way.

BLAKE
There’s a gap in the wire.
Sco...
There! That’s the front line.
Fuck me. They really have gone.

BLAKE
Your hand alright?
SCHOFIELD
Put it through an effing German.

BLAKE
Patch it up. You’ll be wanking
again in no time.
SCHOFIELD
Wrong hand.
They’re not long gone.
BLAKE
No good.
SCHOFIELD
Blocked.
BLAKE
This might be a way through.
Jesus...
BLAKE
Look at this. It’s massive.
They built all this.
SCHOFIELD
Here’s our way through.
BLAKE (O.C.)
Sco - how about this?
Bloody hell... Even their rats are
What do you think’s in the bags?
SCHOFIELD
You cannot be that hungry.
BLAKE
Look at him. Cocky little bastard.
SCHOFIELD
You could eat this, though.
BLAKE
What is it?
SCHOFIELD
Boche dog meat.
BLAKE
What’s in the other boxes?
What’s wrong?
SCHOFIELD
Trip wire.
Don’t move.
BLAKE
Where is it?
SCHOFIELD
Goes from here to the door.
BLAKE
Jesus!
No...no! -
Sco?!
Sco!
Sco! Sco!
Sco! Wake up! Wake up! Sco!
Sco... Stand up! Stand up! Up! Up!
stand up!
The whole thing’s coming down.
You keep hold of me!
BLAKE
We need to keep moving. Come on!
SCHOFIELD
I can’t see - I can’t see!
BLAKE
Stop! Stop!
Stop. It’s a mineshaft.
We’ll have to jump. Come on!
You’re going to have to jump! Just
jump.
SCHOFIELD
I can’t- I can’t see!
BLAKE
You need to trust me. Jump!
Don’t let go of me! Don’t let go!
Light! There’s light!

SCHOFIELD
Stop... stop. Just...just let me
stand.
BLAKE
Dirty bastards.
Careful, they may have left other
traps.
Jesus.
SCHOFIELD
Dust... so much dust in my eyes.
I wish I’d shot that rat now.
SCHOFIELD
And I wish you’d picked some other
bloody idiot.
BLAKE
What?
SCHOFIELD
Why in God’s name did you have to
choose me?
BLAKE
I didn’t know what I was picking
you for.
SCHOFIELD
No, you didn’t. You never know. That’s your problem.
BLAKE
Alright then, go back. Nothing’s
stopping you. You can go all the
way bloody home if you want.
SCHOFIELD
Don’t.
BLAKE
Look, I didn’t know what I was
picking you for. I thought they
were going to send us back up the
line, or for food, or something. I
thought it was going to be
something easy, alright? I never
thought it would be this.
So do you want to go back?
SCHOFIELD
Just fire the fucking flare.
BLAKE
Up yours, Lieutenant...
SCHOFIELD
Do you know where we are?
BLAKE
Ecoust is directly south east. If
we keep that bearing, we should
make it.
Come on then.
Look at that. They destroyed their
own guns...
SCHOFIELD
They destroyed their own trenches
too.
BLAKE
What do you mean?
SCHOFIELD
I think they wanted us to go that
way. They wanted to bury us.
BLAKE
Bastard rats.
Hey - did you hear that story about
Wilko? How he lost his ear?
SCHOFIELD
I’m not in the mood. Keep your eyes
on the trees, top of the ridge.
BLAKE
Bet he told you it was shrapnel.
SCHOFIELD
What was it then?
BLAKE
Well, you know his girl’s a
hairdresser, right? And he was
moaning about the lack of bathing
facilities when he wrote to her -
remember those rancid jakes at
Arras?
Anyway, she sends him over this
‘hair oil’. Smells sweet, like
Golden Syrup. Wilko loves the
smell, but he doesn’t want to cart
it around in his pack, so
BLAKE
He slathers it all over his barnet, goes to sleep and in the middle of
the night he wakes up, and a rat is
sitting on his shoulder licking the
oil off of his head!

Wilko panics and he jumps up and
when he does - the rat bites clean
through his fucking ear and runs
off with it!

Best of it was he put so much
bloody oil on himself that he
couldn’t wash it off! He was like a
magnet. Rats left us alone, but
they couldn’t get enough of him.
Poor bastard.
SCHOFIELD
Heading back home.

I wonder what they saw...
BLAKE
Watch the ridge lines.
SCHOFIELD
Well that’s your medal sorted then.
BLAKE
What do you mean?
SCHOFIELD 
“Lance Corporal Blake showed
unusual valour in rescuing a
comrade from certain death” blah,
blah, blah.
BLAKE
You reckon?
SCHOFIELD
I do.
BLAKE
Well, that’d be nice. Since you
lost yours.
SCHOFIELD
I didn’t lose mine.
BLAKE
What happened to it, then?
SCHOFIELD
Why do you care?
BLAKE
Why do you not?
Beat.
SCHOFIELD
I swapped it with a French captain.
BLAKE
Swapped it? For what?
SCHOFIELD
Bottle of wine.
BLAKE
What did you do that for?
SCHOFIELD
I was thirsty.
BLAKE
What a waste. (beat)
You should have taken it home with
you, you should have given it to
your family.
Men have died for that.
If I got a medal, I’d take it back
home, why didn’t you just take it
home
SCHOFIELD
Look it’s just a bit of bloody tin!
It doesn’t make you special, it
doesn’t make any difference to
anyone.
BLAKE
Yes it does.
And it’s not just a bit of tin.
(then)
It’s got a ribbon on it.
SCHOFIELD
I hated going home. I hated it.
When I knew I couldn’t stay. When I
knew I had to leave them, and they
might never see me
SCHOFIELD
Jesus. They chopped them all down.

BLAKE
Cherries.
Lamberts.
They might be Dukes, hard to tell
when they aren’t in fruit.
SCHOFIELD
What’s the difference?
BLAKE
Well people think there’s one type,
but there’s lots of them -
Cuthberts, Queen Annes,
Montmorencys. Sweet ones, sour
ones...
SCHOFIELD
Why on earth would you know this?
BLAKE
Mum’s got an orchard, back home. Only a few trees. This time of year
it looks like it’s been snowing, blossom everywhere. And then in
May, we have to pick them. Me and
Joe. Takes the whole day.
SCHOFIELD
So, these ones all gonners?
BLAKE
Oh no, they’ll grow again when the
stones rot. You’ll end up with more
trees than before.
It looks abandoned.
SCHOFIELD
Let’s hope so.
BLAKE
We have to make sure.
SCHOFIELD
I’ll take front, you take back.
BLAKE
Anything?
SCHOFIELD
Nothing.
BLAKE
Did you find any food?
SCHOFIELD
No.
I don’t like this place.
BLAKE
Map says we get over that ridge and
it’s a straight shot to Ecoust.
SCHOFIELD
Good.

BLAKE (O.S.)
Is that our friends again?
SCHOFIELD
Looks like it. Dogfight.
BLAKE
Who’s winning?
SCHOFIELD
Us, I think. Two on one.
BLAKE
They got him...
PILOT
Meine beine! Meine beine!
Hilf mir! Hilf mir!
PILOT
My legs! My legs! Help me!
Help me!
PILOT
Lazarett, Kamerad. Bitte. Bitte. Wasser. Water.
PILOT
Military hospital, comrade. Please. Please. Water. Water.
They look down at the Pilot, shocked, unsure of what to do. Schofield turns to Blake.
SCHOFIELD
We should put him out of his
misery.
BLAKE
No. Get him some water. He needs
water.
It’s alright, you’re alright. Stay
still. Stay still...
PILOT
Bitte töte mich nicht. Ich
möchte leben.
PILOT
Please help me, I don’t want
to die.
BLAKE
Stop...Stop!
SCHOFIELD
No, no, no!
BLAKE
Bastard, bloody bastard.
Oh, God no. Oh, God no.
Jesus. Jesus, no.
SCHOFIELD
We have to stop the bleeding.
BLAKE
Stop it. Stop it!
SCHOFIELD
It’s alright, it’s going to be
alright. We’re going to stand up.
BLAKE
Yes. Yes.
No! I can’t. I can’t.
SCHOFIELD
We have to get to an Aid Post.
BLAKE
I can’t.
SCHOFIELD
I’ll carry you. It isn’t very far.
BLAKE
Just bring a doctor here.
SCHOFIELD
We can’t, we have to go together
We’re going to get up. We’re going
to get up.
BLAKE
Stop, please! Stop!
Put me down! Put me down, you
bastard, please! Put me down!
They fall backwards.
SCHOFIELD
You have to try to keep moving.
BLAKE
Let’s just sit... let me sit.
SCHOFIELD
We can’t. We have to find the 2nd.
Remember? Your brother. We have to
go now...
BLAKE
You can start on without me. I’ll
catch up.
SCHOFIELD
You can’t stay here. We have to
move, alright? We have to move.
Come on. Come on. That’s it. Come
on, come on...
Your brother. We have to find your
brother.
BLAKE
You’ll recognise him. Looks like
me...a bit older.
What are they? Are we being
shelled?
SCHOFIELD
They’re embers, the barn is on
fire.
BLAKE
I’ve been hit... What was it?
SCHOFIELD
You were stabbed.
BLAKE
Am I dying?
SCHOFIELD
Yes, I think you are.
This?
BLAKE
Inside...
Will you write to my mum for me?
SCHOFIELD
I will.
BLAKE
Tell her I wasn’t scared.
SCHOFIELD
Anything else?
BLAKE
I love them...I wish that... I wish...
Talk to me.
Tell me you know the way.
SCHOFIELD
I know the way. I’m going to head
south east until I hit Ecoust.
I’ll pass through the town and out
to the east, all the way to
Croisilles Wood.
BLAKE
It’ll be dark by then.
SCHOFIELD
That won’t bother me... I’ll find
the 2nd, I’ll give them the
message, and then I’ll find your
brother. Just like you, a little
older...

PRIVATE ATKINS
It’s alright, it’s okay.
PRIVATE PARRY
Come on, help him.
PRIVATE ATKINS
Jesus, what happened to him?
PRIVATE PARRY
Was it the plane? We saw the smoke.
SCHOFIELD
Yes.
CAPTAIN SMITH (O.S.)
Go fetch his things.
PRIVATE PARRY
Sir.
PRIVATE ATKINS
Yes, Sir.
CAPTAIN SMITH
A friend?
What are you doing here?
SCHOFIELD
I have an urgent message for the
2nd Devons. Orders to stop tomorrow
morning’s attack.
CAPTAIN SMITH
Where are they stationed?
SCHOFIELD
Just beyond Ecoust.
CAPTAIN SMITH
Come with me.
Come with me, Corporal. That’s an
order.
We’re passing through Ecoust. We
can take you some of the way.
SCHOFIELD
Sir.
COLONEL COLLINS (O.S.)
Oh, come on Sergeant. Put more men
at the base. At the trunk! It’ll be
heavier there...
CAPTAIN SMITH
Might be a tight squeeze.
COLONEL COLLINS
No. You’re not going to be able to
just lift it. Pivot the front end
to the left
Jesus. They don’t make things easy
do they. They could at least have
retreated with a bit of grace. Bastards.
CAPTAIN SMITH
Sir
COLONEL COLLINS
You’re not one of mine.
SCHOFIELD
No, Sir.
CAPTAIN SMITH
He’s got an urgent message to
deliver to the 2nd Devons, Sir.
COLONEL COLLINS
Can you get past it?
SERGEANT HARROP (O.S.)
No, Sir.
COLONEL COLLINS
Oh, for God’s sake.
Just move it!
CAPTAIN SMITH
There’s room in the casuals truck,
sir. He has orders
COLONEL COLLINS
Yes, yes, alright.
Come on now. You can get through
there sideways.
SCHOFIELD
How did you get here, Sir?
CAPTAIN SMITH
Crossed No Man’s Land just outside
Bapaume. Took us the whole night.
Bumped into a couple of Hun
stragglers on the way who made a
nuisance of themselves.
SCHOFIELD
You going up to the new line?
CAPTAIN SMITH
Attempting to. The Newfoundlands
have pushed forwards and requested
reinforcements.
I’m sorry about your friend.
May I tell you something that you
probably already know?
It doesn’t do to dwell on it.
SCHOFIELD
No, Sir.
CAPTAIN SMITH
Hop on.
Make some space there... Come on, in you get!
PRIVATE COOKE
Alright. Here we go again boys.
PRIVATE ROSSI
Welcome aboard the night bus to
fuck-knows-where.
PRIVATE COOKE
Is that a dead dog?
PRIVATE BUTLER
You got a fag?
PRIVATE ROSSI
Yeah, there you go.
PRIVATE COOKE
Butler... Oy. Carry on with that
story.
PRIVATE BUTLER
Oh yeah, Right. So. When we get off
the train, Beaufoy comes up to us
and he’s having a right go - (He attempts a posh
accent, complete with
lisp) “Lance Corporal! Whatever one does, one never lets standards slip!” Then Scott comes out of the
latrine, he wipes his hand on the
back of Beaufoy’s jacket! Shit all
down his back.
PRIVATE COOKE
Was that meant to be Captain
Beaufoy?
PRIVATE BUTLER
Oh, piss off you. You can’t do any
better.
PRIVATE COOKE
“MEN! Your rifle stocks are an
embarrassment to the entire
expeditionary force.”
SEPOY JONDALAR
You’re both bloody awful.
PRIVATE COOKE
You don’t know, you barely even
speak the bloody language.
PRIVATE MALKY
He’s got a better grasp of it than
you, Cooke.
PRIVATE COOKE
Go on then Jondalar, give it a go, let’s see it!
PRIVATE ROSSI
Let’s hear it then Jonny!
SEPOY JONDALAR
“Rossi! Never in my two hundred
years as a soldier have I seen such
a sorry excuse for a latrine pit-”
PRIVATE COOKE
Shite. That is total shit!
Oy! You could have taken my teeth
out with that.
PRIVATE ROSSI
You could do with a new set.
PRIVATE BUTLER
You got somewhere you need to be?
PRIVATE ROSSI
Oh, no...
PRIVATE COOKE
Arsehole needs driving lessons.
SCHOFIELD
He should reverse.
PRIVATE COOKE
Yeah.
SCHOFIELD
Try it in reverse. reverse.
No. Stop. STOP!
Everyone needs to get out.
All out!
Come on!
PRIVATE BUTLER
Alright, alright. Keep your bloody
hair on.
SCHOFIELD
Right. One. Two. Three.
PRIVATE COOKE
We need to get some wood, put it
under the wheels.
SCHOFIELD
No! We haven’t got the time!
We all need to push!
Come on! COME ON!
Come onnnnn!!
Please. I have to go now! Please.
PRIVATE BUTLER
Alight, come on lads! Come on.
PRIVATE ROSSI
Come on, boys!
SCHOFIELD
One. Two. Three!
ahhhhhhhhhhh!
PRIVATE ROSSI
Come on boys! One last push! Yes!
One. Two. Three!
SCHOFIELD
Back in. Get back in. Go.
SEPOY JONDALAR
Are you alright?

PRIVATE COOKE(O.S.)
Here, Driver, how about you try to
keep it on the bloody road for a
change!
DRIVER (O.S.)
Oh, piss off.

SEPOY JONDALAR
So, where are you going?
SCHOFIELD
I have to get to the 2nd Devons.
Just past Ecoust.
SEPOY JONDALAR
Why?
SCHOFIELD
They’re attacking at dawn. I have
orders to stop them.
PRIVATE MALKY
How come?
SCHOFIELD
They’re walking into a trap.
PRIVATE COOKE
How many?
SCHOFIELD
Sixteen hundred.
This stops them all.
PRIVATE COOKE
Jesus.
PRIVATE BUTLER
Why did they send you on your own?
SCHOFIELD
They didn’t. There were two of us.
PRIVATE ROSSI
So now it’s down to you.
SCHOFIELD
Yes.
PRIVATE COOKE
You’ll never make it.
SCHOFIELD
Yes. I will.
Thank you.
PRIVATE ROSSI
Look at it. Fucking look at it...
Three years fighting over this. We
should have just let the bastards
keep it. I mean, who machine guns
cows?
PRIVATE MALKY
Huns with extra bullets.
PRIVATE ROSSI
Bastards.
SEPOY JONDALAR
Clever. They know if they don’t
shoot the cow, you will eat it.
PRIVATE ROSSI
Still bastards.
PRIVATE MALKY
Yeah, it’s not even our bloody
country.
PRIVATE BUTLER
How long gone d’you reckon they
are?
SEPOY JONDALAR
Why? Worried we’ll catch up with
them?
PRIVATE BUTLER
Yeah, right. Be a bloody miracle at
this rate.
PRIVATE COOKE
They are probably right around the
next corner.
PRIVATE ROSSI
Piss off, no they’re not.
PRIVATE COOKE
Why don’t they just bloody well
give up? Eh? Don’t they want to go
home?
PRIVATE ROSSI
They hate their wives and
mothers... and Germany must be a
shit hole.
PRIVATE COOKE
They’re retreating... they’re miles
back. We’ve got them on the ropes
at least.
SEPOY JONDALAR
No. We don’t.
PRIVATE BUTLER
Oh, bollocks. What’s up now?
PRIVATE COOKE
Not another bloody tree.
DRIVER (O.S.)
Bridge is down.
PRIVATE COOKE
Oh. That’s a shame.
SCHOFIELD
Looks like I’ll be getting out
here. Good luck.
PRIVATE ROSSI
Keep some of that luck for yourself
pal. Think you’ll be needing it.
PRIVATE BUTLER
Good luck, mate.
PRIVATE MALKY
Good luck.
PRIVATE COOKE
Good luck, guv.
PRIVATE SINGER
Good luck.
PRIVATE COOKE (CONT'D)
Don’t balls it up.
SEPOY JONDALAR
I hope you get there.
SCHOFIELD
Thank you.
CAPTAIN SMITH
Next bridge is six miles. We’ll
have to divert.
SCHOFIELD
I can’t, Sir. I don’t have the
time.
CAPTAIN SMITH
Of course.
Best of luck.
SCHOFIELD
Thank you, Sir.
CAPTAIN SMITH
Corporal. If you do manage to get
to Colonel Mackenzie, make sure
there are witnesses.
SCHOFIELD
They are direct orders, Sir.
CAPTAIN SMITH
I know. But some men just want the
fight.
SCHOFIELD
Thank you, Sir.
CAPTAIN SMITH

SCHOFIELD
“They went to sea in a Sieve, they
did,
In a Sieve they went to sea:
In spite of all their friends could
say,
On a winter’s morn, on a stormy
day,
In a Sieve they went to sea.”
“Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies
live;
Their heads are green, and their
hands are blue,
And they went to sea in a Sieve.”
LAURI
Le jour. Les soldats vont
vous voir... They see you. Il
