ADELA
Manita! It’s almost one...!
CLEO
Ay, chicú...!
What’s wrong?
PEPE
I’m tired.
CLEO
Well, let’s go then so we can get
home. As soon as we get there you
can go straight to bed!
PEPE
I can’t.
PEPE 
Mom!
CLEO
Of course you can! Come on! Let’s
go!
PEPE
I said I can’t!
CLEO
If I went to bed every time I
thought “I can’t”, I would live in
bed!
PEPE
I’m not in bed.
CLEO
Come on, there’s pasta soup...
PEPE
Ooooooooooh!
PEPE 
Mooooooooooooom!
CLEO
C’mon little soldier, 1, 2, 3, 4...
march!
ADELA 
Hurry up, manita! Fermín is on the
phone!
CLEO
Hello?
ADELA
So, what did he say?
CLEO
Nothing! He just called to say hi!
ADELA
Sure... Now you’ve stolen my
boyfriend, right?
CLEO
What? You crazy? Fermín is only my
friend. Plus, you’re the one who
introduced us.
ADELA
Ay, manita! Look at you! I’m just
messing with you. I only went out
twice with him and didn’t even let
him kiss me.
CLEO
They’re here...
PACO
A friend told me that a kid in his
cousin’s school was killed by a
soldier because he threw a water
balloon at him.
TOÑO
Says who?
PACO
Says Flores. If you don’t believe
me, ask him. He says he was in
Chapultepec, near the new one, and
that he was with his brother,
throwing water balloons down at the
passing cars and so an army Jeep
passed and they threw one and the
soldier got off and shot him.
CLEO
Jesus! And what happened to him?
PACO
What do you mean, what happened? He
got shot in the head, he’s dead.
CLEO
Horrible!
SOFÍA
Hello children, what are you
eating?
SOFI
Mom!
PEPE
Mom!
PEPE
Look, mommy...
SOFÍA
Beautiful! Did you make that all by
yourself?
PEPE
Yes, and look: there’s pasta soup!
SOFÍA
Yummm, delicious!
SOFÍA 
Cleo, please don’t let the kids
touch those papers-they’re exams I
have to grade.
TOÑO
Is there any watermelon?
CLEO
No, love. Strawberries and cream.
PACO
I want some!
CLEO
What about you, Toño?
TOÑO
I guess so.
CLEO
Ándali, the señora is here. Sofía
and Toño want their strawberries...
SOFÍA
Cleo, could you please send the
señor’s two suits to the dry
cleaners. It has to be today
because he’s leaving on Friday and
has to pack them.
CLEO
Don’t worry, ma’am, I’ll take them.
PEPE
Is dad going on a trip?
SOFÍA
He’s going to Quebec for a
conference.
SOFI
Where’s that?
PACO
How come you don’t know, silly?
SOFI
I don’t. So what?
TOÑO
It’s in Canada.
PACO
Is he flying Eastern?
SOFÍA
I don’t know. I think it’s Panam.
SOFÍA 
No sugar for Sofi, or she’ll get
fat.
CLEO
You know you can’t come up here.
PACO
I looked after him the whole way
up.
CLEO
Your mom is going to be angry.
PACO
I’m going to come out of here and
you come over here, and when I get
to here you’ll shoot me, but I’ll
shoot you first and you’ll fall
dead... Like this... with your arms
wide open...
CLEO
Just don’t play next to the edge.
PACO
C’mon...
PEPE
Why aren’t you the one who dies?
PACO
Cause it’s my game.
PEPE
Then I don’t wanna play anymore.
PACO
Well, then I don’t want you to
play, sissy.
CLEO
What happened to you?
PEPE
I’m dead.
CLEO
Well, let’s go down then.
PEPE
I can’t. I’m dead.
CLEO
Then come back to life, we have to
go down!
PEPE
If you die, you can’t live again.
CLEO
Now what am I going to do without
my Pepe!?
I can’t live without my Pepe!
I’m also dead.
PEPE
Cleo...?
Cleo...?
CLEO
I’m dead.
PEPE
No! C’mon, get up!
CLEO
Didn’t you say that was impossible?
PEPE
Cleo, stop it!
PEPE 
Cleo!
Cleeoo!
Cleeeeeeeeooooooo!
CLEO
I’m playing your game. Let’s see...
shall we play a little longer?
Close your eyes.
I like being dead.
PEPE
Cleo, if you died right now, would
you go to heaven or hell?
CLEO
And why would I die?
PEPE
I’m just saying... Heaven or hell?
CLEO
You’re killing me all the time...
PEPE
Well, it’s a game! Tell me
already... heaven or hell?
CLEO
Let’s see, close your eyes...
I’d fly straight up to heaven with
my little wings.
PEPE
Paco told me that in his religion
class the had a sli-ding show...
CLEO
Sli-ding...?
SOFI
Slide show.
PEPE
That thing. About hell.
CLEO
Hell?
PEPE
Yep, paintings and photos....
CLEO
Photos?
PEPE
Yeah. He said there was fire on all
sides... and that while they burn
you, there’s some real ugly devils
poking you, like this, with
irons... and others that bite you
or eat your arms....
CLEO
Ay chicú! horrible! Stop talking
about that...!
PEPE
Yeah but it doesn’t matter...!
CLEO
What do you mean it doesn’t matter?
What about all the fire?
PEPE
He says it doesn’t matter cause
that’s where he wants to go!
CLEO
What? But didn’t you say they burn
people there?
PEPE
Yes, but Paco says everyone there
is naked!
PEPE 
And that you can see all the
girls... naked!
CLEO
Don’t you know he’s leaving
tomorrow?
Wait there!
SOFI
Dad’s home early!
ANTONIO
There, there, there.... Let me get
out.
Who? Who? Who are these kids?
GELATINO
Ya se despertó tu rorro,
mamacita... 
DOÑA
My angel of the mornin’! Si a penas
son las dos de la tarde! Ya
descansanste de descansar? 
DOÑA 
Ora sí, mi cerecita de jaibol, el
edificio me dió toda su ropa a
lavar y voy a poder comprarte ese
reloj que tanto te gusta...!
GELATINO
No me gusta verte trabajar tanto,
mi cabecita blanca adorada! Así que
por favor vete al otro cuarto.
SOFÍA
Cleo?
CLEO
Yes, ma'am?
SOFÍA
Would you bring the doctor some
chamomile tea?
CLEO
Yes, ma'am.
Move over!
ADELA
Órale!
CLEO
Make some chamomile tea for the
señora and get going.
ADELA
Just don’t take too long...
SOFÍA
Can you take him?
Off to bed, children...
CLEO
Angelito de la Guarda, mi dulce
compañía, no me desampares ni de
noche ni de día. No me dejes sola
que me perdería... 
CLEO 
Night-night, beautiful Sofi...
And she gives her a kiss.
SOFI
Good night, Cleo.
ADELA
You took forever!
CLEO
Turn the light off already! Señora
Teresa gets angry if she sees the
light on!
ADELA
Ready?
CLEO
Go...
ADELA
One...
Two...
CLEO
...I won...
ADELA
(breathless)
...No...we’re...tied...
ADELA 
And then Moisés... remember Moisés,
from the village?
ADELA 
So he was there, boom, boom, boom,
and...
CLEO
Boom, boom...boom?
ADELA
No silly! Boom, boom, sending me
letter after letter...
CLEO
What all was he writing about?
ADELA
Well, that he couldn’t stop
thinking about me... about how much
he missed me... wanted to see me...
CLEO
Aaaaaaayyyyyyy...!
ADELA
That he felt so alone without me...
CLEO
Poor guy!
ADELA
That he couldn’t take not seeing me
no more...
CLEO
Aaaaaaay...
ADELA
And so my cousin, he comes over
from the village to run some
errands and brings me another
letter from Moisés...
CLEO
And?
ADELA
And so he pulls out the letter and
gives it to me... But the letter
was there with a bunch of other
letters, and as he’s pulling it
out, they all spill onto the floor.
And so I see one with Moisés’s
handwriting, and so I just take it
and I open it...!
ADELA 
And sure enough, it was Moisés’s. I
can’t stop thinking about you... I
want to see you.... I feel so alone
without you... I miss you so...
CLEO
Pobrecito! Such a nice guy!
ADELA
Sure. Except the letter was for
another girl!
CLEO
Noooooo!
ADELA
That bastard sends the same letter
to all the girls!
RAMÓN
Why so alone eating your
tortitassssss...?
ADELA

ADELA 
You want a torta?
FERMÍN

CLEO
Sure. I like movies, don’t you?
FERMÍN
Well, I mean... it’s so nice out
this afternoon, isn’t it?
CLEO
Yep, sure is clear.
You want to go to the Alameda?
FERMÍN
Wait a sec...
ADELA
So, manita, no movies for you?
CLEO
Well... it’s so nice out, no?
ADELA
Uuuuuuuuuuuuyyyyyy! Right... well,
you’ll tell me all about it later,
manita. I prefer the darkness.
FERMÍN
Jodan Tsuki!...
Jodan Tsuki! Chudan Tsuki! Mae
Geri!
What?
CLEO
So, do you train every day?
FERMÍN
I have to. I owe my life to martial
arts. I grew up with nothing, you
know?
When I was a kid and my ma died...
My aunt took me in... Over there in
Neza. And between my cousins who
beat me up and the bad influences,
I started drinking...and then
huffing...I was dying...
But then I found out about martial
arts. And so then those things...
well, you know, suddenly everything
seemed, well... focused?
I don’t really like telling people
about my stuff, but with you
it’s... different.
CLEO
Oh! Sorry...!
My little girl... my beautiful
little one...
Rise and shine... wake up, wake
up... it’s a new dawn, it’s a new

TOÑO
Get out!
SOFI
You can go in now!
TOÑO

CLEO
Come on, finish getting dressed.
SOFI
I want a Gansito too!
PACO
They’re mine.
TERESA
I bought them for everyone.
PACO
But I put them in the freezer.
TERESA
Come on, give one to Sofi and I’ll
buy you a big box just for you.
TERESA 
Hurry up kids, it’s seven twenty
already.
PACO
It’s seven seventeen!
For you to get fatter...
CLEO
Your juice, Toño.
TOÑO
Turn that thing off.
PACO
No, why?
TERESA
Let’s go!
Cleo, hold the dog so I can open
the door.

Haha! Sissy!
PACO

Move it!
SOFI
I’m moving!
TOÑO

PEPE
I was already up!
CLEO
Oh goody! So you’re already
dressed!
PEPE
Not yet.
CLEO
C’mon! Get up, let’s get you
dressed!
PEPE
You know what I remembered in my
dream?
CLEO
No, what did you remember?
PEPE
I remembered when I was older.
CLEO
When you were older?
PEPE
Yes, you were also there, but you
were different. Do you remember?
CLEO
Good night!
ADELA
Why didn’t you wake me?
CLEO
Well, God forbid you get tired
later.
PEPE 
Mom!
SOFÍA 
How’s your egg, my love?
CLEO
The Doctor is leaving. Tie Borras
up so he can go.
Your juice...
SOFÍA
Pepe can wait to say goodbye to his
dad. It doesn’t matter if he’s
late.
CLEO
Yes ma’m.
Leave them there, please, sir...!
ANTONIO
Thanks, Cleo.
ANTONIO 
Good morning, Pepón!
PEPE
Daddy!
ANTONIO
Well I’ll be...
SOFÍA
We’ll be here...
ANTONIO
It’s just for a few weeks...
Bye, Pepe...
SOFÍA
Goddamnit! Clean up that dog shit!
I’ll take Pepe.
FERMÍN
Suck it...
CLEO
It’s just that... I haven’t gotten
my period this month...
I’m telling you. I haven’t had my
period all month.
I think I‘m with child.
FERMÍN
Oooohhh, well that’s OK, right?
CLEO
That’s OK?
FERMÍN
Yeah...
Like that... Just. Like. That...
Yes, yeeeeees, yeeeeeeeees,

CLEO
Pardon me, Señora Sofi?
SOFÍA
Yes?
CLEO
It’s just that... when you have a
minute, would you mind if we talk
for a little bit?
SOFÍA
Yes, just wait a sec. I need to say
something to the children.
SOFÍA 
Feel free to sit down and wait over
here.
PACO
What?
TOÑO
I gotta go buy balsa wood to build
a model.
SOFÍA
You’ll go later. There’s something
I want to tell you...
PACO
Are we going to Disneyland?
SOFÍA
No, we’re spending Christmas at my
brother Pablo’s.
PACO
It’s so boring there!
SOFI
Not true! My cousins are there!
SOFÍA
And for New Year’s we’ll go to the
Zavaleta’s hacienda.
PACO
Will the Richards be there?
SOFÍA
Yes and the Matos and the Larsons.
TOÑO
When’s dad coming?
SOFÍA
That’s the other thing I wanted to
talk to you about. His research is
delayed and he’ll have to stay in
Quebec a little longer.
TOÑO
Will he be back by January?
SOFÍA
He doesn’t know. But that’s why I
brought you the paper. So you can
each write him a letter.
SOFÍA 
Tell him how much you miss him, to
come back soon please...
SOFÍA 
Pepe, you draw him somthing...
PEPE
I know how to write too.
PACO
Sure...
Toño gets up -
TOÑO
Well, first I’m going to go get my
balsa wood.
SOFÍA
You’re not going anywhere until
you’ve finished writing your
letter!
SOFÍA 
Where are you going?
TOÑO
To my room. What? Can’t I write the
letter in my room either?
SOFÍA
Sure, that’s fine.
PACO
I’m going up too.
SOFÍA
Sofi, take this to the dining room
and help Pepe with his letter. Let
me just talk to Cleo for a minute
and I’ll come join you.
SOFI
C’mon Pepe.
SOFÍA
Make lots of pretty drawings, Pepe.
Sofi, help him write “I miss you a
lot, daddy.”
SOFI
Sure. Let’s go Pepe.
PEPE
But I’ll write it, OK?
SOFÍA
OK, Cleo. What do you need?
SOFÍA 
Didn’t you want to tell me
something?
CLEO
No, well, yes. It’s just that...
SOFÍA
Yes?
What’s wrong, Cleo?
Is your mother all right?
CLEO
It’s just that... Señora Sofi...
SOFÍA
Yes?
CLEO
It’s just that... I think I’m
expecting.
SOFÍA
What do you mean, you think?
CLEO
It’s just that I haven’t gotten my
period.
SOFÍA
Since when?
CLEO
I don’t know...
SOFÍA
Oh you silly, silly girl. And who
is the dad?
CLEO
Fermín. Adela’s boyfriend’s cousin.
SOFÍA
Does he know?
CLEO
He’s disappeared.
SOFÍA
Silly, silly, silly...!
CLEO
You’re going to fire me, aren’t
you?
SOFÍA
What do you mean fire you? We have
to take you to the doctor to get
checked.
PEPE
Look, ma. I drew a plane.
SOFÍA
Very good. Now put some hearts on
it...
Sofi! I told you to help your
brother write “I miss you.”
SOFI
He won’t let me help him!
PEPE
Why is Cleo crying?
SOFÍA
For no reason. She’s got a
stomachache. Let’s see, come over
here. Let’s write your letter.
PEPE
Sana, sana colita de rana. Si no
sanas hoy, sanarás mañana...
SOFÍA
Pío, pío, pío, pío...
Pío, pío, pío, pío...
Good day, I have an appointment
with Doctor Vélez.
NURSE
Under what name?
SOFÍA
It’s Doctor Roldán’s wife.
Hello, Margarita. Thank you for
seeing us.
DOCTORA
Of course, Sofía. With pleasure.
They kiss hello.
SOFÍA
Remember Cleo?
DOCTORA
Of course! Hi Cleo, how are you?
CLEO
Fine, thank you, doctor.
DOCTORA
So, let’s see how you’re doing,
Cleo.
Come with me and tell me all about
it... Sofía, you want to come as
well?
SOFÍA
Thank you, Margarita. I’ll just go
over to say hi to Doctor Zavala.
DOCTORA
Well, Cleo and I are going to have
a chat. Why don’t we meet in the
lobby in forty minutes or so?
SOFÍA
Sure. I’ll be back then.
SOFÍA 
Go on Cleo, go with the doctor.
DOCTORA
All right then. Cleo, tell me.
CLEO
It’s just that.... That...
DOCTORA
It’s OK Cleo, you can talk to me...
CLEO
It’s that I haven’t gotten my
period.
DOCTORA
Since when?
CLEO
About two months maybe?
DOCTORA
OK. And you’ve been sexually active
for how long?
DOCTORA 
Have you had many partners?
CLEO
Oh no! Never!
DOCTORA
Do you use protection?
Do you use condoms?
When was the last time you got
checked?
CLEO
Probably three or four years ago
when I came to see you.
DOCTORA
That’s not good, Cleo. You have to
get checked twice a year.
CLEO
Yes, doctor.
DOCTORA
Well, let’s see how you’re doing.
This is going to feel a little
cold...
Hi, Mario...
DOCTOR
Doctoress...
SOFÍA
How’s Cleo doing?
DOCTORA
Cleo is ten weeks pregnant. She’s
very healthy and very strong and so
is her baby. One thing: she has to
get an iron shot every two weeks.
I’ve given her a prescription.
SOFÍA
When’s she due?
DOCTORA
Sometime around the end of June.
SOFÍA
Oh Margarita, thank you so much for
seeing her.
DOCTORA
It’s nothing! I missed her, right
Cleo? OK, I’m off...
DOCTORA 
Bye, Cleo. See you next month for
your check up.
CLEO
Yes, doctor. Thank you.
SOFÍA
Cleo, why don’t you go down to the
third floor to see the new-born
babies while I finish up here with
Doctor Zavala?
PEPE
Why does the mountain spell LEA?
SOFÍA
So that you kids read. See? Even
the mountain is asking.
TOÑO
It’s the initials for Luis
Echeverría Álvarez, dummy.
SOFÍA
Don’t call him that. He’s 5. He
doesn’t have to know who Echeverría
is. Explain it to him.
TOÑO
He’s the president!
SOFI
Isn’t it Gustavo Díaz Ordaz?
SOFÍA
Not anymore, Sofi. It’s now Luis
Echeverría, since December 1st.
SOFI
Oooooh...
PACO
Cleo really likes Echeverría. Yuck!
CLEO
Well, yeah. His wife Doña Ester is
always dressed in huipiles and
Oaxacan clothing. He likes us
Indians.
TOÑO
But my uncle Alberto says he’s the
one who ordered the students killed
two years ago.
CLEO
Noooooo!
TOÑO
He was the Minister of the
Interior.
SOFI
Why did he kill the students?
TOÑO
‘Cause they didn’t do their
homework.
SOFÍA
Enough, Toño. No, Sofi, Toño is
just messing with you.
PEPE
Well I don’t like him. Why does he
write on the mountain? It’s not
his!
MOLLY
Comadre!
BENITA
You sure you can carry that?
CLEO
Yes, I’m with child, not sick.
What? You tired already?
BENITA
As if!
CLEO
I haven’t seen you for six months
and you got old on me.
BENITA
Where you going?
You’ve gone too far. What? Since
you’re pregnant you forget
everything?
Señor José had the room
redecorated. They’re the Hacienda
dogs. Look... They were all in
storage.
Look, that there is Pirata. He
lived here in 1911.
CLEO
Pirata...
BENITA
And do you remember Canela?
CLEO
Yeah, where’s she at?
BENITA
Look at her.
CLEO
Yikes!
BENITA
She died during the summer.
CLEO
They say she must have eaten a
poisoned rat. But I think it was
the villagers who are bothering Don
José again about the land...
I saw you, Paco! Get out of here!
LUPE
Rodri! Don’t run in the water!
You’re soaking wet!
DR
Celso, do you still have bullets or
should I send Lupe to get the ones
in the chest?
SOFÍA
Don’t run over there, you could get
shot!
MOLLY
Boys! Vayase! Andy, get back!
CLEO
Wait, Pepe. Where are you going?
ALEJANDRO
What? Don’t ladies shoot?
MOLLY
Leslie is our representative!
ALEJANDRO
Leslie doesn’t count, she’s a
gringa.
CLAUDIA
Coming!
SAMANTHA
Yes, Claudia. You show them, girl!
ALEJANDRO
Leslie, could you help Claudia?
LESLIE
Come. Point the gun to the floor
when you’re not using it.
LESLIE 
C’mon, Lola. You really have to
wear a miniskirt and platform
shoes? We’re in the woods.
CLAUDIA
Forget her. You look great, Lola.
DR
Let’s see Lola, you want to shoot?
LOLA
Sure.
DR
Don’t close your eyes when you
shoot...
ALEJANDRO
Can you pour me a whisky with two
ice cubes?
RICARDO
Be careful Pepe, your wife is like
a guerrilla fighter!
SAMANTHA
Come on, comadre!
RICARDO
Co-ra-zón de melón, de melón melón!
Corazón!
BENITA
Come her for a sec.
Just come over for a sec.
CLEO
But... what if?
BENITA
What? Is a kid going to cry because
he lost at marbles or his brother
stepped on him?
RICARDO
Co-ra-zón de me-lón, de me-lón, melón, co-ra-zón!
GLORIA
What? They finally let you out?
BENITA
What’ll you have?
CLEO
Nothing, thank you.
BENITA
What? You’re not going to toast the
New Year with us? What, you only
speak English now?
CLEO
It’s just that... the baby...
BENITA
A drink on New Year’s will do it
good. Celebrate while you can. See
that guy with the hat?
They killed his son in August. The
villagers did. Because of a land
dispute.
Cleo looks at him, moved.
BENITA 
You got life?
CLEO
Sure...
BENITA
I mean liquor.
CLEO
I’d rather just have a little
pulque.
BENITA
That’s the spirit!
Here’s to a beautiful 1971 and to
your baby’s health!
CLEO
Cheers!
BENITA
Cheers!
GLORIA
Sorry, manita!
BENITA
No sweat. You dance, we got plenty
more where that came from!
SOFÍA
What are you doing?
ALEJANDRO
Come, now... You know you want
to...
SOFÍA
No, Alex! Leave me alone! You’re
drunk!
ALEJANDRO
Fine. Fine! I just wanted to
comfort you, but...
It’s not even like you’re that hot,
comadre...
OVE

Happy NEW YEAR!
Happy New year!

BENITA
Don’t run too far. We’ll just reach
to the outskirts and come back!
PACO
What skirts?
BENITA
The hillside.
PACO
You mean the hill has skirts?
BENITA
The outskirts... well, the slopes
then!
PACO
Alex, the hill has a skirt!
PACO 
If we lean over we’ll be able to
see its panties.
CLAUDIA
What are you guys doing?
PACO
Looking up the hill’s skirts to see
its panties.
LOLA
Hills don’t have underwear.
PACO
And neither do you!
LOLA
Asshole!
PACO
Ooooooh!
GLORIA
Alex! Paco! Leave the girls alone!
CLEO
It’s like my village. Without the
mountain, of course, but it looks
just like this...
This is how it sounds...
Just like this...
This is how it smells...
PACO
Look, they fixed it all up. Just
like new, right?
TOÑO
The Cowboys won only because
Baltimore was overconfident.
BETO
What are you talking about? We
scored three touchdowns in the
second half. One after the other!
TOÑO
I’m telling you. Baltimore was
overconfident. How can you root for
the Cowboys?
SOFI
I like the Cowboy’s cheerleaders.
In my school...
PACO
Who cares about cheerleaders?
TOÑO
Ma? Can Beto and I go to the
movies?
SOFÍA
What are you going to see?
TOÑO
The Red Tent, at The Americas
theater.
PACO
I want to go too!
TOÑO
No, just Beto and me.
PACO
How come?
TOÑO
Get yourself your own friends!
SOFI
I want to go to the movies too!
TOÑO
I said no! It’s just me and Beto.
SOFÍA
Either everyone goes or no one
goes!
TOÑO
They can go to a different movie!
PACO
I want to go to Las Americas!
TOÑO
You don’t even know what The Red
Tent is!
SOFÍA
I said, either everyone goes or no
one goes!
TOÑO
It’s not fair!
SOFÍA
If you don’t like it you can go
live somewhere else!
PEPE
Is it a cartoon?
SOFÍA
Hello? Oh, yes, hold on a minute...
She calls to the breakfast room -
SOFÍA 
Cleo! I’m going to get this
upstairs, would you mind hanging up
here!
There...!
MOLLY
How are you feeling, comadre?
TERESA
We’re late! You coming down or
what?
PACO
Let them stay. Let’s go...
TERESA
We’re leaving!
TOÑO
What are you waiting for?
PACO
...Braniff planes may be different
colors but they’re all 727s...
TOÑO
See you at the movies!
TERESA
Toño!
MAN
It’s Zovek.
CLEO
No...! Zovek?
MAN
Look at ‘im...
CLEO
Is that really professor Zovek?
MAN
He’s done over a hundred push ups
by now!
CLEO
What? Does he always come here?
MAN
No, not always, but sometimes he
comes to train them.
PROFESSOR
You too can be a Kombateka! Every
human being holds great potential
he must develop through physical
conditioning and through mental and
spiritual evolution.
You too can develop your potential.
But don’t expect any miracles, the
only miracle lies in your own will.
This is why mental development is
the true motor of physical
development.
And next up... an act!
This is a routine that requires
absolute physical condition! Only
martial arts masters and a few
great athletes can master it!
Yes... You... please bandage my
eyes.
Make sure they’re totally covered.
You’ve got plenty of bandage there.
Thank you, you may return to your
place.
And now...!
Huuuuuuuh!
Are you disappointed? Were you
expecting me to lift a jet or an
elephant?
You are witnessing an incredible
feat! You don’t believe me? Try it.
Just close your eyes and lift up a
foot.
CLEO
Fermín!
FERMÍN
What’s up my Cleo?
CLEO
Can you talk for a minute?
FERMÍN
Long time no see, Cleo!
CLEO
Hi, Fermín...
FERMÍN
What are you doing around these
parts?
CLEO
Well, I have left you so many
messages and I’ve been looking for
you but I can never find you so...
FERMÍN
I’m sorry my Cleo, but the training
got real hard core and they even
brought in a gringo trainer and
another one from Korea. Well, the
American had been here already, but
the Korean one is new.
CLEO
Is it for the Olympics?
FERMÍN
Something like that. Who told you I
was here?
CLEO
It’s just that a neighbor’s brother
in law trains with you so...
FERMÍN
It was Ramón, right?
CLEO
No, no, no!
FERMÍN
Son of a... Fucking Ramón. I’ll get
him when I see him -
Jodan Tsuki!... Chudan Tsuki!...
Mae Geri!...
CLEO
It’s just that... I’m with child...
FERMÍN
What’s it to me?
CLEO
Well, the little one’s yours.
FERMÍN
No fucking way!
CLEO
But it is, Fermín!
FERMÍN
I told you already, there’s no
fucking way! So if you don’t want
me to fuck you up real bad, you and
your “little one” too, don’t ever
fucking say it again and don’t ever
come looking for me again!
Fucking cunt!
MAN
...20.
CLEO
Borras!
SOFÍA 
...he wrote them letters from socalled Vancouver...
...he doesn’t even have enough of a
pair to tell the children...
CLEO
G-e-t o-u-t- o-f h-e-r-e
SOFÍA
And you? What are you spying on?...
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Paco! Why
were you eavesdropping? Why were
you eavesdropping?
And you! Why did you let him?
Don’t say anything to your brothers
and sisters. Don’t say a thing.
Promise me... Promise...
SOFI
It has so many drawings. Look, I
think this little girl is me and I
think this is my daddy...
And this is a heart, look, with an
S for Sofi and a P for Papa... and
this here is a dog... or is it a
fish?
CLEO
Maybe it’s a dolphin, I think?
SOFI
A dolphin? No. It’s like a
doggie...
PEPE
It’s a seal! In the fourth letter
my dad sent Paco, he said he can
see the ocean from his hotel room
and that there are a lot of seals.
SOFI
Yes. It’s a seal! Like the ones in
his hotel!
PEPE
You had said dolphin. It looks
nothing like a dolphin!
CLEO
No?
SOFI
No!
CLEO
So it’s not a dolphin? What do you
think it is?
SOFI
A seal!
PEPE
A seal!
CLEO
What you looking at?
PEPE
When’s your baby coming out?
CLEO
Next month.
SOFI
It is a girl?
CLEO
I don’t know...
SOFI
Oh, please let it be a girl!
Pleeeease! What’s her name?
CLEO
I don’t know.
SOFI
If it’s a girl can her name be
Tabitha like Bewitched?
CLEO
Maybe...
PEPE
And will she live here?
SOFI
If she’s a girl yes!
CLEO
I don’t know. Would you like her to
live here?
PEPE
No way! Yuck!
CLEO
Let’s see! Put your pajamas on!
TERESA 
Children! Stop it, Toño! Stop!
SOFI
Cleo! Toño and Paco are fighting!
TERESA
Stop it! Now!
CLEO
Boys!
TERESA
Toño!
CLEO
Boys! I’m going to tell your mom
when she comes back!
TERESA
Paco!
What are you doing! Paco!
PACO
He hit me first!
TOÑO
Because you pushed me!
TERESA
How could you throw that thing!?
You could have killed your brother!
You could have killed him!
ADELA
You head up, manita, I’ll finish up
here...
I’ll go.
SOFÍA
We’re alone. Always. Even though
they say we aren’t.
IGNACIO
Maybe if we park over here, far
away, because there’s a student
protest.
TERESA
I hope they don’t get them again...
You like that one?
CLEO
It’s so beautiful.
TERESA
What’s your best price on this
crib.
With my faithful old time customer
discount, eh?
SALESWOMAN
Let me ask the manager.
CLEO
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhggggg!
IGNACIO
Wait for me here. Just a sec.
IGNACIO 
Excuse me...
NURSE
Line is over there...
CLEO
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhaa!
IGNACIO
Doctor Vélez! Doctor Vélez!
Doctor Vélez! Doctor Vélez!
DOCTORA
Here, here, here....
Nurse! Nurse!
DOCTORA
Hi, Cleo. How are you feeling?
I’ll take it from here. You can
wait out there.
ANTONIO
Hi Cleo, how are you feeling?
CLEO
Doctor...!
ANTONIO
You’re in good hands... How many
babies have you delivered, Doctor
Vélez?
DOCTORA
Hundreds!
CLEO
Aaaahhhhggg!
ANTONIO
Breathe Cleo... Like this...
Doctor Vélez will only let me come
up to this point....
DOCTORA
Don’t mind me. Come in if you like.
ANTONIO
No, uh... I have a patient...
You’re going to be just fine,
Cleo...
DOCTORA
Take off all your clothes and put
on this gown, OK?
When did you last menstruate?
CLEO
September?
DOCTORA
Do you have a due date?
CLEO
June 21st...
DOCTORA
Were there any complications during
the pregnancy?
How long ago did your water break?
CLEO
About an hour and a half ago. We
couldn’t get out of where we were
and...
DOCTORA
Was it clear?
CLEO
Huh?
DOCTORA
The water. Was it transparent?
CLEO
No. A little thick. Like soup.
DOCTORA
Don’t push Cleo, blow. Help her get
on the bed...
Check dilation.
RESIDENT
Seven or eight centimeters...
DOCTORA
Frequency?
RESIDENT
I can’t hear the foetal focus...
NURSE
Blow, ma’am!
RESIDENT
She’s full. She’s in second
plane... expulsive with full
dilation and there is four cross
meconium and asystole.
DOCTORA
Plug in mixed solution at 5% and
wheel her into Labor immediately.
Alert pediatrics. Prepare a
laryngoscope, reanimation equipment
and an ambu.
RESIDENT
Can you climb onto the gurney for
me?
DOCTORA
Let’s get your baby out.
CLEO
Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!
DOCTORA
Don’t blow, Cleo. Push!
Almost there... Push!
CLEO
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
PEDIATRICIAN
No heart beat. We’ll try
reanimation.
Still asystole...
Ma'am. I am afraid you’re baby is
stillborn. She had no amniotic
liquid. And the green liquid
blocked her lungs. I am so sorry,
señora.
DOCTORA
I am so sorry, Cleo...
PEDIATRICIAN
Would you like to say good bye to
your baby, ma'am?
Who are you with? Can we call
someone?
DOCTORA
She’s with family. They’re outside.
Did you say something, Cleo. I
couldn’t hear you...
CLEO
Señora Sofía... Señora Sofía...
DOCTORA
Yes, Cleo, I will give her a
call...
NURSE
May I? Ma'am?
ADELA 
Move it!
It’s the sharpener! Move it! Cleo!
PACO
Toño! Sofi! Come!
PEPE
Mom bought a new car!
SOFÍA
You like it?
PACO
How fast can it go?
SOFÍA
You check.
TOÑO
Why not a Maverick?
PACO
It only goes to 145! The Galaxie
goes up to 200!
SOFÍA
Because they’re very expensive and
I want a small car. I’ve had it up
to here with that Galaxie!
SOFI
I like the new car, mommy.
PACO
What about the Galaxie?
SOFÍA
I sold it. They’re coming to pick
it up next week.
SOFI
Does dad know?
SOFÍA
No, it’s a surprise.
SOFÍA 
Hi, Cleo. Do you like the new car?
SOFÍA 
And speaking of surprises, we’re
going on a trip this weekend and
we’re taking the Galaxie on its
goodbye ride.
SOFI
Where to?
SOFÍA
Tuxpan.
PACO
Where’s Tuxpan?
TOÑO
I have practice!
SOFÍA
You’ll skip it. Tuxpan is in
Veracruz.
PACO
It’s the beach?
SOFÍA
Yes.
TOÑO
The beach in Veracruz is so ugly.
TOÑO 
La Pantera doesn’t get all the way
here.
PACO 
I heard it for a little bit.
SOFÍA 
Look! The sea!
PACO
Stop, stop, stop! Ma!
SOFÍA
Why don’t we go drop the bags off
at the hotel first?
TOÑO
By the time we get there it’ll be
dark.
PACO
Let’s go! Just for a little while.
SOFÍA
OK. Only for a little bit though.
PEPE
Cat got your tongue?
Then why don’t you talk.
PACO
Ay! Ay ! Ay...!
SOFÍA
I told you to put on your T-shirt.
PACO
But it was cloudy!
SOFÍA
That’s why! The glare is worse than
the sun!
SOFÍA 
Are you dressed Pepe?
PEPE
Yes, but the cat got Cleo’s tongue.
SOFÍA
Children?
Children?
Pay attention! I have something to
tell you.
Your dad’s not in Ottawa.
SOFI
Is he back?!
SOFÍA
No. Your dad never went anywhere.
Well, yes. But he only went for a
week and... your father’s not
coming back home.
We came on this trip so he could
come get his things from the house.
PACO
What things?
SOFÍA
His things. Or what he says are his
things. His clothes, the
bookshelves...
PACO
Are you getting a divorce?
SOFÍA
He says he doesn’t know.
SOFI
He doesn’t love us anymore?
SOFÍA
Dad loves you very much. He says he
wants to see you.
TOÑO
When?
SOFÍA
He says he doesn’t know when...
Soon.
There will be many changes, but
we’ll be together and it’ll be an
adventure.
I’m starting a new full time job in
publishing next week.
TOÑO
Publishing? But you’re a chemist.
SOFÍA
I know, but your father hasn’t sent
any money yet and teaching high
school is not enough. Plus, I love
books and I never liked chemistry.
It’ll be another adventure.
PACO
Are you going to come in?
SOFÍA
I have to go check on the tires
since we’re leaving tomorrow early.
You coming?
PACO
No. It’s our last day at the beach.
SOFI
I’m staying too.
SOFÍA
But if I leave, you can’t go in. If
something happens, Cleo can’t swim.
PACO
But it’s so mellow.
SOFÍA
I don’t care. If you want to stay,
those are the rules.
PACO
Not even by the edge?
SOFÍA
By the edge is fine. But just here,
understood?
PACO
Yes...
SOFI
Yes...
PEPE
Me too?
SOFÍA
Yes, but right by the shore.
SOFÍA 
Can I leave them with you? I won’t
take long.
CLEO
Just right by the shore.
PEPE
Aaaah!
CLEO
Paco! Just in the shallow water!
Sofi!
PEPE
Carry me.
CLEO
No way. You can do it alone. It’s
not hot anymore.
Paco! I see you! Back to the shore!
PACO 
But we’re at the shore!
CLEO
Come closer! You heard your mother,
if you don’t come in, you have to
get out!
Suit yourself. You’re just getting
more sand on you and I was going to
clean you up in the palapa.
Hey! I’m watching you guys!
PEPE
Did you know when I was grown up I
was a sailor?
CLEO
Mmmhmmm...
PEPE
Yes, and I drowned in a storm.
CLEO
Mmmhmmm...
CLEO 
Paco and Sofi! Closer!
PEPE
But the waves were so big....
CLEO
Get back!
Closer!
PEPE
And it was night and there was so
much lightning... and I didn’t know
how to swim...
CLEO
Stay there Pepe.
Help your sister!
Pepe! I told you to stay there!
SOFÍA
Are you OK, my love?
SOFI
Cleo saved us...
SOFÍA
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Cleo...
CLEO
I didn’t want her... I didn’t want
her...
SOFÍA
Shhh, shhh, shhh... They’re OK. The
kids are OK....
CLEO
I didn’t want her... I didn’t want
her to be born...
Poor little girl! ... I didn’t want
her to be born! ... I didn’t want
her to be born!...
SOFÍA
It’s going to be all right, Cleo...
It’s going to be all right...
CLEO
Tie the dog ...
SOFÍA
You too, kids. Don’t play dumb and
come help us with the things.
TOÑO
It’s horrible. It’s horrible
without the bookshelves...
PACO
I like it better this way...
Toño runs up the stairs...
TOÑO
It’s awful.
SOFI
What’s so horrible mommy?
SOFÍA
He doesn’t like the hallway without
the bookshelves.
SOFI
What bookshelves?
SOFÍA
The ones that used to be in the
hall.
SOFI
Oh! You’re right!
PEPE
Wow! It looks bigger!
SOFÍA
What did you think about our
adventure?
SOFI
I liked it a lot.
ADELA
I’m going to the store, there’s no
ham. How was it then?
CLEO
Real pretty. Go. I’ll tell you
about it later.
PEPE 
The desk is gone too!
SOFÍA
And we’ll have other adventures.
And we’ll travel a lot.
PACO
We’ll go to Dinseyland?
SOFÍA
We don’t have enough money...
But we can go on adventures in the
car. What if we went to a ghost
mining town in the desert?
PEPE
And there’s ghosts?
PACO
No, silly. That’s what you call
towns that are abandoned. And
what’s over there?
SOFÍA
Nothing. Just the town and the
abandoned mine. Or we could go to
the Lacandon jungle, or Oaxaca...
SOFI
Oaxaca, Yes! And we could visit
Cleo’s village.
PACO
I was there.
SOFI
Finders keepers...
CLEO
Hello? Yes, thank you ma’am... Yes
just a moment...
Señora Sofi? It’s señora Molly
calling.
SOFÍA
Don’t fight. You sit here, Paco.
Hello, comadre. How are you? I’m
just back from Tuxpan...
PEPE
Cleo? Can you bring me a banana
milkshake?
SOFI
Me too?
CLEO
Sure. Just lemme take these clothes
up to wash. Do you want something,
Paco?
PACO
Any Gansitos?
CLEO
I’m not sure, but if not, I’ll go
get some later.
SOFÍA
Yes, it was wonderful... Yes, the
kids are all right... No... lovely!
.... good...
Well Paco and Sofi scared the
living daylights out of me...
