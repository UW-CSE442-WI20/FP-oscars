MICHAEL 
There are many stories about Michael
Sullivan. Some say he was a decent
man. Some say there was no good in
him at all. But I once spent six
weeks on the road with him in the
winter of 1931.
FADE TO WHITE:
MICHAEL  
This is our story.
EXT. INDUSTRIAL AREA - ROCK ISLAND, ILL - DAY
A dark spec emerges over the crest of a hill from endless
white snow: MICHAEL SULLIVAN, 12, biking towards us with a
satchel of newspapers over his shoulder.
His face is wrapped in a long woolen scarf.
He speeds along, dwarfed by a vast stretch of CLOSED
FACTORIES.
Smoke billows from a pair of smoke stacks. WORKERS pour out
the gated entrance.
EXT. ENTRANCE - JOHN DEERE PLANT - DAY
Michael stands in the tide of workers, holding up his papers.
MICHAEL
Thank you, sir. Much obliged to you.
Man dies in factory accident! Get
your paper here!
Various workers dig in pockets for change.
MICHAEL 
Hot off the press, only five cents!
Michael rides his bike through a throng of walking workers.
EXT. INDUSTRIAL AREA - DAY
Michael rides past another huge factory.
EXT. MAIN STREET - ROCK ISLAND- DAY
Michael cycles down main street. Cars drive in both
directions. He cycles down the center of the road. The cars
narrowly miss him on either side.
He cycles past some BOARDED UP SHOPS, stopping outside:
INT. DRUG STORE - DAY
Michael parks his bike. Enters. He drops his NEWSPAPER BAG
on the counter. The OWNER counts the papers as Michael
unwraps his scarf.
Now we see his FACE for the first time. Innocent.
Inquisitive.
Michael pays for the papers he’s sold. As for the owner
rings up the transaction, Michael takes a pouch of BUGLER
TOBACCO from the counter. While Michael receives his
commission change with one hand, the other hand slips the
tobacco into the waistband of his trousers.
MICHAEL
Thanks, Mister Miller
Michael walks out onto the street.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
Michael is cycling along, one hand to steer the bike, the
other to puff on his lit PIPE.
EXT. ST. PETER’S CHURCH - DAY
Michael passes by a CATHOLIC CHURCH.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DAY
Michael coasts onto a long, tree-lined driveway leading up to
a large HOUSE. To the side is a detached GARAGE. Woods
beyond.
Michael senses danger... Suddenly, a FIGURE lunges out from
behind a tree and throws a snowball. It is his brother,
PETER, 10. Michael is hit and FALLS off his bike
spectacularly, the pipe flying from his mouth.
2.

He picks up a snowball and fires one back at PETER who falls
backwards, stunned, as if shot in the forehead.
Peter rolls on the ground until he is still.
MICHAEL and PETER lie a few yards apart. ‘Dead’. Their
breath smoking in the air.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DAY
CLOSE: Reflection in glass window of the boys in the snow.
A woman’s face looks out and smiles.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
From inside the house their mother, ANNIE SULLIVAN, 40’s,
watches Michael and Peter lying in the snow. Sound of a
distant car approaching.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DAY
Michael and Peter leap to their feet dusting off the snow on
their clothes. A CAR appears in the driveway. They stand,
almost to attention, as the car approaches.
Michael buries his pipe in the snow with his foot.
The car drives past them. PETER CHASES the car to the GARAGE.
Michael watches.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING (LATER)
Michael and Peter are doing their HOMEWORK at the table.
Annie is cooking. Michael looks down to his work: Math. A
BLANK page. He glances at Peter who writes fluently in his
school book. Annie senses her eldest son struggling with his
homework. It’s not an unusual occurrence. She moves over to
him, bends down, whispering in his ear conspiratorially:
ANNIE
I’ll help you with it later....
Michael smiles. She kisses his cheek.
ANNIE 
You go fetch your father.
3.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - LANDING - EARLY EVENING
Michael comes up the stairs onto the landing. At the end of
the CORRIDOR is the half-open door to his parents’ bedroom
through which he glimpses his father, SULLIVAN.
We don’t see his face.
ON MICHAEL: watching in silence, cautious yet fascinated by
the mysteries of a father’s ritual:
CLOSE: Sullivan removes his tie and gracefully lays it on the
bed... Next to it, he lays some keys and rosary beads... He
removes a holstered Colt 45 and places it next to them.
MICHAEL
Pa?
Sullivan senses his son. He removes his jacket and places it
over the gun.
SULLIVAN
Mm-hm.
MICHAEL
Dinner’s ready.
SULLIVAN
Thank you.
Michael walks back down the corridor.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING
A formal scene: family at table. Boys silent and scrubbed.
MICHAEL
(praying)
Bless us oh Lord for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive through
the bounty of Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
ALL
Amen.
They make the sign of the cross and begin to eat.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DAY (NEXT DAY)
Sullivan sits in the driver’s seat of the CAR seen before.
Engine is running. Michael gets in the back.
4.

Both Sullivan and Michael are formally dressed. Sullivan
looks at his son via the rear view MIRROR.
SULLIVAN
Michael.
MICHAEL
Sir?
SULLIVAN
It’s a wake. So I don’t wanna see
those dice.
MICHAEL
No, sir.
Sullivan observes him in the mirror, unsure whether he’s
lying. Michael looks out the window.
EXT. ROONEY’S ESTATE - DAY
The CAR pulls into the circular drive of a sprawling
VICTORIAN ESTATE. Sullivan and his family get out. Various
PEOPLE, some of them poor, but all of them wearing their best
clothes, head into the MANSION.
INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - HALL - DAY
Sullivan opens the door, letting them into a dark, lavish
hall. MOURNERS, laughing and chattering. Old women, working
men, scruffy children; the people contrasting with the ornate
interior. Sullivan removes his hat and steers his family
through the throng into -
INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - ANTE ROOM - DAY
A quiet room.
Annie, Sullivan and the boys enter. Sullivan and Michael head
O.S. to the coffin to pray their respects...
As Annie follows, Peter hangs back, not wanting to go.
PETER
(whispering)
I don’t want to go.
ANNIE
It’s all right, honey. Come on.
PETER
No. I’m scared.
5.


Annie understands and relents, staying back.
Sullivan and Michael approach. In front of a fire, an OPEN
COFFIN rests on a bed of ICE. Buckets catch the drips.
Sullivan notices Michael’s curiosity.
SULLIVAN
Ice helps preserve the body.
Sullivan and Michael kneel and pray. After a few seconds
Michael peeks over the edge at the DEAD MAN; the skin, waxy
and pale. Pennies on his eyes. Fascinating. Michael
glances at Sullivan. His eyes are closed in prayer.
Sullivan makes the sign of the cross. Michael follows his
lead.
Sullivan rises, with Michael and turns to find ROONEY leaning
against the door, smiling. He is a man of 70’s, handome.
ROONEY
Who’s got a hug for a lonely old man?
Michael and Peter rush to him, delighted. He scoops them up
in turn.
ROONEY 
Now which is which? Don’t help me!
(indicating to Michael)
Peter.
(indicating to Peter)
And... Michael.
The boys groan at his usual ‘mistake on purpose’. Sullivan
smiles.
ROONEY 
Annie. Mike. Good to see you.
ROONEY 
(whispering to Michael)
Did you bring the necessary?
Michael nods, surreptitiously.
PETER
(excited whisper)
Yes.
6.


ROONEY
(to Sullivan)
If you’ll excuse me, I have some
urgent business with these young
gentleman.
He leads the boys away, one on each arm. Sullivan watches
them depart, quietly amused.
INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - BASEMENT - EVENING
CLOSE: Two DICE roll up against a white-tiled wall.
Michael and Peter leap excitedly into the air.
MICHAEL
Yeah!
PETER
(overlapping)
Winner! Winner!
ROONEY sits on a crate. Mock devastated. Mops his brow with
his handkerchief.
ROONEY
Call the cops. I know hustlers when I
see ‘em.
MICHAEL
No hustle ol’ timer!
PETER
Pay the man!
Paternally, Rooney pulls Michael in, slides his arm around
him.
ROONEY
Upstairs. Jacket pocket in my study.
Before I change my mind
INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - STAIRS - NIGHT
Michael runs up the stairs.
INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Michael looks for Rooney’s STUDY.
He finds it at the end of the corridor. He pushes the door
open.
7.

INT. ROONEY’S STUDY - NIGHT
Inside, the curtains are drawn.
CONNOR ROONEY, late 30’s, handsome, lies on a couch, smoking.
A glass of WHISKY beside him.
As Michael enters, Connor is looking straight at him.
CONNOR
Hello.
MICHAEL
Hello...
CONNOR
(not unfriendly)
Remind me, which little Sullivan are
you?
MICHAEL
Michael, Sir.
CONNOR
Sir? You don’t have to call me sir.
I’m not your Pa.
MICHAEL
No, Mr. Rooney
CONNOR
Call me Connor. No, call me Uncle
Connor.
CONNOR turns away from him. MICHAEL looks at Rooney’s JACKET
on the back of the desk chair. Considers going to it, but is
too scared.
CONNOR 
What do you want?
MICHAEL
Mister Rooney sent me to get his
jacket.
CONNOR
Why don’t you come back later, huh?
I’m busy.
MICHAEL
Yes... Sir.
8.

Michael leaves, closing the door behind him.
INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - GRAND PARLOR - NIGHT (LATER)
CLOSE: A glass A spoon taps it.
The room goes quiet. Rooney takes the stage. Takes his had
written speech out.
ROONEY
Hello! Hello! I want to welcome all
of you to my home. It’s good to have
so many friends in this house again.
Since Mary died, it’s - well - it’s
just been me and my boy, rattling
around in these rooms...
He unfolds his written speech, decides against it.
ROONEY 
I had this speech prepared, but it
would be dishonest of me to say that I
knew Danny well. But lose one of us,
it hurts us all.
(murmurs of approval)
I’ll tell you what I do remember
though. And Finn will remember this
too. And that’s... Danny on the high
school football team. A championship
game: down six points, ten seconds
left to play, four yards to go. Danny
tackles his own quarterback.

Mistakes. You know, we all make’em
God knows.
Rooney looks to FINN MCGOVERN, who doesn’t respond.
ROONEY 
Let’s drink to Danny’s honor. Let’s
wake him to God.
All around the room the whiskey bottles come out. Rooney
holds up his whiskey bottle.
ROONEY 
And hope he gets to heaven at least an
hour before the Devil finds out he’s
dead.
The quote captures Michael’s attention as the room drinks and
cries “Amen”.
9.


ROONEY 
To Danny!
MOURNERS
(in unison)
To Danny!
ROONEY
And now, our good friend, Finn
McGovern, will say a few words.
Words, I’ll wager, that have a little
more poetry than mine.
Applause. McGOVERN takes the stage, Rooney hugs him.
MCGOVERN
Thank you, John. My brother Danny
wasn’t wise, nor was he gentle. And
with a skinfull of liquor in him... he
was a pain in the ass.
Gentle laughter from the crowd.
MCGOVERN 
Bute he was loyal. And brave. And he
never told a lie.
CLOSE: Sullivan watching McGovern closely.
MCGOVERN 
He’d’ve enjoyed this party. Me and
the family, we want to say thank you
to our generous host. Where would
this town be without Mr. John Rooney.
God love you.
Big murdered approval. Rooney bows his head, humbly.
MCGOVERN 
(looking at Rooney)
I’ve worked for you many years now
John, nearly half my life... and we’ve
never had a disagreement... but...
CLOSE: Rooney watching. Steely.
CLOSE: Sullivan, ready to take action.
10.


MCGOVERN 
(emotional)
I’ve come to realize that you rule
this town as God rules the earth...
you give and take away.
Swiftly, a seemingly friendly Sullivan moves up onto the
makeshift stage and firmly, but gently grabs hold of Finn’s
arm and leads him to the door.
Rooney glances to the band to strike up some music.
CLOSE: Michael watching.
Two of Finn’s friends follow them out.
CLOSE: Connor watches, then follows them out as well.
EXT. ROONEY’S MANSION - NIGHT
McGovern’s men walk ahead - one getting behind the wheel, one
opening the car door - as we remain on McGovern leaning on
Sullivan who helps him walk to the car.
Connor catches up to the other side of McGovern to help, but
McGovern swipes him away, drunk.
MCGOVERN
I’m going to bury my brother, then I’m
going to deal with you.
Sullivan brushes off the drunken rave.
SULLIVAN
Sure, Finn, sure. You’ll take care of
all of us once you get a good night’s
sleep.
Sullivan and McGovern continue, exiting off camera as we stay
on Connor, for who this was not a drunken remark - but a
direct threat.
McGOVERN is helped into a TRUCK by Sullivan and McGovern’s
two friends. The TRUCK pulls away.
Sullivan returns to Connor’s side as the truck disappears
down the driveway and Rooney approaches them.
ROONEY
Is he all right?
11.


CONNOR
(casually)
Yeah, he’s fine. Just too much to
drink. I’ll talk to him.
ROONEY
Take Mike with you.
CONNOR
No, Pa - I’ll be fine.
ROONEY
Take Mike with you... And just talk.
Nothing more.
Rooney walks back to the house
MICHAEL is watching the three of them from the front doorway.
Sullivan sees Michael watching - wondering what he heard or
understood. Their eyes meet.
INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - GRAND PARLOR - NIGHT
It is later. The musicians are playing a REEL.
The majority of the crowd are drunk and dancing.
Amongst the crowd, we see the following:
A YOUNG GIRL invites MICHAEL to dance. He stands up, but
shakes his head, declining.
ROONEY , shuffling charmingly across the room in time to the
music. A glass of whisky in each hand.
ANNIE is dancing with SEAN, (one of Rooney’s men). She whirls
around, hair flying. SULLIVAN sits to the side, watching
her.
Connor is dancing with a young girl. He is very good -
slick, smooth. On-lookers cheer him on.
The music finishes. Connor ends with a deftly executed dip.
Everyone applauds.
The sound of a piano. The opening cords of an IRISH AIR.
“Aaahs” from the Crowd.
CUT TO:
12.


Rooney sits at the piano, playing. The room slowly goes
quiet. He catches Sullivan’s eye amongst the crowd, gestures
him over with his head.
Sullivan joins him on the piano stool. Begins to play along
with him, hesitant at first, then gradually getting into the
flow. A memory of childhood.
CLOSE: Connor watches his father and Sullivan through the
crowd. He is smiling, though his eyes aren’t.
CLOSE: Annie smiles slightly.
CLOSE: Rooney and Sullivan’s hands move in concert, two hard
men seamlessly producing a delicate, melancholy tune.
The crowd applauds. Sullivan and Rooney nod at each other,
an unspoken bond.
Connor watches, jealous. Still grinning. He feels a
presence, and looks down to see PETER.
PETER
Why are you always smiling?
Connor stare at him.
CONNOR
‘Cause it’s all so fuckin’ hysterical.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - BOYS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT
Michael sits in bed and uses a FLASHLIGHT to illuminate his
reading.
He quietly turns the page of his LONE RANGER COMIC BOOK.
[N.B. These books have text on the left hand page, and a
single, captioned cartoon on the right hand page] .
We see the page Michael reads:
Plate 1: “Moonlight streamed into the room.”
Suddenly, from his bed across the room, Peter whispers
PETER
Michael?
MICHAEL
What?
13.


PETER
I had a nightmare. It was about Mr.
Rooney’s house.
MICHAEL
It’s just a house. A big house. Go
back to sleep.
PETER
Is Mr. Rooney rich like the Babe?
MICHAEL
Richer.
PETER
(a beat)
Are we rich?
MICHAEL
No stupid.
A long silence. Michael turns a page.
Plate 2: “A man climbed in at the window.”
PETER
What’s Papa’s job?
MICHAEL
He works for Mr. Rooney.
PETER
Why?
MICHAEL
Well, Papa didn’t have a father. So,
Mr. Rooney looked after him.
PETER
I know that. But what’s his job?
Michael goes very still. He doesn’t know, but can’t admit
it.
He tries to escape back in the LONE RANGER.
MICHAEL
(staring at the page)
He goes on missions for Mr. Rooney...
they’re very dangerous, that’s why he
brings his gun...
14.


Michael turns a page in the comic book.
Plate 3: “He had the Sheriff covered.”
MICHAEL 
Sometimes even the President sends him
on missions...because Papa was a war
hero and all.
Peter considers. Sober. Pronounces:
PETER
You’re just making that up.
MICHAEL
I am not!
Pause. Peter sighs. Turns over in bed.
PETER
It’s all so fuckin’ hysterical.
CLOSE ON MICHAEL: Genuinely shocked.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Sullivan family at breakfast. Sullivan is finishing his
coffee, and putting on his jacket.
SULLIVAN
Peter, I can’t come to your concert
tonight. I’m working.
Michael and Peter look up.
PETER
(eyes flicking to Michael:
curious)
Working at what?
ANNIE
(swiftly)
Putting food on your plate, young man.
Michael continues eating, feigning disinterest.
SULLIVAN
All right, boys. Come on. Clear the
plates.
Peter picks up his plates and carries them toward the sink,
then steps over to Sullivan, who hugs him.
15.


SULLIVAN 
You’re a good lad.
Michael notes the gesture.
INT. SCHOOL ROOM - DAY
Michael sits at his DESK at the back of the classroom, gazing
out the window. His teacher drones on in the background.
Michael’s mind is elsewhere.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
Michael arrives home. He parks his bike.
He looks over toward the garage. He thinks.
He goes into the house.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - EVENING
It’s later. Rain had begun to fall. The door of the house
opens. Sullivan walks out of the house, toward the garage.
INT. SULLIVAN GARAGE - EVENING
Sullivan’s SHADOW appears in the doorway of the garage. He
enters.
He walks past the CAR. He unlocks a cupboard.
He takes a BLACK CASE from the cupboard and gets into the
car.
EXT. SULLIVAN GARAGE - EVENING
The car rolls out of the garage, into the rain.
INT/EXT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - NIGHT
The car pulls in outside the HOTEL FLORENCE. Sullivan looks
out the window.
CONNOR runs out the hotel and gets in the car, he sits in the
passenger seat.
The car pulls away.
16.

INT/EXT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - ROAD - NIGHT (MOVING)
Outskirts of town. Heading for the industrial area. Still
raining.
CONNOR
You want a shot?
Connor offers a flask. Sullivan shakes “No”. Connor shrugs
and drinks. Sullivan can tell he’s already high.
Then, Connor glances to the back of the car, sees SOMETHING.
The BLACK CASE.
SULLIVAN
We’re just talking to him. Right?
CONNOR
Sure.
Connor lights a cigarette, crumples the empty pack, and
tosses it over his shoulder.
CLOSE ON:
The BLACK CASE on the back seat.
Suddenly, the lid of the seat lifts, and we realize
MICHAEL IS INSIDE.
He lifts the seat a couple of inches and peeks out at
Sullivan and Connor in the front seat.
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
A narrow alley among the group of brick buildings.
Rain hammers the car as it rolls out of the shadows, lights
out.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - NIGHT
 MICHAEL’S POV: as he peeks out through his one inch GAP.
SOUND OF: Rain crumbing on the car roof.
Michael carefully lowers the seat.
SULLIVAN’s arm reaches over to pick up the black case.
CUT TO:
17.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - UNDER SEAT - NIGHT
Darkness.
SOUND OF: the case being opened on the back seat. Mechanical
sounds. Metal locking together. Canister snapping onto gun.
Car door shuts.
Michael, just visible, thinking.
SOUND OF: The rain on the car roof.
Slowly, Michael pulls himself out from the seat and looks out
the windshield:
MICHAEL’S POV: Dark alley. Glass blurred by rain. Then...
standing under a lamp over the back entrance to a WAREHOUSE,
he sees his father and Connor.
Connor is knocking on the DOOR. Sullivan is holding a long
black OBJECT.
Michael climbs into the front seat to see them better.
Breaths too hard on the window and it fogs. Wipes it away...
Connor and Sullivan have gone.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR (MINUTES LATER)
Michael sits in the driver’s seat. Keeping down, but
watching the warehouse door.
He makes a decision.
EXT. ALLY - NIGHT
Michael moves through the shadows.
He goes to the door. Hear VOICES inside, faint. He needs to
see.
Spots something further down the alley - A SMALL DOOR
A few planks at the bottom rotted away. Dim light spills out
into the alley.
Michael moves to the door. Peers in through THE gap at the
bottom.
MICHAEL’S POV: in the center of a huge WAREHOUSE, FINN
McGOVERN sits in a chair.
18.

Connor stands. He’s in the middle of talking to McGOVERN.
No sign of Sullivan.
CONNOR
...don’t get me wrong, Finn. I feel
for you. I do. But you can’t let a
thing like that give you cause to go
mouthing off. You and my dad go back
many years. He’s a just man.
(smiles sympathetically)
So what do you say?
McGovern glances beyond Connor’s shoulder at Sullivan, who we
don’t see.
SULLIVAN (O.S.)
Come on now, Finn. Let’s make this
easy.
McGovern nods.
MICHAEL’S POV: As Sullivan speaks, he steps right in front of
the door. From now on, Sullivan’s feet partially obscure
Michael’s view.
CONNOR
(slightly more
threatening)
We can’t hear you!
MCGOVERN
All right.
Connor smiles
CONNOR
Good. Thank you. And I am sorry.
I’m sorry for you loss. I’m sorry for
this misunderstanding...and I’m sorry
your brother was such a fuckin’ liar.
Connor makes for the door.
Two of McGovern’s men step out from the shadows. They are
carrying RIFLES.
CUT TO:
19.

INT/EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
MICHAEL’S POV: Sullivan’s shoes two feet in front of his
eyes.
CUT BACK TO:
McGovern ‘wrestling’ with himself - he wants to speak out.
MCGOVERN
My brother was not a liar.
Connor stops. Slight smile. Turns... nothing the two men,
who close in around McGovern.
Michael sees the shadows, but doesn’t see the men yet.
CONNOR
Excuse me?
MCGOVERN
To protect my family, and keep my job,
I’ll stay quiet. But don’t think I
don’t know something’s going on. And
don’t think I won’t find out what it
is.
Connor walks back toward McGovern.
CONNOR
Whoa...
MICHAEL’S POV: Through his father’s legs he sees the men
begin to raise their guns.
MCGOVERN
(to his men and Sullivan)
Easy. We’re just talking.
(to Connor)
You tell your father, my brother never
stole from him. I’ve checked the
books, he never sold no booze to noone. Every single barrel is accounted
for.
(beat)
Anyway if he’d’a sold it, where’s the
money?
CONNOR
Fuck should I know? D’you check his
mattress?
20.

MCGOVERN
Maybe you should check yours.
CONNOR
Look, there’s something immoral here,
don’t you think so Mike? My beloved
father throws your undeserving little
brother the wake of his life and this
is your thank you? What a hideous
world this is.
MCGOVERN
(rising to the bait)
You think you’re so smart?! You think
we don’t know? I mean, you’ve been
spending so much time in Chicago...
Connor whips out his PISTOL and puts two bullets into
McGovern.
As the COHORTS raise their rifles, SULLIVAN opens FIRE.
The killing of all three men lasts five seconds: sudden,
brutal, swift.
The huge volume of the GUNFIRE echoes in the room.
MICHAEL’S POV: through Sullivan’s legs. Brass casings fall
in front of his eyes. Horrified.
The bloodied face of one of the men hits the floor directly
in front of Michael’s face. Eyes open.
Michael frozen in terror.
CUT BACK TO:
Connor, exhilarate and frightened. He stands, breathing
heavily.
SULLIVAN
(angry)
What was that?
CONNOR
We’re outta here.
Connor moves to the door. Sullivan is left standing.
SULLIVAN
Jesus Christ, Conor! What the hell
are you thinking.
21.


Connor keeps walking.
Connor sees a HAND under the small door.
CONNOR
(pointing)
There.
Then Sullivan sees it. He runs to the door.
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Sullivan barges out into the alley, brandishing his Tommy
Gun, and chasing the fleeing figure.
His exit is blocked by and iron fence, Michael cowers.
Sullivan lowers his gun as he catches up to him. Then he
sees who it is...
SULLIVAN
Oh, Jesus.
Michael recoils. Sullivan stares in disbelief. Finally
approaches, gun hanging at his side.
SULLIVAN 
Michael
Michael cowers. Can’t answer.
SULLIVAN 
Are you hurt?
A long beat. Michael crouches there in shock, trapped at the
end of the alley. He shakes his head no.
SULLIVAN 
You saw everything?
(off his nod)
Jesus.
He glances back to Connor, mind reeling, suddenly calculating
a new host of dangers. Michael shivers in the rain.
SULLIVAN 
You are not to speak of this to
anyone. You understand? Not anyone!
Connor approaches. Michael stares at the two men, nightmare
figures standing there, looking at him.
22.


CONNOR
Who’s this?
(starring at Michael)
Is this one of yours?
SULLIVAN
He must’ve been hiding in the car.
CONNOR
(calm sobriety)
Can he keep a secret?
SULLIVAN
He’s my son.
The two men gauge each other, tense.
Connor re-groups, looks at Michael one last time, then turns
to Sullivan.
CONNOR
Good enough for me. You take him
home. I think I’ll walk.
(((( Puts his collar up)
Perfect night for a stroll
Connor steps from the doorway into the pouring rain.
Sullivan watches him walk down the alley.
Without turning back, Connor waves good night.
EXT. SULLIVAN GARAGE
The car pulls into the garage.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - SULLIVAN GARAGE - NIGHT
SULLIVAN kills the engine. They stare out at their home.
Neither ready to go in.
MICHAEL
Does Mama know?
SULLIVAN
You mother knows I love Mr. Rooney.
When we had nothing, he gave us a
home. A life. And we owe him. Do
you understand?
Michael looks to Sullivan. Pause.
23.


SULLIVAN 
Do you understand?
MICHAEL
Yes.
SULLIVAN
Come on inside.
ANNIE
Boys, clear you plates, please.
MICHAEL
I’ll do it later.
ANNIE
It’s time for school now, justMICHAEL
It’s only a plate.
Annie, puzzled, looks to Sullivan for support... Sullivan
just looks at the table, unable to respond.
Annie is amazed.
CAR HORN sounds outside.
24.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MORNING
A large, BLACK CAR [Pierce Arrow] pulls up to the house.
Peter rushes out. JIMMY is driving. He gets pit of the car
and opens the back door. ROONEY steps out. HUGS Peter.
ROONEY
Peter!
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)
Sullivan watches, concerned as Michael comes out of the
house. Annie comes to the window, next to him.
ANNIE
What’s he doing here?
Sullivan looks to Annie.
SULLIVAN
Michael was hiding in the car when I
wen out last night.
ANNIE
Oh Jesus, MikeSULLIVAN
(cutting her off)
I’ve spoken to him. It won’t happen
again.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MORNING
Michael walks his bicycle toward the road. Rooney approaches
him.
ROONEY
Just the feller!
(surreptitious)
Our secret, right?
Michael looks at him nervous. Rooney frowns.
ROONEY 
I’m talking about the dice.
Rooney hands him a large silver coin. Michael takes it,
reluctantly.
ROONEY 
A man of honor always pays his
debts...
25.
(MORE)

(he leans in, close)
...and keeps his word.
MICHAEL
I’m gonna be late for school.
Michael pedals away. Rooney WATCHES him.
Sullivan comes out of the house, putting on his coat.
Rooney looks at the window. Annie watches him. He waves,
friendly.
CLOSE: Annie, worried.
EXT. ROCK ISLAND RESTAURANT - MORNING
Establishing shot.
INT. ROCK ISLAND RESTAURANT - MORNING
Sullivan and Rooney sit inside a booth having coffee. This
is Rooney’s local restaurant.
ROONEY
How is Michael? Is he OK?
SULLIVAN
(grateful)
I’ve spoken to him. He understands.
ROONEY
That’s tough, seeing that for the
first time.
Sullivan remembers and nods. Rooney smiles, warmly;
ROONEY 
Well--you turned out.
(sensing his distress)
You can’t protect him forever. If it
wasn’t this, it’d be something else.
(Off Sullivan’s look.)
Natural law. Sons are put on this
earth to trouble their fathers.
Sullivan loves this man.
26.

ROONEY 
INT. SCHOOL ROOM - DAY
A cheering crowd of boys encouraging a FIGHT. As we move
closer we see that it’s MICHAEL fighting with another
(bigger) boy. Michael punches and kicks wildly - completely
out of control.
INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - GRAND PARLOR - EARLY EVENING
ROONEY sits at the head of the long table. CONNOR on his
right. SULLIVAN, behind, in shadow. Rooney’s bodyguards
SEAN and JIMMY stand at the door.
Eight other MEN at the table: representatives of various arms
of the business: Distilleries. Casinos. Brothels. Food,
coffee, drinks on the table. It’s towards the end of a
meeting.
There is ONE EMPTY CHAIR at the table: the one FINN McGOVERN
used to sit in.
JACK KELLY, a man in his 50’s, smart suit, the family’s
accountant and lawyer is in mid-speech:
KELLY
John also made it clear that Finn
McGovern’s operation will be divided
up locally among two territories that
John will select personally. I’d like
to take this moment to thank our
friend Mister Rance, for interrupting
a busy travel schedule to pay us a
visit.
RANCE is introduced, sitting at the table. He drinks lemon
tea. He nods.
RANCE
Thank you, Jack.
KELLY
Mister Rance met with John and me
earlier to make another bid for our
involvement in the unions.
ROONEY
And I told Mister Rance what I told
him before. What men do after work is
what made us all rich. No need to
screw ‘em at work as well.
27.

KELLY
Is there any other business?
ROONEY
Yes
Rooney glances at an empty chair. A pause.
ROONEY 
Connor, is there something you would
like to say about last night?
He looks at his son. CONNOR clearly wasn’t planning on
talking. He’s unprepared and misreads the atmosphere...
CONNOR
(from his chair)
I’d like to apologize for what
happened. Especially toy you, Pa - two
wakes in a month, what can I say?
Pause. Some laughter in the room. Rooney is furious.
ROONEY
We lost a good man last night. You
think it’s funny? Try again...
Connor tries to maintain his cool.
CONNOR
I’d like to apologize for--
Bang! Rooney slams his hand on the table.
ROONEY
(not looking at him)
You would like to apologize? TRY
AGAIN!
Connor pushes away his chair and stands, like a disobedient
child. The room doesn’t know where to look.
CONNOR
Gentlemen. My apologies.
ON CONNOR: humiliated. An uncomfortable pause. Kelly, a
decent man, lets Connor off the hook by moving on:
KELLY
Is everyone clear about bit-borrowers?
There’s been far too many debts
outstanding.
28.


ROONEY
Mike?
SULLIVAN
Just give me their names. Tell me who
to visit.
ROONEY
Thank you gentlemen.
(to Sullivan)
Come upstairs.
They all get up.
Rooney puts his arm around Sullivan as they exit. Warm and
familiar.
CONNOR observes this. The room empties.
He sits at the head of the huge table , alone. Deep in
thought.
INT. SCHOOL ROOM - NIGHT
Michael has been kept behind after school. His TEACHER is
marking books.
Michael writes lines on the blackboard: I WILL NOT FIGHT
WITH OTHER BOYS.
EXT. ROONEY’S MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT (LATER)
It’s later. Sullivan walks to his car.
CONNOR
Mike!
Sullivan turns. Connor approaches him. He takes out a
SEALED ENVELOPE.
CONNOR 
Dad forgot to give you this. Reminder
for Tony Calvino.
Sullivan takes the letter, puts it in his coat pocket.
CONNOR 
He’s light again.
SULLIVAN
You coming?
29.


CONNOR
Nah.
(slight smile)
I’m under house arrest for a while.
(beat)
Look, I’m sorry about last night. I
am. I was... you know.
Beat.
SULLIVAN
Alright.
SULLIVAN gets in the car. Connor waves him off.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Sullivan gets out of his car and makes for the BACK ENTRANCE
of CALVINO’s speakeasy.
He gets to the stairway, leading to a BASEMENT DOOR.
A sign: SUBWAY POOL AND BILLIARDS. A bouncer (FRANK) stands
at the bottom of the stairs. He turns.
FRANK
Help you sir, or just lookin’?
SULLIVAN
Here to see Tony Calvino.
FRANK
Yeah, and who are you?
SULLIVAN
Mike Sullivan
Frank pales.
FRANK
Oh. Yes sir.
SULLIVAN
You gonna frisk me?
FRANK
Should I?
SULLIVAN
It’s a good idea.
Frank pats him down, and finds a gun.
30.


SULLIVAN 
That’s the only one.
INT. FLORENCE HOTEL - CONNOR’S SUITE - NIGHT
A plush room. Lit by a single lamp. Connor sits in an
armchair.
Wearing his coat. He takes a slug of his drink. Looks at
his watch.
INT. SUBWAY POOL & BILLIARDS - NIGHT
Frank escorts Sullivan through the club. He’s very nervous
in Sullivan’s presence.
They’re in a BAR area, dancing couples. A JAZZ BAND plays.
LOUD. FRANK SHOUTS above them:
FRANK
I mean, I’m not a grown man and this
place is getting to me. Every night
there’s trouble. Nobody’s got no
dough, but all the world’s here
wasting it. Always money for frills
and twists, never money for food.
Sometimes I despair of the species you
know?
They go through yet another door, finding themselves in A
BROTHEL. The room is filled with chairs. PROSTITUTES sit
around as MEN walk amongst them, making their selection. An
older WOMAN standing at the door, shouts out a number:
WOMAN
Number Twelve in the beauty parlor.
Who’s the lucky face?
A GIRL approaches a CUSTOMER who nods to her. He and his
WHORE head through a door. Sullivan and FRANK follow them
back into... A CORRIDOR.
FRANK
I’m not from here originally. Things
being what they are, jobs ain’t
hanging off of trees.
Sullivan and Frank pass other closed velvet curtains. Sounds
of sex within.
31.


FRANK 
I’m a boxer by trade - nine
consecutive titles. A record for
South Orange. I’d make a pretty good
bodyguard, I think.
They get to the end of the corridor.
FRANK 
What I’m saying... is Mr. Rooney
looking for anyone...anyone like me,
for example? Any chance you might ask
him?
SULLIVAN
Sure.
FRANK
Oh, thank you, Mr. Sullivan. Thank
you very much. I appreciate it.
FRANK knocks on the door of the OFFICE and goes in, leaving
Sullivan in the hall with another GUARD.
INT. CALVINO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
FRANK comes in. Facing him is TONY CALVINO, 30’s, drug
addled.
His office is a mess. Buckets catch dripping water from
overhead pipes.
He sits at his desk, inhaling dope form under a glass. He
looks up at FRANK, stoned.
FRANK
Mr. Calvino...Mike Sullivan’s here.
CALVINO
Aaah, shit.
FRANK
He wants to see you.
CALVINO
Aaah, shit. Is he packing?
FRANK
(proudly)
Not any more.
32.


CALVINO
(unwilling)
All right. Show him in. Hey...you
stick around, OK?
Frank nods and goes to the door. CALVINO takes a .38 out of
his drawer, lays it on the desk, covers it with a MAGAZINE.
Other OBJECTS on the desk are reverberating from the LOUD
MUSIC next door. FRANK shows Sullivan in.
CALVINO 
(obsequious)
Hey, how the hell are you? Things
good with the old man?
SULLIVAN
Yeah.
CALVINO
What brings you here? Don’t imagine
it’s the pussy.
SULLIVAN
I have a letter for you from Mr.
Rooney.
Sullivan hands the envelope to him.
CALVINO
(innocently)
Am I behind again?
Sullivan nods.
CALVINO 
Am I in trouble?
SULLIVAN
I don’t know.
CALVINO reaches for the letter opener. He slits the end of
the envelope.
Sullivan glances at the magazine on the desk. CALVINO
unfolds the letter. Reads. No Reaction.
CLOSE: Sullivan’s nothing CALVINO’s lack of reaction.
The walls reverberate with the MUSIC outside.
Sullivan’s eyes flick down to the table.
33.


CLOSE ON THE MAGAZINE: the vibrations of the MUSIC jolt it,
revealing a glimpse of a GUN.
CALVINO holds the letter. Thinks. Looks up at Sullivan.
CALVINO flicks eyes at FRANK who is standing behind Sullivan.
A long beat.
SULLIVAN senses CALVINO go for the gun. As Calvino shifts in
his chair Sullivan whips the gun from under the magazine and
SHOOTS him in the head.
Calvino falls head first onto the desk, scattering everything
on it.
In a flash, Sullivan has turned on FRANK. Frank is fumbling
with his gun.
Sullivan shoots him. The force of the bullet throws him
against the wall. Outside the music finishes.
The LETTER lies on the desk. Sullivan picks it up and reads
it.
REVERSE: The note reads: ‘KILL SULLIVAN AND ALL DEBTS ARE
PAID’.
SULLIVAN 
(sudden realization)
Michael
Sullivan reaches for the phone.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
The hall at the front of the stairs is dark. A bar of light
finds the phone on the table in the hall - off the hook.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
The bathroom is steamy. PETER has just got out of the tub.
Annie dries his hair with a towel. They are both laughing.
ANNIE hears something, looks up.
The bathroom DOOR opens. A MAN wearing a balaclava stands in
the doorway.
He’s holding a GUN. He Raises it. Annie shields the boy and
SCREAMS.
CLOSE: The man’s eyes. Blinking in fear.
34.


CLOSE: The gun shaking in the man’s hand.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - NIGHT
Michael is CYCLING up the drive. Hears a single GUNSHOT. He
looks up to the HOUSE. In a top floor window: a FLASH and a
second GUNSHOT.
Michael abandons his bike and runs towards the house.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT
The MAN comes down the stairs.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - NIGHT
Michael stands in front of the door. The MAN suddenly
APPEARS.
Michael sees him through the glass. The MAN takes off his
balaclava. It’s CONNOR
He is looking AT MICHAEL. The boy freezes.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT
CONNOR’s POV: He’s not staring at Michael, he is staring at
his own reflection in the glass of the door.
He tries to compose himself. He pushes the door open...
Michael is gone.
Connor starts out -
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - NIGHT
-- and Michael is hiding behind the door. Connor doesn’t see
him. He takes out hi HIP FLASK, takes a huge swig. He is
drunk already. He RUNS down the driveway.
Michael stands in the darkness. He turns and goes thought
the front door.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - ENTERANCE HALL - NIGHT
Michael stand in the darkened hall, sees the phone off the
hook on the table.
He moves to the bottom of the stairs. Looks up. At the top
of the stairs a fine mist of GUNSMOKE swirls in a draft.
35.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Sullivan’s CAR hurtles down the street at top speed.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - LANDING OUTSIDE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sullivan comes through the front door and stops.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Ahead of him, Michael is sitting at the dining table.
Completely still.
Sullivan looks at him. Weird, terrible atmosphere. Sullivan
runs upstairs.
Michael sits alone.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - OUTSIDE BATHROOM - NIGHT
Sullivan sits on the floor, against the wall, head in hands,
in despair. The bathroom light is now OFF.
Michael comes up the stairs, slowly. Stands at the top.
Sullivan looks at him.
Michael stares back. Pause.
INT. CONNOR’S APARTMENT - HOTEL FLORENCE - NIGHT
Rooney has entered Connor’s room and approaches him.
CONNOR
Pa? I-I, I’m sorry.
(beat)
Well, he... would’ve talked. The kid
would’ve talked.
ROONEY
STUPID!
36.

CONNOR
The kid would’ve talked. I’m sorry.
Rooney starts hitting Connor, unable to verbalize or satisfy
his rage - Connor whimpers and sobs, cowering from the blows.
ROONEY
(shouting)
GODDAMN YOU!
ROONEY 
GODDAMN YOU...I CURSE THE FUCKIN’ DAY
YOU WERE BORN! I CURSE IT! YOU!
Shaking, he loses the strength
ROONEY 
Oh, Lord. Oh, no.
Connor cries in his arms. Rooney embraces him.
ROONEY 
(in a whisper)
Oh, Lord. God help us. God help us.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - HALL ENTRANCE - NIGHT
The front door is open. Michael stands outside with his bag.
Sullivan walks out of the house with his case. Slams the
door.
Hold on the EMPTY HOUSE.
EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - NIGHT
Sullivan walks to Michael, who looks back at the house.
SULLIVAN
This house is not our home anymore.
It’s just an empty building.
Michael turns away from his home and gets in the car with his
father.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - NIGHT
On the backseat: their two bags. And the BLACK CASE.
The sound of the car starting up.
37.

EXT. HOTEL FLORENCE -NIGHT
Sullivan’s car pulls up in the shadows outside Connor’s
hotel.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - NIGHT
Sullivan kills the engine. He goes to get out but Michael
physically holds on to him, not letting him move.
MICHAEL
Don’t go, Pa. Don’t go.
Sullivan’s heart breaks. He bends down to him to explain.
SULLIVAN
Michael, tomorrow when they find out
we’re gone, they’re gonna come after
us. I have to protect you now.
MICHAEL
Please, Pa.
Sullivan wavers, fighting himself.
SULLIVAN
All right, here. Take this.
Then he takes a small PISTOL (a .38 snub nose) from his coat.
He tries to give it to Michael, but he won’t unclench his
hand.
MICHAEL
No.
SULLIVAN
Michael, take it.
MICHAEL
Don’t want it. I don’t want it, Pa!
SULLIVAN
Boy, take it!
Sullivan opens his fingers and presses the GUN into his palm.
SULLIVAN 
You got six shots.
Michael stares at his father, his bloodshot eyes.
38.

SULLIVAN 
If I’m not back in half and hour, you
go see Reverent Lynch at First
Methodist and you tell him what
happened. Do not go to Father
Callaway.
Michael shrinks away, gun in his hand, scared. Sullivan
takes one last look at him and then gets out of the car.
EXT. ALLEY - BEHIND THE HOTEL - NIGHT
Sullivan has come around the side of the building and is
starting to climb the hotel FIRE ESCAPE.
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
Sullivan gets to the second floor landing, looks in a window.
Sullivan forces the window open and silently climbs in. He
reaches out to open a door.
He expects it to be locked. The door swings slowly open.
INT. CONNOR’S APARTMENT - HOTEL FLORENCE - NIGHT
It’s CONNOR’s room. Sullivan enters, gun ready - but not
ready for how he meets.
In middle of the room he sees, not Connor, but JOE KELLY.
SULLIVAN
Don’t have any business with you, Mr.
Kelly.
KELLY
But I have business with you, Mike.
SULLIVAN
Go ahead.
He picks up a black bag. Places it ont the table.
SULLIVAN 
What is that?
KELLY
Twenty-five thousand dollars. Mr.
Rooney wants you to know there’s more
if you want it.
Beat. Sullivan registers the mention of Rooney.
39.


KELLY 
You have friends in Ireland, Mike.
Why don’t you take Peter and leave.
SULLIVAN
I can’t take Peter. He’s dead.
Beat. Kelly regroups.
SULLIVAN 
Where’s Connor?
KELLY
He’s in hiding.
SULLIVAN
Where?
KELLY
You know I can’t tell you that, Mike.
Sullivan pulls out the gun, aims at Kelly’s head.
KELLY 
(steely)
You think sticking a gun to my head is
going to make a difference to me? If
I tell you, I’m a dead man anyway. We
both are.
Sullivan cocks the gun as his reply. Kelly remains tough.
KELLY 
Think Mike - don’t be stupid.
(beat)
I’m just a messenger.
Beat. Sullivan re-groups.
SULLIVAN
Then give Mr. Rooney a message for me.
KELLY
What is it?
BANG. And with that, Sullivan is no longer the man he was.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - NIGHT
Michael huddles with his gun. A long moment goes by. And
the Sullivan gets into the car.
40.


SULLIVAN
Give me the gun.
Michael looks at his father, shaking, blood on his
outstretched hand. Sullivan takes the gun, and starts the
engine.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - NIGHT (MOVING)
Michael huddles in a blanket. His father drives in silence.
MICHAEL
Where are we going?
SULLIVAN
T Chicago. There’s a man there who
runs things. I’ve done some work for
him.
(beat)
We have to find out where he stands.
(beat)
Try to get some sleep.
In exhaustion, Michael leans his head against the door. He
begins to fall asleep.
EXT. HIGHWAY THROUGH SNOW-COVERED FIELDS - DAWN
Sky lightens over endless fields. The car moves across the
landscape.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - DAY (MORNING)
Michael awakens. He looks out the window.
REFLECTED IN THE GLASS: Buildings. Skyscrapers. CHICAGO.
Michael looks out.
EXT. CHICAGO - DAY
CLOSE ON THE CAR as it drives into the towering city.
CRANE UP, as the car slips into the stream of traffic,
becoming anonymous.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Sullivan and Michael walk towards us in a sea of early
morning city workers.
41.

INT. READING ROOM - PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
A huge ROOM full of PEOPLE reading newspapers; the POOR
escape the cold, MOTHERS with BABIES, STUDENTS, the OLD.
Sullivan leads Michael to a desk and sits him down.
SULLIVAN
I want you to wait for me here.
MICHAEL
(anxious)
Sure.
SULLIVAN
I won’t be long. You’ll be all right?
Michael tries to be stoic.
MICHAEL
Yeah, I’ll be all right.
SULLIVAN
You’re a good boy.
Michael notes, and appreciates, the off-handed complement.
EXT. LEXINGTON HOTEL - DAY
SULLIVAN stands across the street from the marble pillars
framing the entrance of the vast hotel.
DOORMEN and BELL-HOPS throng the glass doorways.
INT. LOBBY - LEXINGTON HOTEL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
Sullivan walks through the MAGNIFICENT LOBBY to the
elevators. He knows the way.
Two MEN in suits guard one elevator in particular. No one
gets in. Sullivan approaches.
HARRY
Hello, Mike.
SULLIVAN
Hello, fellas.
HARRY
It’s nice to see you. We heard what
happened. How you holding up?
42.

SULLIVAN
I need to talk to Mr. Nitti.
HARRY
He’s awful busy.
SULLIVAN
I can wait.
HARRY
(to Marco)
OK. Take the man to the top.
Marco frisks Sullivan. A matter of course. Sullivan gets in
the lift with Marco. The doors close.
INT. READING ROOM - DAY
It is later. Michael is still sitting, reading.
CLOSE: Plate: “The Lone Ranger had the Sheriff covered.” The
same page.
We see his face now, blank.
Then, for no discernible reason, his face crumples. He
begins to cry, to grieve for his mother and brother.
INT. LEXINGTON HOTEL - TOP FLOOR - WAITING ROOM - DAY
BUSINESSMEN of varying degrees of repeatability, and some
SHADY-LOOKING FIGURES, smoking, reading, talking, drinking
coffee.
A SECRETARY at a desk outside the door that’s the focal point
of everything.
Sullivan sits, waiting. He checks his watch, he’s obviously
been there for a while. He settles his gaze on the
Secretary.
She catches it. She speaks into an intercom. Looks up at
Sullivan. Nods.
INT. NITTI’S OFFICE - DAY
A man in a finely-tailored banker’s suit, FRANK NITTI, 40’s,
welcomes Sullivan into the room. He is second in command for
the Capone organization. He chain smokes.
He is friendly but distant.
43.


NITTI
Sorry to keep you waiting so long,
Mike.
Nitti takes in Sullivan’s appearance.
NITTI 
We all just heard what happened.
Jesus, I’m sorry.
Sullivan remains standing, holding his hat. He is nervous.
SULLIVAN
Thank you for seeing me Mr. Nitti.
NITTI
Come on, sit down. Would you like
some coffee, or -
SULLIVAN
No.
NITTI
You sure?
SULLIVAN
Yes. Thank you.
NITTI
So, what can I do for you, Mike?
SULLIVAN
I would like to work for you.
Beat. Nitti didn’t expect this.
NITTI
Well, that’s very interesting.
SULLIVAN
And in return, I’d like you to turn a
blind eye to...what I have to do.
NITTI
And what is that?
Beat.
SULLIVAN
Kill the man who murdered my family.
Sullivan looks for a reaction. Nitti is still as stone.
44.


NITTI
Is one more body going to make a
difference?
SULLIVAN
This is a good proposal Mr. Nitti. I
will work only for you...and you know
I can do a good job.
NITTI
I respect you, Mike, I do. And we
would like nothing more than to have
you come and work for us. But not
like this. What you’re asking me is
impossible.
SULLIVAN
Is it?
NITTI
Let me explain something to you that
maybe you haven’t realized. All
these years, you’ve been living under
the protection of people who care
about you. And those same people are
protecting you now. Including me. So
open that door, you’re walking through
it alone. And all that loyalty, and
all that trust will no longer exist
for you... And Mike - you won’t make
it. Not on your own. Not with a
little boy.
Beat.
SULLIVAN
You’re protecting him already?
NITTI
We’re protecting our interests.
Nitti looks at Sullivan’s haggard face, his red eyes.
SULLIVAN
I drove through the night to see you.
NITTI
I appreciate that, and now I suggest
you drive yourself back. Go home,
Mike. Go home and bury your wife and
child. With our blessing.
45.


SULLIVAN
(exiting)
It won’t be that simple.
INT. LEXINGTON HOTEL - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR & ELEVATOR - DAY
Several eyes turn to Sullivan as he walks toward the
elevator. He steps inside the elevator with Marco and two
other BUSINESSMEN. Marco eyes him.
Then, just as the elevator doors are about to shut, he steps
out, and moves swiftly down the corridor towards the stairs
INT. LOBBY - LEXINGTON HOTEL - DAY
Sullivan walks from the service stairs, and disappears
amongst the people thronging the lobby.
INT. SIDE ROOM - DAY
Nitti enters form his office. Sitting there in an easy chair
is...ROONEY. On another chair: CONNOR.
NITTI
You heard?
Rooney nods.
Connor makes a rational, precise plea.
CONNOR
Dad, listen to me. He’s in the
building. You can end this now.
You’ve got to take him now.
ROONEY
Connor. Get upstairs.
Rooney stares at his son until Connor walks out. He puts his
head in his hands.
ROONEY 
God help me.
(pause)
What do I do
NITTI
(gently)
You think objectively. And you make
your choice. What would you do if
Sullivan were just... some guy?
46.


ROONEY
God help me.
Rooney looks up at Nitti. Tears in his eyes.
ROONEY 
Make it quick.
NITTI
(nods)
And the kid?
ROONEY
Oh, Christ. No.
NITTI
And one day, the kid becomes a man.
Think he won’t remember?
A beat.
ROONEY
I said, not the kid.
Beat. Rooney looks at Nitti.
NITTI
Alright. I know who to call.
EXT. STREET - DAY
A man about 30 (MAGUIRE) walks swiftly along the sidewalk
carrying a camera. As he walks.
NITTI 
There’s a guy who’s done some work for
us in the past... He’s gifted.
A small crowd has gathered on the fire escape entrance to a
tenement block. Onlookers at the scene of a murder.
Maguire pushes his way through the crowd.
MAGUIRE
Excuse me, ma’am. Press! Press!
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY
Maguire enters a dingy tenement. A crime scene.
POLICE and MEDICS are attending to the MURDERER who is highly
distressed, cuts on his arms ect.
47.


MURDERER
He was raping my wife, he fucking
raped my wife.
POLICE MAN
(trying to usher the man
out)
Come on! Come on! You’re treading on
the evidence here.
The Policeman ushers the murderer outside.
MAGUIRE
Two minutes.
Maguire slips another POLICE MAN some CASH.
POLICE MAN
You got it, Mr. Maguire.
The room is quiet not. Maguire steps behind the tripod and
begins to focus. The image of the man UPSIDE-DOWN in his
viewfinder.
Now we see the body: A big OAF of a corpse with his trousers
down. Clearly, a crime of passion.
Just as Maguire’s about to take the shot the corpse exhales,
gulps for air, blood trickling out of its mouth.
ON MAGUIRE: This stiff’s alive. SOUND OF: An L-Train
approaching.
Maguire glances at the closed door, shrugs and then takes a
handkerchief from his top pocket and gently pinches the OAF’s
nose closed.
The OAF struggles for a few seconds. MAGUIRE looks in the
eyes as he dies.
The L-Train THUNDERS PAST.
INT. MAGUIRE’S APARTMENT - DARK ROOM - NIGHT
Red light. CLOSE: An image of the dead OAF is finished out
of a tray of fixing solution. MAGUIRE hangs it up to dry

The PHONE rings. Maguire snaps on the LIGHT and opens the
doorINT. MAGUIRE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Maguire goes into the living room where he picks up the
PHONE.
MAGUIRE
(in phone)
Harlem Maguire... Good-evening, Mr.
Nitti.
He listens to Nitti on the other end of the phone.
MAGUIRE 
Uh huh...sixteen hundred.
(beat)
Sixteen hundred dollars is my rate,
Mr. Nitti. And what I make on the
photographs is mine.
He writes on a PAD. CLOSE: Maguire’s handwriting: ‘Michael
Sullivan’.
MAGUIRE 
No, never met him, but I know his
work.
Now we see the FRAMED PHOTOS on Maguire’s apartment walls:
Dead bodies: in corridors, pool halls, bath tubs, ect.
MAGUIRE 
He traveling alone? How old?
CLOSE: the PAD. Maguire’s handwriting: ‘Michael Sullivan +
Jr. 12 years old’ Maguire turns the ‘1’ of the ‘12’ into a
square and makes it a ‘face’ by drawing two dots for eyes...
MAGUIRE 
What do I do with the kid? Uh huh...
will do. Thank you.
Maguire draws a down-turned mouth on the doodled face of
‘Michael’.
DISSOLVE TO:

SULLIVAN
You remember your Aunt Sarah? Your
mom’s sister? She lives in Perdition.
She’ll take you in.

Where is that?
SULLIVAN
Right by the lake. We went there
once, all of us, when you were four,
maybe five. It’s beautiful. You
remember?
Michael nods.
MICHAEL
The place with the dog.
Sullivan looks at Michael, puzzled.
Sullivan drives, lost in the memory for just a moment.

Michael sits in the last pew of a small church. He watches
his father from the back.
Sullivan kneels at the altar - praying.
CLOSE - Reveal Sullivan’s anguished face, as he prays for the
souls of his wife and child.
50.


Michael looks down and sees a basket of small plaster
Madonnas. Picks one out, looks at it.
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
CLOSE: OLD PHOTOS:
A Sullivan family portrait - Annie and the kids together.
Sullivan to one side, slightly detached.
Michael and Peter aged five and four.
Sullivan and Connor in their mid-teens, Rooney with his arms

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE- HALLWAY - NIGHT
SARAH goes to the phone on the HALL table and picks up.
INT. OFFICE - STARR MOTEL - NIGHT
Sullivan is on the phone. The MOTEL MANAGER, an elderly man,
does paperwork behind the desk.
SULLIVAN
Sarah?
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
SARAH
(hushed tones)
Mike. Thank God...
SULLIVAN
I want you to know we’re okay.
SARAH
Where are you?
During the following, we glimpse MAGUIRE listening to the
conversation at the top of the stairs.
SULLIVAN
We’re on our way to your place, if
that’s all right.
51.


SARAH
(relieved)
Of course. I’ll be back there in two
days. How’s Michael?
Beat.
SULLIVAN
He’s alright.
(beat)
How was it?
SARAH
Oh, Mike...
Pause. Sullivan stands there. At a loss for words. Holding
himself together.
SARAH 
Hello...?
SULLIVAN
We’ll see you soon.
He puts the phone down.
CUT TO:
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - LANDING/HALLWAY - NIGHT
MAGUIRE calmly walks down the stairs. Approaches the phone
on the hallway table.
Picks it up.
MAGUIRE
Hello, operator. I was just cut off,
could you reconnect me?
CUT TO:
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - THE ROAD - DAY (MORNING)
Michael’s face looks out the window.
America passes by, in all its vastness. Fields. Forests.
Churches. Barns. Lines of telephone poles stretch into the
distance.
52.

INT. STARR MOTEL ROOM - DAY
A wide shot of the room in which Sullivan and Michael have
recently spent the night: unmade beds, ect.
Maguire stands silhouetted in the doorway. Looks. A plaster
Madonna sits on the night stand.
EXT. BOXCAR DINER - ROAD TO PERDITION - SUNSET
Sign outside: ‘We Never Close’. The sun is setting.
Sullivan’s car pulls up outside the dinner. Sullivan is
tired and dirtied from a hard day’s driving. He stops the
car.
SULLIVAN
You hungry?
Michael looks down when he replies
MICHAEL
No.
SULLIVAN
Might not be another diner for a
while. You should have something to
eat.
MICHAEL
I’m not hungry. I just wanna read.
And with that, Sullivan’s out the door.
Michael sits in the car by himself, sullen.
INT. MAGUIRE’S CAR - OPEN ROAD - NIGHT (MOVING)
Maguire driving. Focused hard on the empty road.
A pistol and a camera on the seat beside him.
He sees a light ahead, starts to slow...
INT. DINER/EXT
Sullivan is eating steak with a proper steak knife. He looks
through the window, half expecting his son to give up his
stubbornness and join him.
POV: Michael’s head is no longer visible in the car.
53.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - NIGHT
Michael is asleep on the back seat, covered with Sullivan’s
coat. His comic boot is still open.
Lights from a passing vehicle sweep through the car.
EXT. BOXCAR DINER - NIGHT
Maguire’s car pulls up and stops.
Maguire gets out of his car, sees Sullivan looking out the
window, as he drinks a cup of coffee.
Maguire glances at Sullivan’s car: No one there. Notices a
parked police car.
INT. BOXCAR DINER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
The bell above the door DINGS.
Maguire comes in, sits in the next booth to Sullivan, but
facing him.
Looks over Sullivan’s shoulder. Registers the FARMER and the
COP sitting at the counter.
A waitress (RUBY) approaches Maguire.
MAGUIRE
Slow night, huh?
RUBY
You kiddin’? This is busy! What can I
get you?
MAGUIRE
You got a special?
RUBY
Everything’s special.
MAGUIRE
Is that so?
RUBY
Everything ‘cept the food.
Maguire laughs.
54.

MAGUIRE
“Everything ‘cept the food!” You
oughtta be on the stage
RUBY
Don’t I know it.
MAGUIRE
Gimme some of that honey dip fired
chicken, and a black coffee.
RUBY
(cheerfully)
Duck soup.
Maguire takes a roll of film from his pocket and starts to
load his camera. Sullivan observes him.
Sullivan surreptitiously pours WHISKEY into his coffee cup,
looks back at Maguire, who’s looking straight at him.
MAGUIRE
Don’t mind me, sir.
SULLIVAN
Huh?
MAGUIRE
(whispers)
It’s a free country - Used to be,
anyhow!
Sullivan smiles. And pours more drink into his cup. Keeps
watching the man loading his camera.
Sullivan offers Maguire the whiskey.
MAGUIRE 
No thank you, sir.
Maguire snaps his camera shut. Loaded.
SULLIVAN
Is that your profession or your
pleasure.
MAGUIRE
Both I guess. To be paid to do what
you love, ain’t that the dream.
SULLIVAN
I guess so.
55.


MAGUIRE
Yourself?
Beat.
SULLIVAN
I’m a salesman. Machine parts.
MAGUIRE
Machine parts? That’s wonderful!
SULLIVAN
I assure you, it is not. So who do
you work for?
MAGUIRE
Can you keep a secret?
(whispers)
I’m “Press”.
SULLIVAN
Which paper?
MAGUIRE
All over. I’m something of a rarity.
SULLIVAN
How’s that?
MAGUIRE
I shoot the dead.
(pause)
Dead bodies, that is. I don’t kill
‘em!
SULLIVAN
Should hope not.
MAGUIRE
Always fascinated me...the look of
‘em, you know? You ever seen one?
Sullivan nods.
MAGUIRE 
Sorry for you. Terrible thing. But
it sure makes you feel alive, don’t
it?
SULLIVAN
I’ll drink to that.
56.


Sullivan drinks. Maguire is looking at the COP over
Sullivan’s shoulder. He’s just finishing up and paying.
Maguire turns back to Sullivan.
MAGUIRE
Stuff makes you sweat, huh?
SULLIVAN
Piss, too.
Sullivan surreptitiously palms his steak knife.
SULLIVAN 
(to Ruby)
Excuse me, ma’am. Can you help me out
here?
RUBY
(gesturing)
Just through there.
Sullivan stands up unsteadily. Moves toward the John, trips.
MAGUIRE
Hey! Look out there!
Sullivan looks back toward the empty cup.
SULLIVAN
Whoah.
He moves off.
COP
Thanks, Ruby.
RUBY
Good night.
The COP leaves. The bell above the door DINGS.
Maguire watches. Feels in his pockets. Pulls out the gun.
The SOUND of a car starting up.
Maguire checks the gun under the table.
The bell above the door DINGS. The COP walks back in.
COP
Forgot to leave a tip...
57.


Maguire realizes, turns.
Sullivan’s car accelerates away.
Maguire leaps up, runs outside.
EXT. BOXCAR DINER - NIGHT
Maguire runs to his car. Stops. Looks down: The tires have
been slashed.
He looks off in the direction of Sullivan’s car. It’s
taillights receding into the distance.
CLOSE: Maguire. Steely. Focused. HE AIMS THE GUN.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - NIGHT (MOVING)
Sullivan drives, very fast. Dark, straight road. He opens
the window to sober up, though he is not nearly as drunk as
he appeared. Michael is still on the back seat.
SULLIVAN
GET DOWN!
MICHAEL
WHY? What’s going on--?
SULLIVAN
GET DOWN!
HE PHYSICALLY SHOVES HIM DOWN JUST AS --
THE BACK WINDOW OF THE CAR EXPLODES - glass shattering.
EXT. DINER - NIGHT
Maguire fires the gun a second time. Disappointed.
The Cop walks out of the diner.
COP
HEY, what do you think you’re doing--
Maguire simply turns around and shoots him.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
Sullivan spins the car off the road and heads into an open
field.
58.

INT. CAR/OPEN FIELD - NIGHT
Sullivan stops the car and turns to Michael - they’re both
out of breath. Sullivan is furious.
SULLIVAN
Get out of the car.
Michael doesn’t move. Sullivan opens the rear door and grabs
him.
SULLIVAN 
Get out of the car!
(beat)
When I say get down, you get down!
You don’t ask questions! When I say
we’re stopping to eat, you stay with
me!
(beat)
You listen to me from now on, or you
start taking care of yourself.
MICHAEL
I can take care of myself fine! You
never wanted me along anyway! You
think it’s my fault this happened!
SULLIVAN
Stop it Michael! IT WAS NOT YOUR
FAULT! None of this is your fault!
Michael registers this. But remains angry.
MICHAEL
Just take me to Aunt Sarah’s
SULLIVAN
I can’t take you there. Not now.
MICHAEL
Why?
SULLIVAN
He knows that’s where we’re going.
MICHAEL
So what are you gonna do?
Beat.
59.

SULLIVAN
Something I can’t do alone. You have
to listen to me now. OK? Or else
both of us are dead.
Michael nods, finally surrendering.
SULLIVAN 
I have to make Capone give up Connor.
(Michael follows)
Now, there’s one thing Chicago loves
more than anything - and that’s their
money. They’ve got it in banks all
over the state. We’re going to have
to find it and take it. Are you going
to help me?
MICHAEL
Yes
SULLIVAN
(beat)
Then I have to teach you something.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - DAY
Sullivan’s CAR sits on the side of a deserted farm road.
SULLIVAN
Now, you know what the clutch is?
MICHAEL
Sure I know what the clutch is.
SULLIVAN
What is the clutch?
MICHAEL
The clutch...it, uh...it clutches.
SULLIVAN
Right. It clutches. An which of
those pedals is the clutch?
Michael steps on the gas. The engine races.
SULLIVAN 
That’s the gas. Gas. I’ll show you.
There. Right there. See? Here’s the
clutch, and it does the clutching.
60.

INT./EXT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - DAY
The car moves forward two feet, and Michael tries to put it
in gear, and the car stalls, and the engine dies. The road
is quiet.
SULLIVAN
Let’s try again.
Sullivan starts the car for Michael.
MICHAEL
Release gas, clutch, shift gear, hit
gas.
SULLIVAN
Mmm-hmm.
Michael does the sequence, and the car moves.
MICHAEL
And shift!
The car stops and dies.
SULLIVAN
Can I make one suggestion?
MICHAEL
No. I’m doing this.
Sullivan looks at him. Amused.
CUT TO:
EXT. ANOTHER COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
They are zooming down the road. Really fast.
SULLIVAN
Forty-five miles an hour. That’s a
little fast.
Michael keeps speeding. He’s barely in control.
SULLIVAN 
Look out for the tractor, Michael.
A tractor trundles along up ahead.
61.

SULLIVAN 
Michael, look out for the tractor.
Coming up now.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - DAY (CONTINUOS) (MOVING)
They’re zooming up on the TRACTOR.
SULLIVAN
Watch out for the tractor...WATCH OUT
FOR THE...
SULLIVAN’s face is full of REAL FEAR.
SULLIVAN 
TRACTOR!
The CAR shrieks past the tractor. Michael, astonished and
relieved.
MICHAEL
We made it!
SULLIVAN
(dry)
Yes we did.
EXT. SAVINGS AND LOAN - ST. LOUIS - DAY
A BLACK, LEATHER DOCTOR’S BAG in hand, SULLIVAN enters a
BANK.
INT. SAVINGS AND LOAN - LOBBY -ST. LOUIS - DAY
FARMERS, HOUSEWIVES, BUSINESS PEOPLE stand in line.
SULLIVAN enters the lobby, scans it, he spots a tight,
officious-looking MAN moving behind the teller windows.
MCDOUGAL
No more excuses. I’ve told you once,
now I’m telling you again.
SULLIVAN
Excuse me, I’m looking for a Mr.
McDougal.
MCDOUGAL
Just one moment.
McDougal raises one finger to Sullivan, then returns to
lecturing his employee.
62.

INT. MCDOUGAL’S OFFICE - DAY
McDougal closes the door then smiles. Sullivan puts his bag
on the desk, sits down.
McDougal sits opposite him. He eyes the BLACK BAG.
MCDOUGAL
(obsequious)
Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I
wasn’t expecting another deposit until
the end of the month.
Sullivan undoes the clasp...reaches in... and pulls out a
COLT 45. McDougal’s grin vanishes.
SULLIVAN
Actually, I’m making a withdrawal.
And I want dirty money only.
Everything you’re holding for Capone
that’s off-the-books. Open the safe.
Beat. McDougla, terrified, hesitates.
MCDOUGAL
You’re insane. You know they’ll find
out who you are.
SULLIVAN
The name’s Sullivan.
(McDougal opens the safe)
Want me to spell it?
McDougal pulls out a safety deposit box of Capone’s money.
SULLIVAN 
Open the box.
MCDOUGAL
(opening the box)
They’ll kill you. They’re animals.
SULLIVAN
You don’t say? Put it in.
As McDougal fills the black bag, Sullivan slaps two bricks of
money on the desk.
SULLIVAN 
That’s for you. Call it a handling
charge.
(beat)
63.
(MORE)

Tell Chicago I took it. But if I read
about this in the papers, if I read
about the savings of innocent farmers
being wiped out by a heartless bank
robber...I won’t be happy.
(beat)
Good afternoon.
MCDOUGAL
You really trust me to nit say
anything?
SULLIVAN
Always trust a bank manager.
Sullivan exits
EXT. SAVINGS AND LOAN - ST. LOUIS - DAY
Sullivan steps out onto the curb. Waits.
The car pulls up very slowly. Michael is driving.
Sullivan looks through the open window at Michael’s nervous
face.
SULLIVAN
There’s no rush.
Sullivan gets in. They drive off.
INTO A MONTAGE OF VARIOUS EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR LOCATIONS
A series of FOUR BANKS over a number of WEEKS. We TRACK past
the windows of each: And in each, SULLIVAN is in the middle
of a robber. As we pass, we see the different stages of each
equable exchange: the revealing of the GUN; the manager
handing him the money; the money going into THE BAG; his
courteous exit, ect.
Now a series of three GETAWAYS. Seen from inside the banks
we TRACK past each exit: with each getaway MICHAEL’s driving
improvements: first, Sullivan waits at the curb and Michael
is NOT THERE; then he comes from the WRONG DIRECTION and hits
the curb; but on number there his getaway is PERFECT and the
car disappears out of sight.
INTERCUT:
MAGUIRE, sitting in a dark room, rolls a silver coin between
his fingers with great dexterity.
64.

SULLIVAN 

INTERCUT:
Sullivan and Michael in a BARN by the side of a DESERTED DIRT
ROAD.
They open cans, start painting the car a lavish MAROON.
The OPENED BACKSEAT of Sullivan’s car (where Michael stowed
away). Full of CASH. Michael slams the seat SHUT.
INT. SMALL RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A small family restaurant, two-thirds empty. An impoverished
dance floor. A SONG plays on the RADIO. TWO COUPLES dance.
Sullivan & Michael are finishing a meal. The waitress,
BETTY, is in he 30’s, attractive.
BETTY
Coffee?
SULLIVAN
Thank you.
She pours. A look between them, a connection.
BETTY
So...what brings you guys to the
middle of nowhere?
MICHAEL
We’re bank robbers.
Betty laughs.
SULLIVAN
We’re just passing through.
She smiles, leaves.
MICHAEL
When do I get my share of the money?
A beat.
SULLIVAN
How much d’you want?
Michael thinks, chances his luck with what he considers a
huge amount.
65.


MICHAEL
(decisive, he’s asking for
a lot)
Two hundred dollars.
SULLIVAN
Okay. Deal.
MICHAEL
(realizes)
Could I have had more?
SULLIVAN
You’ll never know.
INT. ROONEY’S STUDY - ROCK ISLAND - NIGHT
Rooney sits in his armchair, illuminated by the light from
the fire.
The phone rings. He stares at it, but does not pick it up.
INT. CONNOR’S ROOM - LEXINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT
Connor is at the other end of the line.
CONNOR
Come on. Come on.
He paces the floor, phone in hand.
INT. ROONEY’S STUDY - ROCK ISLAND - NIGHT
Roony sits, troubled.
The phone continues to ring. He doesn’t pick it up.
INT. CONNOR’S ROOM - LEXINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT
Connor waits. Still no answer.
He slams down the phone, flings a side table to the floor.
INT. NITTI’S OFFICE - DAY
NITTI is in his office, on the phone, outraged at what he’s
hearing.
NITTI
How much did they take?...HOW MUCH?...
Okay, answer me this, what are we
paying you for?-
66.


CONNOR (O.S.)
(muffled, overlapping)
Get... Get out of... Get out of my...
Get out of my way!
CONNOR bursts in, followed by HARRY.
CONNOR 
Where’s my father?
NITTI
What the fuck is this?
CONNOR
Why is no one talking to me?
NITTI
(into telephone)
Hold on.
CONNOR
I feel like a fucking prisoner.
NITTI
I told you. You are not a prisoner.
You are being protected. This is what
your father wants.
CONNOR
I can look after myself.
NITTI
No. You can’t. This is the point.
You’re a big baby who doesn’t know his
thumb from his dick.
CONNOR
Fuck you.
NITTI
(cool, calm)
Listen, sonny. The only reason you’re
still alive is because you’re John
Rooney’s son.
CONNOR
You’re being a little shortsighted,
Frank. My father’s an old man. I am
the future. So don’t you ever talk to
me that way again.
Connor storms out. Nitti shakes his head.
67.


NITTI
(to the phone)
Maguire? Do what you have to - FIND
THEM.
INT. YOUNG BANK MANAGER’S OFFICE - MORNING
A nervous YOUNG MAN MANAGER stands on the far side of his
desk, sweating. The black bag sits there between them.
YOUNG BANK MANAGER
I’m sorry, Mr. Sullivan. There,
there’s no money.
In a flash, the .45 is pointed at the Manager’s head.
YOUNG BANK MANAGER 
No! No...I can get you money. I
just...it won’t be Chicago’s. They
took it all out two day’s ago.
Sullivan sees the truth. Nods.
SULLIVAN
Who authorized it?
YOUNG BANK MANAGER
The accountant.
SULLIVAN
What’s his name?
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - PLUSH HOTEL - SMALL TOWN - MORNING
RANCE
This is Mr. Rance, in the Bridal
Suite...
RANCE is on the phone, ordering breakfast. He’s nervous and
edgy.
RANCE 
And before you proffer your phony
congratulations, there is no Mrs.
Rance residing with me and I’m all the
better for it. Now, listen carefully,
because I am in no mood.
We see his room. Clearly the BRIDAL SUITE. Chintz, crystal,
flowery wallpaper.
68.


RANCE 
I am going to say this only once- I
would like a Boiled Egg. And I want
it runny.
EXT. STREET - MORNING
Sullivan and Michael arrive in town. The MAROON CAR pulls
over to the curb. Michael is driving.
MICHAEL
Pa, can we sleep in a motel room
tonight instead of the car?
SULLIVAN
Yeah that would be nice.
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
The camera pans up from the road to reveal: MAGUIRE standing
at a window looking down into the street. He rolls a coin
between his fingers.
His POV: amongst the traffic of the morning... the maroon
car. He frowns at the car, watching closely. It’s the wrong
color.
A TEENAGE PROSTITUTE in the bed behind him is now waking up.
PROSTITUTE
(squinting at Maguire who
stands silhouetted by the
light)
How many more days you gonna want me,
Mister?
He ignores her, stars out the window.
PROSTITUTE 
Can’t we close the curtains, even for
a little while? I can't get no sleep
with all this light.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - MORNING
Michael and Sullivan look grubby and hardened.
SULLIVAN
Remember, if you see anything, you hit
the horn twice. And you don’t get out
of the car. No matter what.
69.

INT. BRIDAL SUITE - PLUSH HOTEL - MORNING
RANCE sits at a room service table, removing the top from his
boiled egg.
INT. BORDING HOUSE - MORNING
Maguire walks over, holds money out to the proustite and
teases her with it. She flinches a little and grabs the
money. Maguire waves at her.
MAGUIRE
Bye.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - MORNING
Sullivan loads his gun. Michael watches.
SULLIVAN
OK, you ready?
Michael takes a deep breath, gearing himself up.
MICHAEL
I’m ready.
Sullivan gets out of the car.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - PLUSH HOTEL - MORNING
RANCE sits at the room service table. He looks at his
breakfast contentedly. He lifts up a strip of bacon and it
REMAINS HORIZONTAL. He smiles.
He PLUNGES the bacon into the EGG... it SNAPS.
He removes his napkin, controls his temper.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - MORNING
Michael sits in the car.
REFLECTION IN THE WING MIRROR OF THE CAR: Michael watches
Sullivan enter the lobby of the hotel.
INT. LOBBY - PLUSH HOTEL - MORNING
Inside the lobby, Sullivan walks past the FRONT DESK. The
MANAGER is on the PHONE.
MANAGER
Yes, Sir, right away, Sir. Runny.
70.

Sullivan looks up to the key rack. There’s only one key
missing: BRIDAL SUITE.
He makes for the stairs.
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
The dressed prostitute leaves....
MAGUIRE HASN’T SEEN SULLIVAN get out of the car and cross the
road.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
RANCE is back at his breakfast table facing away from the
door.
He pours some coffee. There’s a KNOCK at the door.
RANCE is surprised at the hotel’s promptness.
RANCE
(to himself)
Hmm.
(over his shoulder)
It’s OPEN.
The door opens. Rance reaches for the EGG in its silver cup.
Without turning he addresses the enterer:
RANCE 
Top marks for speed. No marks for
COOKERY.
Rance wheels round exploding with indignation. He brandishes
the EGG.
RANCE 
WHAT may I ASK do you call THIS?
Sullivan pointing the COLT .45 in Rance’s face. Beat.
SULLIVAN
Put it down.
RANCE
Mister Sullivan.
SULLIVAN
Mister Rance.
71.


RANCE
How did you find me?
SULLIVAN
This is the best hotel in the area and
you are so very...particular.
RANCE
Yes indeed, Mister Sullivan, May I
ask you to lower your weapon?
Sullivan does so.
RANCE 
Thank you. Now what do you want?
SULLIVAN
Information.
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
The prostitute has left. Maguire returns to the window. He
looks across the road into Rance’s suite.
MAGUIRE’S POV: Rance is talking to someone. Maguire can’t
see who. He frowns and looks closer.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
RANCE
I can’t give you the files.
Sullivan cocks the trigger.
RANCE 
Alright! Alright! They’re in the
next room.
Rance moves into the bedroom. Sullivan watches him closely.
Rance surreptitiously looks over his shoulder towards the
boarding house: Where’s Maguire?
He turns and indicates a LARGE METAL TRUNK.
RANCE 
In here.
SULLIVAN
Bring it in.
72.


Sullivan moves to the window and begins to close the
curtains.
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
Maguire is still watching.
Suddenly... he sees Sullivan closing the curtains in the
bedroom across the street. He moves into action and starts
to get dressed.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
As Sullivan closes the curtains, RANCE is moving the large
trunk into the room from the bedroom.
RANCE
I won’t be able to see!
SULLIVAN
Move.
RANCE
(as he continues to push
the trunk)
What do you think that you are going
to accomplish by interfering with our
business, Mister Sullivan?
SULLIVAN
This has nothing to do with your
business.
RANCE
It’s all business, that’s what you
fail to grasp.
Sullivan closes the bedroom door. The sunlight through the
closed curtains casts an eerie glow.
RANCE 
And in business, you must have
something to trade. And you Mr.
Sullivan have nothing to trade.
Especially not for anyone as valuable
as Connor Rooney.
Beat. Rance has now pushed the trunk to the center of the
room.
73.


SULLIVAN
(suspicious)
I don’t understand.
Suddenly: A TICKER TAPE MACHINE GOES OFF. LOUD like a
machine gun.
Sullivan reacts.
RANCE
(calmly)
Opening bell on Wall Street.
The glass jar covering the MACHINE gleams in the shadow of an
alcove, a pile of yesterday’s tape strewn about.
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
Maguire is dressed now. He reaches down behind the bed and
picks up a bag. Inside... his PUMP ACTION RIFLE.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
The ticker tape machine rattles away.
SULLIVAN
Come on , open it.
Rance takes out a huge bunch of keys. Looks at them.
RANCE
Now which one is it?
Sullivan rolls his eyes.
INT. MAGUIRE’S BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
MAGUIRE is running down the stairs of the boarding house.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)
Michael sits in the driver’s seat. He’s alert, but getting
bored. And now beginning to be TEMPTED by his LONE RANGER
comic book, which sits on the passenger seat.
Michael finally gives in, reaches over to the comic book and
opens it.
Just as he does, Maguire passes right by the driver’s side
window of the car. Michael doesn’t see him.
74.

EXT. STREET - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)
MAGUIRE runs across the road towards the HOTEL ENTRANCE. A
CAR swerves to avoid him. A SCREECH of brakes.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR/EXT. STREET - MORNING
The noise makes Michael LOOK UP.
MICHAEL’S POV IN WING MIRROR: Maguire runs across the road.
CLOSE: The barrel of a gun is just visible to Michael beneath
Maguire’s coat.
Immediately, he hits the HORN two times.
Maguire looks back at the sound, but keeps running into the
hotel.
Michael hits the horn again.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
Inside the room, the TICKER TAPE MACHINE rattles away, making
the car horn INAUDIBLE.
Rance is still playing for time, waiting for Maguire.
Fiddling with the keys.
RANCE
No. That’s not it.
Rance tries another key.
INT. HOTEL STAIRS - MORNING
Maguire races up the STAIRS.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR- MORNING
Michael now holding the HORN down.
HIS POV: People on the street are beginning to stop and
stare.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
Rance continues to deliberately fumble with the keys. Now he
is frightened.
The TICKER TAPE is running down.
75.

RANCE
Tried that one already.
Rance drops the keys.
RANCE 
Better start over.
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING
MAGUIRE runs down a LONG CORRIDOR, his GUN out.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
Sullivan finally loses his patience and jams his gun into
Rance’s temple.
SULLIVAN
You’ve got one more try.
Rance ‘finds’ the key.
RANCE
Ah, here it is.
He unlocks the trunk.
Suddenly he flips the LID open. Sullivan looks inside: IT’S
EMPTY.
Suddenly... the TICKER TAPE runs out.
Sullivan hears the HORN, turns.
Rance dives inside the bedroom door, locking it behind him.
Sullivan realizes he’s being set up. He hits the floor
behind the metal trunk just as: Maguire’s pump action rifle
blows a HOLE in the doorway.
Maguire KICKS the door open.
He stands in the doorway and fire off FIVE SHOTS in quick
succession - TWO of the bullets BLOW HOLES through the wall
into the BEDROOM - ONE BLOWS A HOLE in the BEDROOM DOOR - TWO
slam against the METAL TRUNK LID which Sullivan holds,
protecting himself.
Maguire stops to reload.
MAGUIRE’S POV: He’s shooting up an EMPTY room.
76.


Sullivan springs up from behind the trunk and gets TWO SHOTS
in. They thud into the sofa. Maguire ducks behind an end
table. Reloads.
On the table: TWO GLASS LAMPS.
CLOSE: On Sullivan, breathing heavily, behind the open metal
trunk. Dents in the lid from the bullets.
He turns, looks. BULLET HOLES in the WALL and the DOOR to
the next room. STREAKS OF DAYLIGHT. A tense pause.
CLOSE: MAGUIRE, behind the sofa, preparing.
CLOSE: Sullivan, behind the trunk, preparing.
Then, suddenly, Maguire’s sits up, begins to shoot again.
Two more of Maguire’s bullets slam into the trunk.
Sullivan is thrown backwards onto the floor. As he falls, he
fires three more shots and BANG! One of his bullets hits a
glass lamp
Maguire’s face is SHOWERED WITH GLASS.
Sullivan fires a Maguire again. Click. Click. Empty
chambers.
Maguire is YELLING in pain.
He DROPS to his knees behind the sofa, holding his face.
Sullivan takes the opportunity. He sees the streaks of
daylight coming through the door to the next room - KICKS at
a panel in the door. The door gives.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - BEDROOM - MORNING
Sullivan runs into the bedroom. Rance lies dead on the bed -
hit by one of Maguire’s BULLETS which passed through the
wall.
Sullivan looks at the body as he passes, blood sprayed across
the wall... And there, next to the bed... the FILES.
Swiftly he moves to them - picks up the most prominent of
them - a SMALL BLACK STRONGBOX marked “CHIEF ACCOUNTS”.
He exits.
77.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING
Sullivan runs down the corridor.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE/EXT. STREET - MORNING
The light from the doorway hits Maguire. We can’t see his
face.
He stands up, unsteadily. He staggers over to the WINDOW and
pulls his REVOLVER out of his pocket.
SULLIVAN emerges from a side ALLEY and sprints across the
STREET. Michael throws the car into REVERSE and backs the
car towards him at speed.
CUT TO: MICHAEL’S POV from the CAR: Sullivan RUNS across the
street TOWARDS him. The bullets blow TWO holes in the roof
of the car.
SULLIVAN
(screams)
Go! Go!
Michael changes gear as fast as any professional and begins
to pull away. Maguire FIRES again.
As Sullivan gets in the passenger side he’s HIT on the
shoulder.
The car pulls away FAST.
Michael accelerates through the traffic of the morning.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - MORNING (CONTINUOUS) (MOVING)
Michael glances at his father, BLOOD seeps through the HAND
clutched to the WOUND. Sullivan sees the PANIC on Michael’s
face.
SULLIVAN
I’m OK! I’m OK! Just watch the road.
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING
MAGUIRE slumps down from the window. We’re behind him. He
holds his hand to his face. He looks at them.
They’re covered in blood.
78.
EXT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - DIRT ROAD - DAY
The CAR turns off a main road and onto a tiny DIRT ROAD.
INT. SULLIVAN’S CAR - DAY
MICHAEL
Pa?
SULLIVAN is losing consciousness.
MICHAEL 
Pa, are you okay?
(alarmed, no response)
Pa? Pa!
Michael spots some rickety BUILDINGS up ahead.
EXT. FIELD - DAY
A COUPLE in their late 50’s (BILL and VIRGINIA) are PLANTING
VEGETABLES in the field. Their clothes and the rough field
indicate their poverty.
They watch a CAR pulling in at the edge of the field.
A BOY gets out and SPRINTS towards them, waving his arms in
desperation.
MICHAEL
Help! Help us!
MONTAGE:
INT. ISOLATED ‘SHACK’ - NIGHT
CLOSE: Sullivan’s wounded shoulder. A HEATED KNIFE comes
into shot.
CLOSE: Michaels FACE as he watches BILL remove the bullet.
CLOSE: The bloody BULLET dropping into a tin cup.
LATER:
Sullivan lies in a makeshift bed, shivering with FEVER.
Night sweats.
Michael watches him, worried. A vigil.
79.
INT. ‘SHACK’ - THE NEXT NIGHT
Sullivan lies on his makeshift bead. His shoulder crudely
BANDAGED.
Michael feeds him SOUP and wipes his mouth with a napkin.
Sullivan is still feverish, only semi-conscious.
EXT. ‘SHACK’ - DAY
Sullivan sits outside with Virginia. He’s still bandaged but
look better, he drinks coffee. VIRGINIA is peeling potatoes.
They watch MICHAEL helping BILL in the field.
Michael is DIGGING with great energy while bill plants behind
him.
Sullivan’s CAR sits in the ramshackle BARN nearby.
VIRGINIA
When are you two heading out?
Sullivan understands the implication that they’ve outstayed
their welcome.
SULLIVAN
We’ve stayed long enough. Don’t want
to cause you any trouble.
VIRGINIA
No trouble so far.
Sullivan nods. Virginia smiles, looking to Michael in the
field.
VIRGINIA 
He’s a good worker.
Sullivan nods, enjoying Michael’s antics. Virginia continues
to peel. Sullivan turns to Virginia
SULLIVAN
You have any kids?
VIRGINIA
No, we met too late.
Pause. She nods towards Michael.
VIRGINIA 
He dotes on you.
80.

Sullivan looks at her, surprised.
VIRGINIA 
You don’t see it?
Sullivan shrugs. He looks at Michael who happens to LOOK UP
from his work.
His face: full of joy. He WAVES at his father, casually,
then gets back to digging.
On Sullivan: Suddenly moved beyond reason.
INT. ‘SHACK’ - NIGHT
Sullivan sit at the kitchen table. Lit by a hurricane oil
LAMP.
He pores over the DOCUMENTS and PAPERS Rance gave him.
He looks down pages of FIGURES, trying to understand. It’s
proving difficult.
Michael comes in, wearing night cloths. Sullivan’s pleased
to see him.
SULLIVAN
Hello..
MICHAEL
I had a bad dream.
SULLIVAN
You want to talk about it?
Michael shakes his head.
SULLIVAN 
Well...come on in. Take a seat, if
you want.
Michael sits at the table. Looks at the PAPERS.
MICHAEL
Math, huh?
SULLIVAN
(smiles)
Yeah. I always hated it.
MICHAEL
Me too.
81.


Beat. Sullivan looks at the boy, curious, scolding himself.
SULLIVAN
So what do you like?
MICHAEL
Huh?
SULLIVAN
What subject d’you like - did you
like? In school?
Pause. Michael has never been asked such a question by his
father.
MICHAEL
(shrugs)
Bible History, maybe.
SULLIVAN
(surprised)
Why?
MICHAEL
I like the stories.
Sullivan smiles.
MICHAEL 
Peter was good at math.
Sullivan looks at him.
SULLIVAN
Was he?
Michael nods. Pause.
MICHAEL
Did you like Peter more than me?
Pause
SULLIVAN
No. No, Michael. I loved you both
the same.
MICHAEL
But you were different with me.
82.


SULLIVAN
Was I?
(Michael nods)
Well, maybe that’s because Peter was
just such a sweet boy. You know? And
you...
Beat. Sullivan thinks.
SULLIVAN 
You were more like me. And... I
didn’t want you to be.
Beat.
SULLIVAN 
I didn’t mean to be different.
Michael takes this in.
MICHAEL
Okay
Beat.
MICHAEL 
Good night, Pa.
SULLIVAN
Good night.
Michael hugs Sullivan good-night. Sullivan responds.
INT. ‘SHACK’ - NIGHT (LATER)
Sullivan continues to read through the DOCUMENTS. He
discards some and then, at random, he pulls out a buff
colored FILE, quite thick, from another stack of papers.
Sullivan looks at it. Interested. Surprised.
CLOSE: The FILE: It says in type, ‘Mr. FINN MCGOVERN;
ACCOUNTS’.
Sullivan opens it. Flicks through: Letters, accounts,
dockets. Bank receipts in varying amounts, all made out to
‘CONNOR ROONEY’.
INT. ‘SHACK’ - EARLY MORNING
Sullivan, fully dressed, wakes the sleeping Michael.
83.


SULLIVAN
(upbeat)
Michael, wake up. Get your things.
Michael is bleary eyed.
SULLIVAN 
We’re leaving.
EXT. ‘SHACK’ - SAME DAY (LATER)
The CAR engine is running. Bill and Virginia wave good-bye
to Sullivan (who is driving) and Michael in the passenger
seat. Sullivan leans out the window:
SULLIVAN
We left you something.
Sullivan points to the BARN. The CAR rolls away down the
dirt road.
INT. BARN - DAY
Bill and Virginia in the Barn. In the center, Sullivan’s
BLACK BAG. They approach it. A NOTE in Michael’s
handwriting: ‘THANK YOU!’
IN THE BAG: Dollars. Hundreds and thousands of dollars.
Stacked in blocks.
They stare at the money. BILL turns to VIRGINIA, astounded.
EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY
WIDE SHOT: Sullivan’s CAR speeds down the open road.
EXT. ST. PETER’S CHURCH - DAY
A sunny morning. The bells of St. Peter’s announce Sunday
Mass.
CARS and PEOPLE throng the entrance.
INT. ST. PETER’S CHURCH - DAY
Inside, people receive communion at the altar rail. Rooney
is amongst them.
84.


The Mass is in Latin. Churchgoers already having received
the Eucharist, kneel in their pews in meditation. A choir
sings a meditation song.
CUT TO:
Rooney returns down the aisle. He slips into his pew,
kneels.
A man’s voice from the pew behind him speaks. It is
Sullivan.
SULLIVAN
Hello, John.
A pause. Rooney looks around.
ROONEY
You’re a smart man Michael.
SULLIVAN
I want to talk.
ROONEY
Here?
SULLIVAN
(standing)
Downstairs.
INT. STAIRS/CORRIDOR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
The MEN walk in silence.
They reach a SMALL DOOR. Sullivan opens it. Snaps on the
light.
Rooney nods to Sean and Jimmy to wait outside. Rooney and
Sullivan go intoINT. CRYPT/BASEMENT - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
The crypt stretches right underneath the church. No windows.
Bare bulbs. Religious detritus all around. Old pews,
kneelers, ect. A crucifix.
No chairs. They stand, looking at each other.
The sounds of the Mass continue above them.
Rooney’s face fill with emotion.
85.


ROONEY
I didn’t think I’d ever see you again.
Sullivan holds out the file.
SULLIVAN
Read this.
Rooney hesitates
SULLIVAN 
Connor’s been stealing from you for
years. He’s kept accounts open under
the names of dead men. Men like the
McGoverns. And I stood there and
helped him kill Finn to line his own
pockets. I thought I was working for
you. But I wasn’t
ROONEY
You think I’d give up my son?
SULLIVAN
He was betraying you.
ROONEY
I KNOW.
Pause. Sullivan in thrown. This is his last effort to get
through to the one man who could end this nightmare.
ROONEY 
Now listen to men. I tried to avoid
more bloodshed. You wouldn’t accept
that, so I did what was necessary.
But I’ve always loved you like a son.
Now I’m telling you. Leave. Before
it’s too late.
SULLIVAN
(tries again)
Think. Think. They’re protecting him
now - but when you’re gone, they’re
not going to need him anymore. This
ends with Connor dead no matter what.
ROONEY
That ay be. But you’re asking me to
give you the keys to his room, so you
can walk in, put a gun to his head,
and pull the trigger. I can’t do
that.
86.


SULLIVAN
He murdered Annie and Peter.
ROONEY
There are only murderers in this room!
Michael, open your eyes! This is the
life we chose - the life we lead.
There is only one guarantee. None of
us will see heaven.
SULLIVAN
Michael could.
ROONEY
Then do everything you can to see that
that happens. Leave. I’m begging
you. It’s the only way.
Sullivan, for the first time, considers this possibility.
SULLIVAN
And if I go?
ROONEY
Then I will mourn the son I lost.
INT. NONDESCRIPT HOTEL ROOM - ROCK ISLAND - NIGHT
It’s raining outside.
CLOSE: A closed black case.
SULLIVAN’S HANDS snap the catches open, and then lift the lid
of the case to reveal parts of a machine gun, lying in
compartments like a musical instrument.
We see SULLIVAN assembling the gun: he removes the parts,
piece by piece, quickly and efficiently.
MICHAEL comes in quietly.
Sullivan, unaware of his son’s presence, check each part of
the gun, then snaps them together.
He is intense, methodical, steeling himself.
Sullivan takes a canister of AMMUNITION and snaps it on to
the assembled weapon.
Sullivan turns... Michael sees the GUN.
87.


MICHAEL
What are you going to do?
Beat.
SULLIVAN
Just one last thing and then it’s
done.
Pause.
SULLIVAN 
(gently)
Go back to bed, Michael.
Michael looks at his father. There is nothing to say. He
leaves. Sullivan finishes putting together the gun.
INT. ADJOINING HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Sullivan writes Michael’s name on an envelope.
A single bed. Naked bulb.
Michael is asleep on the bed.
Sullivan puts the envelope on a bureau and looks at his boy.
After a moment, he turns, and exits the room.
On the bed, MICHAEL is awake - having pretended to sleep.
He sees the envelope. Picks it up. Realizes where his
father has gone...
CUT TO:
EXT/INT. SMALL ROCK ISLAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT
It’s closing time. Rooney and his SIX BODYGUARDS are there
last to leave. Chairs being put on tables, ect. Lights
going off.
They step outside into the rain. Sean holds an umbrella over
Rooney.
As they walk to the car, Rooney is flanked by his six men.
The car is parked further down the street at the curbside.
The streets are empty.
Rooney reaches the car and turns, knocking on the rain
streaked window. He can’t see through it clearly.
88.


He shakes the door handle, trying to open the door. The car
rocks...
JIMMY’S body falls forward onto the steering wheel.
Rooney freezes, fear in his eyes. He looks to his
bodyguards. They begin to draw their weapons.
From the dark, a burst of GUNFIRE.
One after another, the bodyguards go down - picked off with
brutal efficiency.
Rooney simply stands there, head bent, waiting for it to be
him.
The gunfire echoes through the empty streets. Then silence.
All of Rooney’s men are dead. Rooney stands alone. He
raises his head.
Over Rooney’s shoulder; Behind him, far off down the road,
SULLIVAN. He steps out of the darkness and walks toward him.
Sullivan stops a short distance from Rooney.
Rooney turns around.
Sullivan levels the gun.
A long beat. They look at each other.
ROONEY
I’m glad it’s you.
He SHOOTS him.
WIDE SHOT: Only one figure stands in the empty street.
CLOSE: Sullivan’s face. Destroyed. He looks up.
One by one, unbeknownst to Sullivan, lights have come on in
the street. People are drawn to the windows above him.
MEN and WOMEN, staring in silence from warmly lit interiors.
POV FROM A HIGH WINDOW: Sullivan , seeming so small from up
high, standing alone int the rain.
Slowly, Sullivan turns and walks into the darkness.
WIDE SHOT: The empty streets, and the rain.
89.

INT. NITTI’S OFFICE - LEXINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT
Nitti is alone in his office, on the phone.
He listens.
NITTI
I understand. But Al wants your
assurance that after that... it’s
over.
Nitti gets his assurance.
NITTI 
The Lexington Hotel. Room 1432.
He hangs up. Sighs. Reaches over for a file. Begins to
work.
WIDE SHOT: Nitti, alone in his office, at the center of it
all.
EXT. LEXINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT
The wind blows paper across the deserted street in front of
the Lexington Hotel. A solitary figure walks into shot.
It’s Sullivan. He enters the hotel.
INT. LEXINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT
Sullivan crosses the deserted lobby of the Lexington.
CLOSE: Sullivan. Focused.
He approaches MARCO, who stands by the elevators.
But this time nothing is said. Marco simply presses the
elevator button for him and steps aside.
Sullivan walks into the elevator. The doors close.
INT. LEXINGTON - UPPER CORRIDOR/INT. CONNOR’S ROOM - NIGHT
Sullivan exits the elevators. We follow him down the
corridor.
He reaches Connor’s room. Knocks. The door opens. It’s
HARRY. He sees it’s Sullivan, and steps aside.
Sullivan walks into the suite.
Sullivan looks to Harry - Harry’s eyes flick to the bathroom.
90.

Sullivan walks to the bathroom. Opens the door.
Inside, the room is lit bright white. There is steam form
the bath, though WE CAN’T SEE who’s in it.
From outside the room, we see Sullivan raise his gun. He
fires three shots at the unseen figure in the bath. Fast.
Brutal. Efficient.
Then he turns, and walks.
The MIRRORED BATHROOM DOOR swings slowly closed. As it
closes it reflects the scene on the other side of the door.
IT’S CONNOR. He lies in his bath, BLOOD splattered across
the WHITE WALLS.
INT. LEXINGTON HOTEL - UPPER CORRIDOR - NIGHT
We follow Sullivan down the corridor.
Then... we stop. He walks away from us along the long
corridor.
INT. NONDESCRIPT HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
Michael is sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting for his
father. He hears footsteps. Closes his eyes in silent
prayer.
The door swings open.
Sullivan enters. They embrace.
Sullivan’s face. Filled with emotion.
EXT. ROAD TO PERDITION - DAY
SULLIVAN drives. The day is clear and blue, like the first
day of Spring.
Michael sticks his head out the window, lets the wind roar
over him, smiling.
EXT. DIRT TRAIL - DAY
Their car pulls up and stops.
EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
Sullivan and Michael come down through the woods and out onto
a desolate, beautiful beach on the lake front. A light
breeze blows in off the lake. Magic hour.
91.


They walk down the beach, easy with each other.
Father and son look over the beach. A pause.
They see the house this distance.
MICHAEL
Is that the house?
SULLIVAN
That’s it.
A dog runs out to greet them.
MICHAEL
Hey! I knew there was a dog.
Michael takes off to meet up with the dog, running down the
beach.
Sullivan doesn’t move. He just watches his son. Smiles.
EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - PERDITION - DAY
Sullivan approaches the house and opens the screen door,
enters.
INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - HALL - DAY
SULLIVAN moves down the hall. At the end is a large sunlit
room.
SULLIVAN
Sarah? It’s me, Mike. We’re here.
Through the window, Sullivan watches Michael and the dog on
the beach.
EXT. BEACH - DAY
The DOG leaps up at Michael who catches its paws.
INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - ROOM -DAY
SULLIVAN enters the room. Empty. He looks out the window to
the lake, and watches Michael playing with the dog. Michael
waves at his father. Finally, a moment of peace...and
happiness. Then...
BANG!
MAGUIRE puts two BULLETS in SULLIVAN’S chest.
92.


SULLIVAN goes down, leaving a smear of BLOOD against the wall
and window.
MAGUIRE studies him. His face is a shocking sight. A MASS
OF SCARS
MAGUIRE mover nearer, puts his GUN on the TABLE.
As Maguire turns away, SULLIVAN tries to lift his hand to his
holster, but hasn’t got the strength.
MAGUIRE takes his CAMERA out and starts to FOCUS.
MAGUIRE
(whisper)
Smile.
MAGUIRE’S POV: THROUGH THE LENS: Sullivan’s lying on the
floor, bleeding to death, upside down.
Maguire takes his SHOT. A hard, bright FLASH.
There’s a CREAK. MAGUIRE’s head SNAPS UP away from the
CAMERA
MAGUIRE’S POV: The BARREL of his OWN GUN pointing at him from
three yards.
MICHAEL holding the gun, both hands. His face DETERMINED,
certain.
CLOSE: The gun shaking, slightly.
Maguire glances at Sullivan who is staring at the boy.
Maguire looks back at Michael who cocks the trigger:
MAGUIRE 
Give me the gun.
(beat)
Michael?
Maguire’s hands are up.
MAGUIRE 
Don’t you do this...
The GUN faces him.
Michael flicks his eyes to Sullivan: ‘Help me’.
93.


Sullivan tries to respond with his eyes... but Michael can’t
understand.
MAGUIRE 
Come on.
MICHAEL’S POV: Maguire stares at him.
MAGUIRE 
Give me the gun.
On MICHAEL: SLOW PUSH IN. HIS FACE. Steeling himself, eyes
wide open, staring with determination... then fear... then
desperation...
SOUND: GUNSHOT.
STILL ON MICHAEL’S FACE: shocked, terrified.
CUT BACK TO REVEAL: Maguire’s body lies DEAD in the center of
the room.
Michael looks at his father. SULLIVAN’S GUN IS STILL RAISED.
MICHAEL
I couldn’t do it...
On Sullivan: traces of a SMILE. The end of a long journey.
SULLIVAN
(whispers)
I know.
MICHAEL
Pa?
SULLIVAN
I’m sorry. Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
MICHAEL
Pa! Pa!
MICHAEL 
I saw then that my father’s only fear
was that his son would follow the same
road. And that was the last time I
ever held a gun.
MICHAEL 
People always thought I grew up on a
farm. And I guess in a way, I did.
MICHAEL  
But I lived a lifetime before that, in
those six weeks on the road, in the
winter of nineteen thirty-one.
When people ask me if Michael Sullivan
was a good man, or if there was just
no good in him at all, I always give
the same answer. I just tell them...
he was my father.
