MICHAEL 
There are many stories about Michael
Sullivan. Some say he was a decent
man. Some say there was no good in
him at all. But I once spent six
weeks on the road with him in the
winter of 1931.
MICHAEL  
This is our story.
Thank you, sir. Much obliged to you.
Man dies in factory accident! Get
your paper here!
Hot off the press, only five cents!
Thanks, Mister Miller
ANNIE
I’ll help you with it later....
ANNIE 
You go fetch your father.
MICHAEL
Pa?
SULLIVAN
Mm-hm.
MICHAEL
Dinner’s ready.
SULLIVAN
Thank you.
MICHAEL
Bless us oh Lord for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive through
the bounty of Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
SULLIVAN
Michael.
MICHAEL
Sir?
SULLIVAN
It’s a wake. So I don’t wanna see
those dice.
MICHAEL
No, sir.
PETER
I don’t want to go.
ANNIE
It’s all right, honey. Come on.
PETER
No. I’m scared.
SULLIVAN
Ice helps preserve the body.
ROONEY
Who’s got a hug for a lonely old man?
Now which is which? Don’t help me!
Peter. And... Michael.
Annie. Mike. Good to see you.
Did you bring the necessary?
PETER
Yes.
ROONEY
If you’ll excuse me, I have some
urgent business with these young
gentleman.
MICHAEL
Yeah!
PETER
Winner! Winner!
ROONEY
Call the cops. I know hustlers when I
see ‘em.
MICHAEL
No hustle ol’ timer!
PETER
Pay the man!
ROONEY
Upstairs. Jacket pocket in my study.
Before I change my mind
CONNOR
Hello.
MICHAEL
Hello...
CONNOR
Remind me, which little Sullivan are
you?
MICHAEL
Michael, Sir.
CONNOR
Sir? You don’t have to call me sir.
I’m not your Pa.
MICHAEL
No, Mr. Rooney
CONNOR
Call me Connor. No, call me Uncle
Connor.
What do you want?
MICHAEL
Mister Rooney sent me to get his
jacket.
CONNOR
Why don’t you come back later, huh?
I’m busy.
MICHAEL
Yes... Sir.
ROONEY
Hello! Hello! I want to welcome all
of you to my home. It’s good to have
so many friends in this house again.
Since Mary died, it’s - well - it’s
just been me and my boy, rattling
around in these rooms...
I had this speech prepared, but it
would be dishonest of me to say that I
knew Danny well. But lose one of us,
it hurts us all.
I’ll tell you what I do remember
though. And Finn will remember this
too. And that’s... Danny on the high
school football team. A championship
game: down six points, ten seconds
left to play, four yards to go. Danny
tackles his own quarterback.
Mistakes. You know, we all make’em
God knows.
ROONEY 
Let’s drink to Danny’s honor. Let’s
wake him to God.
And hope he gets to heaven at least an
hour before the Devil finds out he’s
dead.
To Danny!
And now, our good friend, Finn
McGovern, will say a few words.
Words, I’ll wager, that have a little
more poetry than mine.
MCGOVERN
Thank you, John. My brother Danny
wasn’t wise, nor was he gentle. And
with a skinfull of liquor in him... he
was a pain in the ass.
Bute he was loyal. And brave. And he
never told a lie.
He’d’ve enjoyed this party. Me and
the family, we want to say thank you
to our generous host. Where would
this town be without Mr. John Rooney.
God love you.
I’ve worked for you many years now
John, nearly half my life... and we’ve
never had a disagreement... but...
I’ve come to realize that you rule
this town as God rules the earth...
you give and take away.
I’m going to bury my brother, then I’m
going to deal with you.
SULLIVAN
Sure, Finn, sure. You’ll take care of
all of us once you get a good night’s
sleep.
ROONEY
Is he all right?
CONNOR
Yeah, he’s fine. Just too much to
drink. I’ll talk to him.
ROONEY
Take Mike with you.
CONNOR
No, Pa - I’ll be fine.
ROONEY
Take Mike with you... And just talk.
PETER
Why are you always smiling?
CONNOR
‘Cause it’s all so fuckin’ hysterical.
PETER
Michael?
MICHAEL
What?
PETER
I had a nightmare. It was about Mr.
Rooney’s house.
MICHAEL
It’s just a house. A big house. Go
back to sleep.
PETER
Is Mr. Rooney rich like the Babe?
MICHAEL
Richer.
PETER
Are we rich?
MICHAEL
No stupid.
PETER
What’s Papa’s job?
MICHAEL
He works for Mr. Rooney.
PETER
Why?
MICHAEL
Well, Papa didn’t have a father. So,
Mr. Rooney looked after him.
PETER
I know that. But what’s his job?
MICHAEL
He goes on missions for Mr. Rooney...
they’re very dangerous, that’s why he
brings his gun...
Sometimes even the President sends him
on missions...because Papa was a war
hero and all.
PETER
You’re just making that up.
MICHAEL
I am not!
PETER
It’s all so fuckin’ hysterical.
SULLIVAN
Peter, I can’t come to your concert
tonight. I’m working.
PETER
Working at what?
ANNIE
Putting food on your plate, young man.
SULLIVAN
All right, boys. Come on. Clear the
plates.
You’re a good lad.
CONNOR
You want a shot?
SULLIVAN
We’re just talking to him. Right?
CONNOR
Sure.
...don’t get me wrong, Finn. I feel
for you. I do. But you can’t let a
thing like that give you cause to go
mouthing off. You and my dad go back
many years. He’s a just man.
So what do you say?
SULLIVAN
Come on now, Finn. Let’s make this
easy.
CONNOR
We can’t hear you!
MCGOVERN
All right.
CONNOR
Good. Thank you. And I am sorry.
I’m sorry for you loss. I’m sorry for
this misunderstanding...and I’m sorry
your brother was such a fuckin’ liar.
MCGOVERN
My brother was not a liar.
CONNOR
Excuse me?
MCGOVERN
To protect my family, and keep my job,
I’ll stay quiet. But don’t think I
don’t know something’s going on. And
don’t think I won’t find out what it
is.
CONNOR
Whoa...
MCGOVERN
Easy. We’re just talking.
You tell your father, my brother never
stole from him. I’ve checked the
books, he never sold no booze to noone. Every single barrel is accounted
for.
Anyway if he’d’a sold it, where’s the
money?
CONNOR
Fuck should I know? D’you check his
mattress?
MCGOVERN
Maybe you should check yours.
CONNOR
Look, there’s something immoral here,
don’t you think so Mike? My beloved
father throws your undeserving little
brother the wake of his life and this
is your thank you? What a hideous
world this is.
MCGOVERN
You think you’re so smart?! You think
we don’t know? I mean, you’ve been
spending so much time in Chicago...
SULLIVAN
What was that?
CONNOR
We’re outta here.
SULLIVAN
Jesus Christ, Conor! What the hell
are you thinking.
CONNOR
There.
SULLIVAN
Oh, Jesus.
Michael
Are you hurt?
You saw everything?
Jesus.
You are not to speak of this to
anyone. You understand? Not anyone!
CONNOR
Who’s this?
Is this one of yours?
SULLIVAN
He must’ve been hiding in the car.
CONNOR
Can he keep a secret?
SULLIVAN
He’s my son.
CONNOR
Good enough for me. You take him
home. I think I’ll walk.
Perfect night for a stroll
MICHAEL
Does Mama know?
SULLIVAN
You mother knows I love Mr. Rooney.
When we had nothing, he gave us a
home. A life. And we owe him. Do
you understand?
Do you understand?
MICHAEL
Yes.
SULLIVAN
Come on inside.
ANNIE
Boys, clear you plates, please.
MICHAEL
I’ll do it later.
ANNIE
It’s time for school now, just
MICHAEL
It’s only a plate.
ROONEY
Peter!
ANNIE
What’s he doing here?
SULLIVAN
Michael was hiding in the car when I
wen out last night.
ANNIE
Oh Jesus, Mike
SULLIVAN
I’ve spoken to him. It won’t happen
again.
ROONEY
Just the feller!
Our secret, right?
ROONEY 
I’m talking about the dice.
ROONEY 
A man of honor always pays his
debts...
...and keeps his word.
MICHAEL
I’m gonna be late for school.
ROONEY
How is Michael? Is he OK?
SULLIVAN
I’ve spoken to him. He understands.
ROONEY
That’s tough, seeing that for the
first time.
ROONEY 
Well--you turned out.
You can’t protect him forever. If it
wasn’t this, it’d be something else.
Natural law. Sons are put on this
earth to trouble their fathers.
Sullivan loves this man.
KELLY
John also made it clear that Finn
McGovern’s operation will be divided
up locally among two territories that
John will select personally. I’d like
to take this moment to thank our
friend Mister Rance, for interrupting
a busy travel schedule to pay us a
visit.
RANCE
Thank you, Jack.
KELLY
Mister Rance met with John and me
earlier to make another bid for our
involvement in the unions.
ROONEY
And I told Mister Rance what I told
him before. What men do after work is
what made us all rich. No need to
screw ‘em at work as well.
KELLY
Is there any other business?
ROONEY
Yes
ROONEY 
Connor, is there something you would
like to say about last night?
CONNOR
I’d like to apologize for what
happened. Especially toy you, Pa - two
wakes in a month, what can I say?
ROONEY
We lost a good man last night. You
think it’s funny? Try again...
CONNOR
I’d like to apologize for--
ROONEY
You would like to apologize? TRY
AGAIN!
CONNOR
Gentlemen. My apologies.
KELLY
Is everyone clear about bit-borrowers?
There’s been far too many debts
outstanding.
ROONEY
Mike?
SULLIVAN
Just give me their names. Tell me who
to visit.
ROONEY
Thank you gentlemen.
Come upstairs.
CONNOR
Mike!
Dad forgot to give you this. Reminder
for Tony Calvino.
He’s light again.
SULLIVAN
You coming?
CONNOR
Nah.
I’m under house arrest for a while.
Look, I’m sorry about last night. I
am. I was... you know.
SULLIVAN
Alright.
FRANK
Help you sir, or just lookin’?
SULLIVAN
Here to see Tony Calvino.
FRANK
Yeah, and who are you?
SULLIVAN
Mike Sullivan
FRANK
Oh. Yes sir.
SULLIVAN
You gonna frisk me?
FRANK
Should I?
SULLIVAN
It’s a good idea.
That’s the only one.
FRANK
I mean, I’m not a grown man and this
place is getting to me. Every night
there’s trouble. Nobody’s got no
dough, but all the world’s here
wasting it. Always money for frills
and twists, never money for food.
Sometimes I despair of the species you
know?
WOMAN
Number Twelve in the beauty parlor.
Who’s the lucky face?
FRANK
I’m not from here originally. Things
being what they are, jobs ain’t
hanging off of trees.
I’m a boxer by trade - nine
consecutive titles. A record for
South Orange. I’d make a pretty good
bodyguard, I think.
What I’m saying... is Mr. Rooney
looking for anyone...anyone like me,
for example? Any chance you might ask
him?
SULLIVAN
Sure.
FRANK
Oh, thank you, Mr. Sullivan. Thank
you very much. I appreciate it.
Mr. Calvino...Mike Sullivan’s here.
CALVINO
Aaah, shit.
FRANK
He wants to see you.
CALVINO
Aaah, shit. Is he packing?
FRANK
Not any more.
CALVINO
All right. Show him in. Hey...you
stick around, OK?
Hey, how the hell are you? Things
good with the old man?
SULLIVAN
Yeah.
CALVINO
What brings you here? Don’t imagine
it’s the pussy.
SULLIVAN
I have a letter for you from Mr.
Rooney.
CALVINO
Am I behind again?
CALVINO 
Am I in trouble?
SULLIVAN
I don’t know.
SULLIVAN 
Michael
CONNOR
Pa? I-I, I’m sorry.
Well, he... would’ve talked. The kid
would’ve talked.
ROONEY
Stupid!
CONNOR
The kid would’ve talked. I’m sorry.
ROONEY
Goddamn YOU!
ROONEY 
Goddamn YOU...I CURSE THE FUCKIN’ DAY
You WERE BORN! I CURSE IT! YOU!
ROONEY 
Oh, Lord. Oh, no.
ROONEY 
Oh, Lord. God help us. God help us.
MICHAEL
Don’t go, Pa. Don’t go.
SULLIVAN
Michael, tomorrow when they find out
we’re gone, they’re gonna come after
us. I have to protect you now.
MICHAEL
Please, Pa.
SULLIVAN
All right, here. Take this.
MICHAEL
No.
SULLIVAN
Michael, take it.
MICHAEL
Don’t want it. I don’t want it, Pa!
SULLIVAN
Boy, take it!
You got six shots.
If I’m not back in half and hour, you
go see Reverent Lynch at First
Methodist and you tell him what
happened. Do not go to Father
Callaway.
Don’t have any business with you, Mr.
Kelly.
KELLY
But I have business with you, Mike.
SULLIVAN
Go ahead.
SULLIVAN 
What is that?
KELLY
Twenty-five thousand dollars. Mr.
Rooney wants you to know there’s more
if you want it.
KELLY 
You have friends in Ireland, Mike.
Why don’t you take Peter and leave.
SULLIVAN
I can’t take Peter. He’s dead.
SULLIVAN 
Where’s Connor?
KELLY
He’s in hiding.
SULLIVAN
Where?
KELLY
You know I can’t tell you that, Mike.
You think sticking a gun to my head is
going to make a difference to me? If
I tell you, I’m a dead man anyway. We
both are.
KELLY 
Think Mike - don’t be stupid.
I’m just a messenger.
SULLIVAN
Then give Mr. Rooney a message for me.
KELLY
What is it?
SULLIVAN
Give me the gun.
MICHAEL
Where are we going?
SULLIVAN
T Chicago. There’s a man there who
runs things. I’ve done some work for
him.
We have to find out where he stands.
Try to get some sleep.
I want you to wait for me here.
MICHAEL
Sure.
SULLIVAN
I won’t be long. You’ll be all right?
MICHAEL
Yeah, I’ll be all right.
SULLIVAN
You’re a good boy.
HARRY
Hello, Mike.
SULLIVAN
Hello, fellas.
HARRY
It’s nice to see you. We heard what
happened. How you holding up?
SULLIVAN
I need to talk to Mr. Nitti.
HARRY
He’s awful busy.
SULLIVAN
I can wait.
HARRY
OK. Take the man to the top.
NITTI
Sorry to keep you waiting so long,
Mike.
We all just heard what happened.
Jesus, I’m sorry.
SULLIVAN
Thank you for seeing me Mr. Nitti.
NITTI
Come on, sit down. Would you like
some coffee, or -
SULLIVAN
No.
NITTI
You sure?
SULLIVAN
Yes. Thank you.
NITTI
So, what can I do for you, Mike?
SULLIVAN
I would like to work for you.
NITTI
Well, that’s very interesting.
SULLIVAN
And in return, I’d like you to turn a
blind eye to...what I have to do.
NITTI
And what is that?
SULLIVAN
Kill the man who murdered my family.
NITTI
Is one more body going to make a
difference?
SULLIVAN
This is a good proposal Mr. Nitti. I
will work only for you...and you know
I can do a good job.
NITTI
I respect you, Mike, I do. And we
would like nothing more than to have
you come and work for us. But not
like this. What you’re asking me is
impossible.
SULLIVAN
Is it?
NITTI
Let me explain something to you that
maybe you haven’t realized. All
these years, you’ve been living under
the protection of people who care
about you. And those same people are
protecting you now. Including me. So
open that door, you’re walking through
it alone. And all that loyalty, and
all that trust will no longer exist
for you... And Mike - you won’t make
it. Not on your own. Not with a
little boy.
SULLIVAN
You’re protecting him already?
NITTI
We’re protecting our interests.
SULLIVAN
I drove through the night to see you.
NITTI
I appreciate that, and now I suggest
you drive yourself back. Go home,
Mike. Go home and bury your wife and
child. With our blessing.
SULLIVAN
It won’t be that simple.
NITTI
You heard?
CONNOR
Dad, listen to me. He’s in the
building. You can end this now.
You’ve got to take him now.
ROONEY
Connor. Get upstairs.
ROONEY 
God help me.
What do I do
NITTI
You think objectively. And you make
your choice. What would you do if
Sullivan were just... some guy?
ROONEY
God help me.
ROONEY 
Make it quick.
NITTI
And the kid?
ROONEY
Oh, Christ. No.
NITTI
And one day, the kid becomes a man.
Think he won’t remember?
ROONEY
I said, not the kid.
NITTI
Alright. I know who to call.
NITTI 
There’s a guy who’s done some work for
us in the past... He’s gifted.
MAGUIRE
Excuse me, ma’am. Press! Press!
MURDERER
He was raping my wife, he fucking
raped my wife.
POLICE MAN
Come on! Come on! You’re treading on
the evidence here.
MAGUIRE
Two minutes.
POLICE MAN
You got it, Mr. Maguire.
MAGUIRE
Harlem Maguire... Good-evening, Mr.
Nitti.
Uh huh...sixteen hundred.
Sixteen hundred dollars is my rate,
Mr. Nitti. And what I make on the
photographs is mine.
No, never met him, but I know his
work.
He traveling alone? How old?
What do I do with the kid? Uh huh...
will do. Thank you.
SULLIVAN
You remember your Aunt Sarah? Your
mom’s sister? She lives in Perdition.
She’ll take you in.
MICHAEL
Where is that?
SULLIVAN
Right by the lake. We went there
once, all of us, when you were four,
maybe five. It’s beautiful. You
remember?
MICHAEL
The place with the dog.
SULLIVAN
Sarah?
SARAH
Mike. Thank God...
SULLIVAN
I want you to know we’re okay.
SARAH
Where are you?
SULLIVAN
We’re on our way to your place, if
that’s all right.
SARAH
Of course. I’ll be back there in two
days. How’s Michael?
SULLIVAN
He’s alright.
How was it?
SARAH
Oh, Mike...
Hello...?
SULLIVAN
We’ll see you soon.
MAGUIRE
Hello, operator. I was just cut off,
could you reconnect me?
SULLIVAN
You hungry?
MICHAEL
No.
SULLIVAN
Might not be another diner for a
while. You should have something to
eat.
MICHAEL
I’m not hungry. I just wanna read.
MAGUIRE
Slow night, huh?
RUBY
You kiddin’? This is busy! What can I
get you?
MAGUIRE
You got a special?
RUBY
Everything’s special.
MAGUIRE
Is that so?
RUBY
Everything ‘cept the food.
MAGUIRE
“Everything ‘cept the food!” You
oughtta be on the stage
RUBY
Don’t I know it.
MAGUIRE
Gimme some of that honey dip fired
chicken, and a black coffee.
RUBY
Duck soup.
MAGUIRE
Don’t mind me, sir.
SULLIVAN
Huh?
MAGUIRE
It’s a free country - Used to be,
anyhow!
MAGUIRE 
No thank you, sir.
SULLIVAN
Is that your profession or your
pleasure.
MAGUIRE
Both I guess. To be paid to do what
you love, ain’t that the dream.
SULLIVAN
I guess so.
MAGUIRE
Yourself?
SULLIVAN
I’m a salesman. Machine parts.
MAGUIRE
Machine parts? That’s wonderful!
SULLIVAN
I assure you, it is not. So who do
you work for?
MAGUIRE
Can you keep a secret?
I’m “Press”.
SULLIVAN
Which paper?
MAGUIRE
All over. I’m something of a rarity.
SULLIVAN
How’s that?
MAGUIRE
I shoot the dead.
Dead bodies, that is. I don’t kill
‘em!
SULLIVAN
Should hope not.
MAGUIRE
Always fascinated me...the look of
‘em, you know? You ever seen one?
Sullivan nods.
MAGUIRE 
Sorry for you. Terrible thing. But
it sure makes you feel alive, don’t
it?
SULLIVAN
I’ll drink to that.
MAGUIRE
Stuff makes you sweat, huh?
SULLIVAN
Piss, too.
SULLIVAN 
Excuse me, ma’am. Can you help me out
here?
RUBY
Just through there.
MAGUIRE
Hey! Look out there!
SULLIVAN
Whoah.
COP
Thanks, Ruby.
RUBY
Good night.
COP
Forgot to leave a tip...
SULLIVAN
Get DOWN!
MICHAEL
Why? What’s going on--?
SULLIVAN
Get DOWN!
COP
HEY, what do you think you’re doing--
SULLIVAN 
Get out of the car!
When I say get down, you get down!
You don’t ask questions! When I say
we’re stopping to eat, you stay with
me!
You listen to me from now on, or you
start taking care of yourself.
MICHAEL
I can take care of myself fine! You
never wanted me along anyway! You
think it’s my fault this happened!
SULLIVAN
Stop it Michael! IT WAS NOT YOUR
FAULT! None of this is your fault!
MICHAEL
Just take me to Aunt Sarah’s
SULLIVAN
I can’t take you there. Not now.
MICHAEL
Why?
SULLIVAN
He knows that’s where we’re going.
MICHAEL
So what are you gonna do?
SULLIVAN
Something I can’t do alone. You have
to listen to me now. OK? Or else
both of us are dead.
SULLIVAN 
I have to make Capone give up Connor.
Now, there’s one thing Chicago loves
more than anything - and that’s their
money. They’ve got it in banks all
over the state. We’re going to have
to find it and take it. Are you going
to help me?
MICHAEL
Yes
SULLIVAN
Then I have to teach you something.
Now, you know what the clutch is?
MICHAEL
Sure I know what the clutch is.
SULLIVAN
What is the clutch?
MICHAEL
The clutch...it, uh...it clutches.
SULLIVAN
Right. It clutches. An which of
those pedals is the clutch?
That’s the gas. Gas. I’ll show you.
There. Right there. See? Here’s the
clutch, and it does the clutching.
Let’s try again.
MICHAEL
Release gas, clutch, shift gear, hit
gas.
SULLIVAN
Mmm-hmm.
MICHAEL
And shift!
SULLIVAN
Can I make one suggestion?
MICHAEL
No. I’m doing this.
SULLIVAN
Forty-five miles an hour. That’s a
little fast.
Look out for the tractor, Michael.
A tractor trundles along up ahead.
Michael, look out for the tractor.
Coming up now.
Watch out for the tractor...WATCH OUT
for the...
TractOR!
MICHAEL
We made it!
SULLIVAN
Yes we did.
MCDOUGAL
No more excuses. I’ve told you once,
now I’m telling you again.
SULLIVAN
Excuse me, I’m looking for a Mr.
McDougal.
MCDOUGAL
Just one moment.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I
wasn’t expecting another deposit until
the end of the month.
SULLIVAN
Actually, I’m making a withdrawal.
And I want dirty money only.
Everything you’re holding for Capone
that’s off-the-books. Open the safe.
MCDOUGAL
You’re insane. You know they’ll find
out who you are.
SULLIVAN
The name’s Sullivan.
Want me to spell it?
SULLIVAN 
Open the box.
MCDOUGAL
They’ll kill you. They’re animals.
SULLIVAN
You don’t say? Put it in.
SULLIVAN 
That’s for you. Call it a handling
charge.
Tell Chicago I took it. But if I read
about this in the papers, if I read
about the savings of innocent farmers
being wiped out by a heartless bank
robber...I won’t be happy.
Good afternoon.
MCDOUGAL
You really trust me to nit say
anything?
SULLIVAN
Always trust a bank manager.
There’s no rush.
BETTY
Coffee?
SULLIVAN
Thank you.
BETTY
So...what brings you guys to the
middle of nowhere?
MICHAEL
We’re bank robbers.
SULLIVAN
We’re just passing through.
MICHAEL
When do I get my share of the money?
SULLIVAN
How much d’you want?
MICHAEL
Two hundred dollars.
SULLIVAN
Okay. Deal.
MICHAEL
Could I have had more?
SULLIVAN
You’ll never know.
CONNOR
Come on. Come on.
NITTI
How much did they take?...HOW MUCH?...
Okay, answer me this, what are we
paying you for?-
CONNOR
Get... Get out of... Get out of my...
Get out of my way!
CONNOR 
Where’s my father?
NITTI
What the fuck is this?
CONNOR
Why is no one talking to me?
NITTI
Hold on.
CONNOR
I feel like a fucking prisoner.
NITTI
I told you. You are not a prisoner.
You are being protected. This is what
your father wants.
CONNOR
I can look after myself.
NITTI
No. You can’t. This is the point.
You’re a big baby who doesn’t know his
thumb from his dick.
CONNOR
Fuck you.
NITTI
Listen, sonny. The only reason you’re
still alive is because you’re John
Rooney’s son.
CONNOR
You’re being a little shortsighted,
Frank. My father’s an old man. I am
the future. So don’t you ever talk to
me that way again.
NITTI
Maguire? Do what you have to - FIND
them.
MANAGER
I’m sorry, Mr. Sullivan. There,
there’s no money.
MANAGER 
No! No...I can get you money. I
just...it won’t be Chicago’s. They
took it all out two day’s ago.
SULLIVAN
Who authorized it?
MANAGER
The accountant.
SULLIVAN
What’s his name?
RANCE
This is Mr. Rance, in the Bridal
Suite...
And before you proffer your phony
congratulations, there is no Mrs.
Rance residing with me and I’m all the
better for it. Now, listen carefully,
because I am in no mood.
I am going to say this only once- I
would like a Boiled Egg. And I want
it runny.
MICHAEL
Pa, can we sleep in a motel room
tonight instead of the car?
SULLIVAN
Yeah that would be nice.
PROSTITUTE
How many more days you gonna want me,
Mister?
Can’t we close the curtains, even for
a little while? I can't get no sleep
with all this light.
SULLIVAN
Remember, if you see anything, you hit
the horn twice. And you don’t get out
of the car. No matter what.
MAGUIRE
Bye.
SULLIVAN
OK, you ready?
MICHAEL
I’m ready.
MANAGER
Yes, Sir, right away, Sir. Runny.
RANCE
Hmm.
It’s OPEN.
Top marks for speed. No marks for
COOKERY.
WHAT may I ASK do you call THIS?
SULLIVAN
Put it down.
RANCE
Mister Sullivan.
SULLIVAN
Mister Rance.
RANCE
How did you find me?
SULLIVAN
This is the best hotel in the area and
you are so very...particular.
RANCE
Yes indeed, Mister Sullivan, May I
ask you to lower your weapon?
RANCE 
Thank you. Now what do you want?
SULLIVAN
Information.
RANCE
I can’t give you the files.
Alright! Alright! They’re in the
next room.
In here.
SULLIVAN
Bring it in.
RANCE
I won’t be able to see!
SULLIVAN
Move.
RANCE
What do you think that you are going
to accomplish by interfering with our
business, Mister Sullivan?
SULLIVAN
This has nothing to do with your
business.
RANCE
It’s all business, that’s what you
fail to grasp.
And in business, you must have
something to trade. And you Mr.
Sullivan have nothing to trade.
Especially not for anyone as valuable
as Connor Rooney.
SULLIVAN
I don’t understand.
RANCE
Opening bell on Wall Street.
SULLIVAN
Come on, open it.
RANCE
Now which one is it?
No. That’s not it.
Tried that one already.
Better start over.
SULLIVAN
You’ve got one more try.
RANCE
Ah, here it is.
SULLIVAN
Go! Go!
I’m OK! I’m OK! Just watch the road.
MICHAEL
Pa?
MICHAEL 
Pa, are you okay?
Pa? Pa!
MICHAEL
Help! Help us!
VIRGINIA
When are you two heading out?
SULLIVAN
We’ve stayed long enough. Don’t want
to cause you any trouble.
VIRGINIA
No trouble so far.
VIRGINIA 
He’s a good worker.
SULLIVAN
You have any kids?
VIRGINIA
No, we met too late.
VIRGINIA 
He dotes on you.
You don’t see it?
SULLIVAN
Hello..
MICHAEL
I had a bad dream.
SULLIVAN
You want to talk about it?
SULLIVAN 
Well...come on in. Take a seat, if
you want.
MICHAEL
Math, huh?
SULLIVAN
Yeah. I always hated it.
MICHAEL
Me too.
SULLIVAN
So what do you like?
MICHAEL
Huh?
SULLIVAN
What subject d’you like - did you
like? In school?
MICHAEL
Bible History, maybe.
SULLIVAN
Why?
MICHAEL
I like the stories.
MICHAEL 
Peter was good at math.
SULLIVAN
Was he?
MICHAEL
Did you like Peter more than me?
SULLIVAN
No. No, Michael. I loved you both
the same.
MICHAEL
But you were different with me.
SULLIVAN
Was I?
Well, maybe that’s because Peter was
just such a sweet boy. You know? And
you...
SULLIVAN 
You were more like me. And... I
didn’t want you to be.
SULLIVAN 
I didn’t mean to be different.
MICHAEL
Okay
MICHAEL 
Good night, Pa.
SULLIVAN
Good night.
Michael, wake up. Get your things.
We’re leaving.
We left you something.
SULLIVAN
Hello, John.
ROONEY
You’re a smart man Michael.
SULLIVAN
I want to talk.
ROONEY
Here?
SULLIVAN
Downstairs.
ROONEY
I didn’t think I’d ever see you again.
SULLIVAN
Read this.
SULLIVAN 
Connor’s been stealing from you for
years. He’s kept accounts open under
the names of dead men. Men like the
McGoverns. And I stood there and
helped him kill Finn to line his own
pockets. I thought I was working for
you. But I wasn’t
ROONEY
You think I’d give up my son?
SULLIVAN
He was betraying you.
ROONEY
I know.
ROONEY 
Now listen to men. I tried to avoid
more bloodshed. You wouldn’t accept
that, so I did what was necessary.
But I’ve always loved you like a son.
Now I’m telling you. Leave. Before
it’s too late.
SULLIVAN
Think. Think. They’re protecting him
now - but when you’re gone, they’re
not going to need him anymore. This
ends with Connor dead no matter what.
ROONEY
That ay be. But you’re asking me to
give you the keys to his room, so you
can walk in, put a gun to his head,
and pull the trigger. I can’t do
that.
SULLIVAN
He murdered Annie and Peter.
ROONEY
There are only murderers in this room!
Michael, open your eyes! This is the
life we chose - the life we lead.
There is only one guarantee. None of
us will see heaven.
SULLIVAN
Michael could.
ROONEY
Then do everything you can to see that
that happens. Leave. I’m begging
you. It’s the only way.
SULLIVAN
And if I go?
ROONEY
Then I will mourn the son I lost.
MICHAEL
What are you going to do?
SULLIVAN
Just one last thing and then it’s
done.
SULLIVAN 
Go back to bed, Michael.
ROONEY
I’m glad it’s you.
NITTI
I understand. But Al wants your
assurance that after that... it’s
over.
The Lexington Hotel. Room 1432.
MICHAEL
Is that the house?
SULLIVAN
That’s it.
MICHAEL
Hey! I knew there was a dog.
SULLIVAN
Sarah? It’s me, Mike. We’re here.
MAGUIRE
Smile.
Give me the gun.
Michael?
Don’t you do this...
Come on.
Give me the gun.
MICHAEL
I couldn’t do it...
SULLIVAN
I know.
MICHAEL
Pa?
SULLIVAN
I’m sorry. Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
MICHAEL
Pa! Pa!
MICHAEL 
I saw then that my father’s only fear
was that his son would follow the same
road. And that was the last time I
ever held a gun.
MICHAEL 
People always thought I grew up on a
farm. And I guess in a way, I did.
MICHAEL  
But I lived a lifetime before that, in
those six weeks on the road, in the
winter of nineteen thirty-one.
When people ask me if Michael Sullivan
was a good man, or if there was just
no good in him at all, I always give
the same answer. I just tell them...
he was my father.
