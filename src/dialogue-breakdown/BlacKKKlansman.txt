	They say they may have lost the
	Battle but they didn't lose The War.
	Yes, Friends, We are under attack.
	BEAUREGARD- KLAN NARRATOR
	You've read about it in your Local
	Newspapers or seen it on The Evening
	News. That's right. We're living in
	an Era marked by the spread of
	Integration and Miscegenation.
	The Brown Decision forced upon us by
	The Jewish controlled Puppets on the
	U.S. Supreme Court compelling White
	children to go to School with an
	Inferior Race is The Final Nail in a
	Black Coffin towards America becoming
	a Mongrel Nation.
	We had a great way of Life before The
	Martin Luther Coon's of The World...
	...and their Army of Commies started
	their Civil Rights Assault on our
	Holy White Protestant Values.
	Do you really want your precious
	White Child going to School with
	Negroes?
	They are Lying, Dirty Monkeys...
	...Stopping at nothing to gain
	Equality with The White Man.
	Images and Scientific charts of Blacks compared to Apes and
	Monkeys.
	...Rapists, Murderers...Craving The
	Virgin, Pure Flesh of White Women.
	They are Super Predators...
	...and the Negro's insidious tactics
	under the tutelage of High Ranking
	Blood Sucking Jews! Using an Army of
	outside...
	...Northern Black Beast Agitators...
	...determined to overthrow The God
	Commanded and Biblically inspired
	Rule of The White Race.
	It's an International... Jewish...
	Conspiracy.
	MR. TURRENTINE
	Why weren't you drafted into the
	Vietnam War?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I went to College.
	MR. TURRENTINE
	How do you feel about Vietnam?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I have mixed feelings.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Would you call yourself a Womanizer?
	RON STALLWORTH
	No Sir, I would not.
	MR. TURRENTINE
	Do you frequent Night Clubs?
	RON STALLWORTH
	No Sir.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Do you drink?
	RON STALLWORTH
	On Special occasions, Sir.
	MR. TURRENTINE
	Have you ever done any Drugs?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Only those prescribed by My Doctor,
	Sir.
	Turrentine looks at Chief Bridges.
	MR. TURRENTINE
	That's kind of rare these days for a
	young Hip Soul Brother like you.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I know but my Father was in The
	Military and I was raised up the
	Right way, Sir.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	How are you with people, generally?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Sir, they treat me right, I treat
	them right, like I already said I was
	raised...
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	...Have you ever had any negative...
	MR. TURRENTINE
	...What would you do if another Cop
	called you a Nigger?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Would that happen...
	MR. TURRENTINE
	...Sheeeeeeettt!!!
	There's never been a Black Cop in
	this City. If we make you an Officer,
	you would, in effect, be the Jackie
	Robinson of the Colorado Springs
	Police force.
	And if you know anything about Jackie
	Robinson you know he had to take a
	lot of... guff... from his fellow
	Teammates, from Fans, other Teams,
	and The Press.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I know Jackie's Story, Sir.
	MR. TURRENTINE
	Good. So, knowing that, when someone
	calls you Nigger will you be able to
	turn the other Cheek?
	RON STALLWORTH
	If I need to, yes, Sir.
	MR. TURRENTINE
	Son, The Mayor and I think you might
	be The Man to open things up here.
	Ron looks at Chief Bridges.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	I'll have your back but I can only do
	so much. The Weight of this is on
	You...and You alone.
	Ron weighs The Journey ahead.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Cybill Shepherd. She was great in The
	Last Picture Show.
	OFFICER MULANEY
	Never saw it but what you think?
	RON STALLWORTH
	She's a very good Actress.
	OFFICER MULANEY
	Y'know you want some of that.
	Truth be told when I see one of your
	kind with a White Woman it turns my
	Stomach.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Yeah. Why's that?
	OFFICER MULANEY
	He could only want one thing.
	RON STALLWORTH
	What would that be?
	OFFICER MULANEY
	You like acting dumb, Y'know.
	RON STALLWORTH
	No, I just like my questions to be
	answered.
	WHEATON (O.S.)
	Hey! Anybody in there? Looking for a
	Toad here.
	Get me the record for this Toad named
	Tippy Birdsong.
	While you're at it, why don't you
	grab another Toad... Steven Wilson.
	Ron pulls the File... another young Black Male, another
	sexual predator!
	RON STALLWORTH
	While I've got you both here. Sirs,
	I'd like to be an Undercover
	Detective.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	What Narcotics?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Whatever Department works, Sir.
	SGT. TRAPP
	You just joined The Force, Rookie.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I know, Sir but I think I could do
	some good there.
	SGT. TRAPP
	Is that right?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Well, I'm young. I think there's a
	niche for me. Get In where I can Fit
	In.
	SGT. TRAPP
	What do you think, Chief?
	Sgt. Trapp sees the logic, looks to Chief Bridges, who stops,
	considering.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Think a lot of yourself, don't cha?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Just trying to be of help, Chief.
	Plus, I hate working in The Records
	room.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Well, I think Records is a good place
	for you to start, Rookie.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Chief, want me clean shaven?
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Keep it. I like the look.
	LANDERS
	Need a File on a Toad.
	You Deaf? I said I need info on a
	Toad.
	RON STALLWORTH
	No Toads here.
	LANDERS
	Excuse me?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I said, I don't have any Toads. I do
	have Human Beings and if you give me
	their names I can pull the Files.
	LANDERS
	Heard you think you Hot Shit but you
	ain't nuthin' but a Cold Fart. Name's
	Maurice, Maurice Smalls...That
	respectful enough for you, Officer
	Toad.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Hello.
	CHIEF BRIDGES (O.S.)
	It's Bridges. You sleeping?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Yes, Chief, I was. Just worked a
	Night Shift.
	CHIEF BRIDGES (O.S.)
	I changed my mind, you're gonna come
	in a little earlier today. We've got
	an assignment for you. 12 Noon.
	Sharp. Narcotics Division. Wear
	Street clothes.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Yes Sir, see you then. Thank You.
	Thank You.
	FLIP
	Rookie, you're late.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Sorry, it won't happen again.
	We've got limited time so I'll be
	quick. That Black Radical Stokely
	Carmichael is giving a Speech Tonight
	at Bell's Nightingale.
	RON STALLWORTH
	The Nightclub?
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	No, Emmanuel Missionary Baptist
	Church!!!
	Carmichael is a former High MuckityMuck with The Black Panthers and as
	far as I'm concerned, FBI Director J.
	Edgar Hoover was dead right when he
	said The Black Panthers are The
	Greatest Internal Threat to The
	Security of these United States. This
	Carmichael Joker, former Panther or
	not, they say he's a Damn Good
	Speaker and we don't want this
	Carmichael getting into The Minds of
	the Black People here in Colorado
	Springs and stirring them up.
	Ron, your assignment is to go to this
	Speech tonight and infiltrate these
	Bunch of Subversives and monitor The
	Audience reaction to Carmichael. You
	ready?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Born Ready.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Any chance this thing Fucks Up?
	FLIP
	Fuck yeah.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Then what?
	JIMMY
	Just stick to The Game Plan.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Which is?
	FLIP
	Improvise. Like Jazz. This isn't some
	Big Bust. We just want some Intel,
	that's it.
	JIMMY
	What happens if someone offers you a
	Marijuana Cigarette?
	RON STALLWORTH
	You mean a Joint?
	JIMMY
	Yeah.
	RON STALLWORTH
	"Soul Brother, I'm already High on
	Life. Can you Dig It?"
	FLIP
	And if someone pulls a Gun on you?
	RON STALLWORTH
	You expecting that?
	FLIP
	Barrel of a 45's in your face, Finger
	on the Trigger, now what?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Blood, get that Gun out my face.
	Peace Love and Soul.
	FLIP
	Gun is still in your face.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I de-escalate. Talk calmly, firmly.
	Find a way out of there, A-Sap.
	FLIP
	Relax, we'll be outside, listening
	in.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Can I order a Drink at The Bar?
	JIMMY
	That's fine, just don't get Shit
	Faced.
	FLIP
	Got it?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I got it. I'm gone.
	RON STALLWORTH
	How are you doing, my Soul Sista?
	PATRICE
	I'm doing fine, my Brother. This is
	going to be an Amazing Night.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Indeed it is.
	PATRICE
	Have you heard Brother Kwame speak
	before?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Who?
	PATRICE
	Kwame Ture.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Actually, I haven't, I didn't know he
	changed his name.
	PATRICE
	Yes, after he moved to Africa. He
	took the names of Kwame Nkrumah of
	Ghana and his Mentor Sekou Toure of
	Guinea to honor The Great Leaders.
	RON STALLWORTH
	That's Heavy. Do you know how he got
	to Colorado Springs?
	PATRICE
	The Colorado College Black Student
	Union invited Brother Ture.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I can dig it. I can dig it. You with
	The Black Student Union?
	PATRICE
	I'm The President.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Right On. Right On.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Rum and Coke with Lime.
	PATRICE
	The Black Student Union of Colorado
	College is honored to bring The
	Vanguard of Revolutionaries fighting
	for The Rights of Black People all
	over The World. Let's show some Black
	Love to The One and Only, The Former
	Prime Minister of The Black Panther
	Party, The Brother Man with The Plan
	who's stickin'it to the Man, put your
	Hands together my People... for Our
	Kwame Ture.
	KWAME TURE
	Thank you all for coming out tonight,
	My Beloved Sista's and Brotha's. I
	Thank you...
	...I'm here to tell you this evening
	it is time for you to stop running
	away from being Black. You are
	College Students, you should think. 
	KWAME TURE
	Is Beauty defined by someone with a
	Narrow Nose? Thin Lips? White Skin?
	You ain't got none of that. If your
	Lips are Thick, Bite them in. Hold
	your Nose! Don't drink Coffee because
	it makes you Black!
	Your Nose is Boss, your Lips are
	Thick, your skin is Black, you are
	Black and you are Beautiful!
	We want to be like The White people
	that oppress us in this Country and
	since they hate us, we hate
	ourselves. You dig Tarzan? I remember
	that when I was a Boy I used to go
	see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays. I
	loved me some Jane too. Jane was A
	Fine White Woman. White Tarzan used
	to Beat up The Black Natives. I would
	sit there yelling "Kill The Beasts,
	Kill The Savages, Kill 'Em!" Actually
	I was saying: "Kill Me." It was as if
	a Jewish Boy watched Nazis taking
	Jews off to Concentration Camps and
	cheered them on. Today, I want The
	Chief to beat The Hell out of Tarzan
	and send him back to The Caves of
	Europe. But it takes time to become
	Free of The Lies and their shaming
	effect on Black Minds. It takes time
	to reject the most Important Lie:
	that Black People inherently can't do
	the same things White People can do
	unless White People help them.
	It is time for you to understand that
	you as The growing Intellectuals of
	this Country, you must define Beauty
	for Black People, Now that's Black
	Power.
	BLACK MASS
	Black Power!!! Black Power!!!
	RON STALLWORTH
	Right on!!! Right On!!!
	If a White Man wants to Lynch Me,
	that's his Problem. If he's got The
	Power to Lynch Me, that's My Problem.
	Racism is not a question of Attitude;
	it's a question of Power.
	The vast majority of Negroes in this
	Country live in Captive Communities
	and must endure their conditions of
	Oppression because and only because
	they are Black and Powerless. Now We
	are being shot down like Dogs in the
	streets by White Racist Police. We
	can no longer accept this Oppression
	without retribution. The War in
	Vietnam is Illegal and Immoral. I'd
	rather see a Brother Kill a Cop than
	Kill a Vietnamese. At least he's got
	a reason for Killing The Cop. When
	you Kill a Vietnamese you're a Hero
	and you don't even know why you
	Killed him. At least if you Kill a
	Cop you're doing it for a reason.
	In closing I know it's getting late,
	may I leave you Sista's and Brothers
	with these Last Words. "If I am not
	for myself, who will be? If I am for
	myself alone, who am I? If not now,
	when? And if not you, who?" We need
	an Undying Love for Black People
	wherever We may be. Good Night and
	power to the people, power to the people.
	KWAME TURE AND BLACK MASS
	all power to all the people
	all power to all the people
	all power to all the people
	RON STALLWORTH
	Brother Ture, do you really think a
	War between The Black and White Race
	is inevitable?
	KWAME TURE
	Brother, arm yourself. Get ready.
	The Revolution is coming. We must
	pick up a Gun and prepare
	ourselves...Trust me, it is coming.
	Thank you for your support, Brother.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I don't know what you have planned
	now but maybe I could buy you a
	Drink?
	PATRICE
	I'm waiting for Brother Kwame, I have
	to make sure he gets back safely to
	the Hotel and he's squared away.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I can dig it.
	PATRICE
	Maybe, if it's not too late, I'll
	meet you at The Red Lantern. You know
	where that is?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I do.
	PATRICE
	So I'll see you then.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Cool. All Power to All The People.
	PATRICE
	Sorry I'm late...
	...You won't believe what happened.
	Bro Pope, Seven and Seven, please...
	The Pigs pulled us over.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Say what?
	PATRICE
	Yeah, they knew Brother Kwame was in
	Town. Made us get out the Car. Pigs
	pulled us over for no reason. Total
	harassment.
	RON STALLWORTH
	True?
	PATRICE
	Truth. Do Four Dogs have Four
	Assholes?
	We're tired of Police Brutality.
	We're tired of Police Murdering Black
	Folks.
	LANDERS
	All right everybody out the vehicle.
	Now!!!
	I don't wanna see nuthin' but Black
	Asses and Black Elbows. Spread 'em!!!
	Search The Car. I know these Niggers
	are holding something.
	You that so called Big Shot Panther
	Nigger aren't you? Heard you was in
	Town, Stokely.
	KWAME TURE
	My Name is Kwame Ture.
	LANDERS
	I know you Black Bastards are
	holding. What you got in there some
	Weed, Pills, Heroin?
	OFFICER CINCER
	It's clean.
	LANDERS
	You get this Black Panther outta'
	Colorado Springs before Sunrise. Hear
	me??? Or you all go to Jail.
	KWAME TURE
	Black people were Born in Jail.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Did you see the Officer's names?
	PATRICE
	I know I should have but the whole
	thing was so frightening... I didn't.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm sorry.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	What was the Room like?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Folks were hanging on every word.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Sounds like he had them pretty riled
	up?
	RON STALLWORTH
	But I'm not sure that means Black
	Folks were ready to start a
	Revolution.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	What makes you think that?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Nobody was talking about that. That
	wasn't the Mood. Everybody was Cool.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	So let me get this straight. He told
	a Crowd of "Black Folks" to get ready
	for a Race War. That they were going
	to have to arm themselves and kill
	Cops. What about that?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Yeah, he said that but I think that
	was just talk. You know, Rhetoric.
	FLIP
	That's what I thought too.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Thank God, Carmichael has left
	Colorado Springs.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Kwame Ture.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	What?
	RON STALLWORTH
	He changed his name from Stokely
	Carmichael to Kwame Ture.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	I don't care if he changed his name
	to Muhammad Ali, he's still
	dangerous.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Did you hear the Story Patrice told
	me about how the CSPD pulled over her
	and Ture?
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	No. We didn't hear that.
	Patrice. Isn't she the one from The
	Black Student Union? They brought TooRay in.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Kwame Ture, Correct.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	You getting pretty Chummy with her?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Just doing my job, Chief. Undercover.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Yeah and it better not be Under the
	Cover Of The Sheets.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I would never jeopardize a Case...
	CHIEF BRIDGES

	you just got here.
	FLIP
	Good work.
	JIMMY

	CHIEF BRIDGES

	This is Ron Stallworth.
	WALTER BREACHWAY (O.S.)
	This is Walter. Returning your
	call... From The Organization.
	RON STALLWORTH
	The Organization?
	WALTER BREACHWAY(O.S.)
	Yes. Well we appreciate your
	interest. So what is your Story, Ron?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Since you asked- I Hate Niggers,
	Jews, Mexicans, Spics, Chinks but
	especially those Niggers and anyone
	else that does not have pure White
	Aryan Blood running through their
	Veins.
	In fact, my Sister, Pamela, was
	recently accosted by a Nigger...
	WALTER BREACHWAY (O.S.)
	...Is that so?
	RON STALLWORTH
	...Every time I think about that
	Black Baboon putting his Filthy Black
	Hands on her White as Pure Driven
	Snow Body I wanna Puke!!!
	WALTER BREACHWAY(O.S.)
	You're just the kind of Guy we're
	looking for. Ron, when can we meet?
	RON STALLWORTH
	How about Friday night? After I get
	off work?
	WALTER BREACHWAY(O.S.)

	RON STALLWORTH

	FLIP
	Good Luck Ron with your New Redneck

	SGT. TRAPP
	They want you to join The Klan?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Well... they want to meet me First.
	SGT. TRAPP
	They want to meet you?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'll need another Undercover to go in
	my place.
	SGT. TRAPP
	Yeah... you probably shouldn't go to
	that meeting.
	RON STALLWORTH
	You think?
	Everyone has a Chuckle.
	SGT. TRAPP
	We'd have to go to Narcotics. Meaning
	we'd have to deal with Bridges.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Damn.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	I can't spare any Men.
	SGT. TRAPP
	I've looked over the Logs and it
	seems you can spare them.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Sgt. Trapp, Ron spoke to the Man on
	the phone. When they hear the Voice
	of one of my Guys, they'll know the
	difference.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Why so, Chief?
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Want me to spell it out? He'll know
	the difference between how a White
	Man talks and a Negro.
	RON STALLWORTH
	What does a Black Man talk like?
	SGT. TRAPP
	Ron, I think what The Chief is trying
	to say is...
	RON STALLWORTH
	...If you don't mind, I'd like to
	talk for myself, Thank You. How
	exactly does a Black Man talk?
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	You know... you know!!!
	RON STALLWORTH
	Chief, some of us can speak King's
	English and Jive. I happen to be
	fluent in both.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Ron, how do you propose to make this
	Investigation?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I have established contact and
	created some familiarity with The
	Klansmen over the phone. I will
	continue that role but another
	Officer, a White Officer, will play
	Me when they meet Face to Face.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	...My Point Exactly!!!...
	RON STALLWORTH
	Black Ron Stallworth on The phone and
	White Ron Stallworth Face to Face, so
	there becomes a combined Ron
	Stallworth.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Can you do that?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I believe we can... With The Right
	White Man.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	If anything happens to my Man there
	won't be Two Ron Stallworths.
	There'll be none.
	FLIP
	You're late.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
	JIMMY
	I heard that somewhere before.
	FLIP
	Hey, Jimmy when's the last time they
	let a Rookie head up an
	Investigation. Oh that's right,
	NEVER.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Can we move on to the Bio, please.
	FLIP

	Manufacturing.

	Long ride.
	FLIP

	RON STALLWORTH

	although the Signal starts to cut out
	near Pueblo. On the way back I go for
	102.7 to get my Allman Brothers Fix.
	Only I have to change every time that
	British Fag David Bowie pipes on.
	JIMMY
	I love Bowie.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Remember you've got to retain the
	details of what you share with them
	so I can be White Ron Stallworth.
	FLIP
	Jimmy, I always wanted to grow up to

	Fair? I get to play you and Jimmy and
	all the other guys in the Station...
	Everyday.
	Flip doesn't understand, he looks at Jimmy. Both befuddled.
	RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
	Who are you meeting?
	FLIP
	Walter Breachway.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Become Walter's Friend, get invited
	back.
	FLIP
	Look at you. Is that it, Sir?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm on the phone with The Klan, You
	see them in person...
	FLIP
	...And...
	RON STALLWORTH
	...And you need to sound like my
	voice.
	JIMMY
	Oh Boy.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Just repeat after me.
	Ron hands out a piece of paper to Flip and Jimmy.
	FLIP
	The Godfather.
	CLOSE - RON STALLWORTH
	RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
	Look a'here, some people say we got a
	lot of malice. Some say it's a lotta
	nerve.
	FLIP
	Look a'here, some people say we got a
	lot of malice. Some say it's a lotta
	nerve.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I saw we won't quit moving 'Til we
	get what we deserve.
	FLIP
	I saw we won't quit moving 'Til we
	get what we deserve.
	RON STALLWORTH
	We've been buked and we've been
	scorned. We've been treated bad,
	talked about.
	FLIP
	We've been buked and we've been
	scorned. We've been treated bad,
	talked about.
	RON STALLWORTH
	As Just as sure as you're born But
	just as sure as it take.
	FLIP
	As Just as sure as you're born But
	just as sure as it take.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Two eyes to make a pair, huh.
	FLIP
	Two eyes to make a pair, huh.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Brother, we can't quit until we get
	our share.
	FLIP
	Brother, we can't quit until we get
	our share.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Say it loud. I'm Black and I'm proud.
	FLIP
	Say it loud. I'm Black and I'm proud.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Jimmy, join us.
	RON STALLWORTH, FLIP AND JIMMY
	Say it loud. I'm Black and I'm proud.
	Say it loud. I'm Black and I'm proud.
	JIMMY
	Don't forget to lose that Star of
	David around your neck.
	RON STALLWORTH
	You're Jewish?
	RON STALLWORTH
	It's Walter.
	FELIX
	Ron Stallworth?
	FLIP
	That's me. And you must be Walter.
	FELIX
	Name's Felix.
	FLIP
	I was told I'd be meeting with Walter
	Breachway.
	FELIX
	Change of plans, Mack. I'm gonna need
	you to hop in The Pickup.
	Even with his slouched shoulders, Felix towers over Flip.
	FLIP
	Okay, well how about I just follow
	you...
	FELIX
	...No Can Do. You come with me.
	Security.
	INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT
	FELIX
	You for The White Race, Ron?
	FLIP
	Hell Yeah!!! Been having some trouble
	lately with these Local Niggers.
	FELIX
	Since The Civil War it's always
	trouble with Niggers.
	Walter said something about your
	Sister?
	FLIP
	Makes me Sick.
	FLIP
	But it's also the, like, camaraderie
	I'm looking for...with The Klan.
	FELIX
	Da Fuck did you say?
	FLIP
	Camaraderie...?
	FELIX
	No. The other word.
	FLIP
	The Klan...?
	FELIX
	...Not "The Klan." It's The
	Organization. The Invisible Empire
	has managed to stay Invisible for a
	reason. Do Not Ever Use That Word.
	You understand?
	FLIP
	I overstand... Right. The
	Organization.
	FELIX
	Check this Shit out... you're never
	gonna believe it.
	FLIP
	What?
	FELIX
	There's a Jig on our Bumper.
	Flip Freezes.
	JIMMY
	He sees us. Back Off.
	Ron eases on the Gas.
	FELIX
	Let's be ready, case we gotta go and
	shoot us A Alabama Porch Monkey.
	Look under your seat. Pull it out.
	FLIP
	Pull out what?
	Felix snaps his finger at Flip, who jumps.
	FELIX
	Under the seat!!!
	Flip reaches to his Feet. Pulls out a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN.
	Load 'er up. One in The Chamber.
	Flip is hesitant.
	Load it!!!
	FLIP
	Ready to go.
	FELIX
	That's right, Porch Monkey. Don't be
	Messin' with us...
	FLIP
	...The Organization.
	FELIX
	Not so fast, Buddy Boy.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Just a Bar.
	Think he got a good look at My Face?
	JIMMY
	Probably.
	WALTER
	Ron. Glad you could make it. Walter
	Breachway, Chapter President.
	FLIP
	I appreciate you inviting me out.
	WALTER
	I've been impressed with our phone
	conversations. I feel you have some
	fine ideas that could help The Cause.
	FLIP
	I meant every word I said.
	WALTER
	How 'bout some pool?
	I've had my own share of Run-Ins with
	Niggers. Matter of fact, it's part of
	what led me to The Organization.
	FLIP
	That right?
	WALTER
	It became my salvation. After I was
	shot and wounded by some Niggers. My
	Wife... Savagely Raped by a whole
	Pack of 'EM, and not a one went to
	Jail.
	JIMMY
	Never happened.
	WALTER
	They're taking over. That's all you
	see on the TV Anymore. Niggers.
	Niggers selling Soap, Niggers selling
	Automobiles, Niggers selling
	Toothpaste, Niggers, Niggers,
	Niggers.
	IVANHOE
	Wasn't long ago them Sumbitches
	wasn't on no TV.
	WALTER

	Jemima.
	IVANHOE
	Dang!!! You know, I gotta say I kinda
	like dem' Niggers...Rice and
	Pancakes.
	Name's Ivanhoe, by the way.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Mad at Sanford and Son and Flip
	Wilson.
	INT. CORNER POCKET LOUNGE - NIGHT
	WALTER
	All you get now is how we gotta'
	cater to them. We gotta' get us some

	Niggers. Make it Fuckin' simple.
	ALL

	FELIX
	You ain't the only one.
	FLIP
	You don't know how good it is to hear
	someone that gets it.
	What kinda stuff you Guys do?
	IVANHOE
	You know, Cross burnings. Marches and
	stuff so people don't Fuck wit' us.
	FLIP
	I'm tired of people Fuckin' with me.
	WALTER
	You come to the right place cuz'
	Nobody Fucks with us. How much you
	know about The History?
	FLIP
	Some...I could know more.
	WALTER
	We'll teach you.
	IVANHOE
	This year's gonna be big for us.
	FLIP
	How so?
	IVANHOE
	Boom!!! We're gonna make Fireworks,
	yes we are...
	Walter swoops in.
	WALTER
	...Ivanhoe talking nonsense again.
	Kid can't hold his Beer fer Shit. The
	Organization is strictly NonViolent...
	IVANHOE
	...Like dat Dead Nigger Martin Luther
	Coon.
	FLIP
	Gotcha...
	WALTER
	Say, Ron? Mind coming with me?
	FLIP
	Where to?
	FELIX
	You Undercover or something? You ask
	too many questions. Let's GO!!!
	JIMMY
	Where they going?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Lost the damn signal.
	WALTER
	Congrats you passed The Mustard.
	Thought we'd get the Membership
	process started.
	FLIP
	Now we're talkin'.
	Walter hands Flip a stack of papers.
	WALTER
	Fill these out and Mail 'em to The
	National Headquarters. Once they send
	your Membership Card, you'll be able
	to participate in our Programs.
	FLIP
	Alcoa Can't wait.
	IVANHOE
	I like those Commercials.
	WALTER
	Imperial Tax to become a Member: Ten
	Dollars for The Year. Fifteen Dollar
	Chapter Fee. Robes and Hoods not
	included, that's Extra.
	FELIX
	Fuckin' Inflation.
	FLIP
	I can't thank you Brothers enough.
	WALTER
	Pleasure, is all ours.
	I'll take you back to your Car.
	FELIX
	You're not a Jew, right?
	FLIP
	You trying to offend me?
	FELIX
	It's Protocol.
	FLIP
	'Course I'm no Stinkin' Kike.
	WALTER
	We gotta ask it, is all. I'm
	satisfied. How about you Guys?
	FELIX
	Smells Kosher to me.
	FLIP
	Stop fuckin' 'round.
	WALTER
	Felix, cut it out.
	FLIP
	You have me dressed like one of
	the Beverly Hillbillies for
	Chrissakes. I felt too Redneck for
	those Guys.
	RON STALLWORTH
	They liked you.
	FLIP
	Except for that Felix Guy. Do not
	ride his Bumper like that! Two car
	lengths!
	RON STALLWORTH
	You got The Papers? They want you to
	join.
	FLIP
	Technically they want you to join.
	RON STALLWORTH
	They want a Black Man to join The Ku
	Klux Klan. I'd call that Mission
	Impossible. Double Success.
	SGT. TRAPP
	And exactly how much should we be
	worrying about them?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Enough that we'd like to dig deeper.
	One of the Men discussed plans for a
	possible Attack...
	FLIP
	...I wouldn't give him that much
	credit. These Yahoos like to Boast.
	SGT. TRAPP
	What kind of Attack?
	FLIP
	Ivanhoe said "BOOM", mentioned
	something about Fireworks.
	Personally, I didn't buy it. Doubt
	they're even capable.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Either way, we're looking for full
	support from The Department.
	SGT. TRAPP
	We're moving on with the
	Investigation.
	PATRICE
	The next day when we dropped Brother
	Kwame off at the Airport he told me
	The Black Power Movement needed
	Strong Sistah's like me to lead the
	fight against Capitalist oppression
	and The Politicians and Pigs who
	perpetuate it. His words almost made
	that whole Pig Nightmare worth
	while...
	...What's wrong?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I don't really use that word.
	PATRICE
	What word?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Pigs.
	PATRICE
	What else would you call them?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Cops... Police...
	PATRICE
	Bunch of Racist Cops on a Power Trip.
	RON STALLWORTH
	So you think all Cops are Racist?
	PATRICE
	It only takes One to pull a Trigger
	on a Innocent Sister or Brother.
	Why were you at Brother Kwame's
	Speech?
	RON STALLWORTH
	He's got some good ideas. I don't
	agree with all of them but he's a
	smart Brother who's worth hearing.
	PATRICE
	Are you Down for The Liberation of
	Black People?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Do we always have to talk about
	Politics?
	PATRICE
	What's more important?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Do you ever take any time off from
	The Liberation of Black People?
	PATRICE
	No!!! It's a Lifetime JOB!!!
	Sista Angela Davis, can we spend some
	quality time together.
	PATRICE
	And what did you say your J-O-B is?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Kathleen Cleaver, I didn't?
	PATRICE
	Are You A Pig?
	RON STALLWORTH
	You mean A Cop?
	PATRICE
	You A Cop?
	RON STALLWORTH
	NO I'm a Black Man who wants to get
	to know A Strong, Intelligent,
	Beautiful Sister.
	RON STALLWORTH
	This is Ron.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	This is Walter. Is this Ron? Your
	Voice sounds different over The
	Phone.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Allergies acting up again.
	A steady Beat of Silence on The Line. Then...
	WALTER (O.S.)
	...Yeah, I get that all the time.
	Well, just thought I'd say it was
	great having you swing by. The
	Brothers really took a liking to you.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm honored.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	Why don't you come by Felix's this
	Saturday? Meet the rest of The
	Brotherhood.
	SGT. TRAPP
	I've got a friend that's up with
	these Groups. He says they're moving
	away from the Ole Violent Racist
	Style. That's what Davis is peddling
	now, it's become Mainstream.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Davis?
	SGT. TRAPP
	Devin Davis current Grand Wizard of
	The Klan, always in a three piece
	suit, he now goes by National
	Director. He's clearly got his Sights
	on Higher Office.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Political Office? How so?
	SGT. TRAPP
	Yeah, I guess they're trying to move
	away from their History of Selling
	hate...
	RON STALLWORTH
	...Keep going.
	SGT. TRAPP
	Affirmative Action, Immigration,
	Crime, Tax Reform. He said no one
	wants to be called a Bigot anymore.
	Archie Bunker made that too Un-Cool.
	The idea is under all these issues,
	everyday Americans can accept it,
	support it, until eventually, one
	day, you get somebody in The White
	House that embodies it.
	RON STALLWORTH
	America would never elect somebody
	like Devin Davis President of the
	United States of America?
	SGT. TRAPP
	For a so called Black Man, you're
	pretty naive. 
	CONNIE
	Ron! So nice to meet you. I'm Connie,
	Felix's Wife.
	FLIP
	Great to meet you.
	CONNIE
	The Boys are in the Backyard.
	CONNIE
	Sorry to interrupt. I have some
	Cheese Dip and Crackers.
	FELIX
	Thanks Honey.
	FELIX
	Make 'em remember who We Are and What
	We Stand For. We are The
	Organization.
	CONNIE
	I read in The Gazette some Nigger
	named Carmichael held a Rally and
	there's some College Nigger Girl with
	the "Baboon Student Union" attacking
	Our Police. This Girl is Dangerous.
	Reminds me of that Commie Angela
	Davis. We need to shut her damn
	mouth.
	Here, I clipped the Article.
	Connie pulls The Article from her apron. Hands it to Felix.
	Felix eyes it, focused on an image of Kwame and without
	looking up...
	FELIX
	That'll be all. Love you Sweetie.
	CONNIE
	One of these days you're going to
	need me to do something for you. Wait
	and See.
	WALTER
	How 'bout We focus on our Bread and
	Butter. The Next Cross Burning.
	Which, Flip, you'll be lucky enough
	to participate in if your Membership
	Card comes soon enough...
	FLIP
	...That'd be a tremendous Honor.
	Where?
	WALTER
	The Highest Hills get the most Eyes.
	FELIX
	Hey Ron, I gotta show you something.
	Looka here.
	FLIP
	Wow. This is really... something.
	FELIX
	Here's my favorite. Twelve Gauge.
	I call this...The Jew Killer.
	FLIP
	That's a Remington Model 1900.
	FELIX
	Indeed it is.
	Door.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	Almost done in here? We still have
	some items on The Agenda...
	FELIX
	...Not just yet. Gotta make sure
	there's no Jew in him.
	WALTER
	Come on Man, this is just
	Straight-Up Offensive. We're
	talking about someone who's gonna be
	our Brother in a couple months. Is
	there a fuckin' Star of David around
	his Neck? Does Ron got a YA-MA-KA on
	his HEAD for Pete's sake?
	FELIX (O.S.)
	Just Protocol. My House, My Rules.
	This way.
	FLIP
	Where...uh...where ya takin' me? I
	told you already I'm not thrilled
	with you callin' me a Jew.
	FELIX
	Tough Titty.
	Take a seat.
	Felix sets Flip down on a chair.
	WALTER
	Felix, it ain't necessary, Man. This
	is how we lose recruits!
	FLIP
	What is this your Jew Den? This where
	you make your Candles? Lamp shades?
	FELIX
	No, you're going to take this Lie
	Detector test.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Shit.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	Open up, Felix! Enough is Enough!!!
	FELIX
	Lower your Arm right here.
	FLIP
	Felix, this is lame bullshit.
	FELIX
	Lame or not you're taking this Jew
	Lie Detector Test.
	FLIP
	Out of respect, I'm gonna play along
	with your Get Smart Bullshit, but I'm
	No Fuckin' Jew!!!
	FELIX
	Siddown.
	FELIX
	Ask anybody, they'll say I'm a real
	Friendly Guy. Thing is, I'm only
	Friendly to my Friends, not JEW
	Friendly, Damn Sure not Nigger
	Friendly.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	Let me in!
	FELIX
	Let's warm up. What is the surname of
	your Biological Father?
	FLIP
	Stallworth.
	FELIX
	Let me see your Dick.
	FLIP
	You like pretty Dicks Felix?
	FELIX
	I hear you Jews do something Funny
	with ya Dicks. Some weird Jew Shit.
	Is your Dick circumstanced?
	FLIP
	You tryin' to suck my Jew Dick?
	Faggot.
	FELIX
	Who you callin' a Faggot, Jew?
	FELIX
	Y’know what I think?
	FLIP
	You think?
	FELIX
	I think a lot.
	FLIP
	What do you think about?
	FELIX
	I think this Holocaust stuff never
	happened.
	FLIP
	What?
	FELIX
	That’s the biggest Jewish Conspiracy.
	8 Million Jews killed? Concentration
	camps? Never happened. Where’s the
	proof?
	FLIP
	Are you High?
	FELIX
	I don’t get High. I drink.
	FLIP
	Haven't seen the Footage.
	FELIX
	Fake. Jews run Hollywood.
	CONNIE
	There's a Fuckin' Black Lawn Jockey
	on our Green Lawn!
	Felix storms out of The Den. Flip rips off The Polygraph
	Sensors and follows.
	FLIP
	Yeah, keep drivin' you Black
	Spearchucker!!! Piece a Shit
	Nigger!!!
	FELIX
	Almost got 'im.
	FLIP
	Felix, you still want me to take your
	Jew Detector Test!!!
	Walter looks from Flip to Felix. Felix can only shrug.
	FELIX
	Everybody go Home NOW!!! Get Outta
	Here!!! Go home!!!
	SGT. TRAPP
	Lie Detector? Shots Fired? A Goddamn
	ClusterFuck!!! You Dickheads are
	putting me in a Tough Spot here. If
	Bridges heard about this...
	RON STALLWORTH
	Is he gonna hear about it, Sarge?
	I didn't say it in there with Trapp
	but that Peckerwood had a Gun in my
	Face and he was an Ass Hair away from
	pulling The Trigger.
	RON STALLWORTH
	And he didn't.
	FLIP
	But he could have and then I woulda
	been Dead... for what? Stoppin' some
	Jerkoffs from playing Dress up?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Flip, it's Intel.
	FLIP
	I'm not risking my Life to prevent
	some Rednecks from lighting a couple
	Sticks on Fire.
	RON STALLWORTH
	This is the Job. What's your problem?
	FLIP
	Ron, you're my problem.
	RON STALLWORTH
	How's that?
	FLIP
	For you it's not a job, it's a
	Crusade. It's not personal nor should
	it be.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Why haven't you bought into this?
	FLIP
	Why should I?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Because you're Jewish, Brother. The
	So-Called Chosen People.
	You're passing, Man.
	FLIP
	What?
	RON STALLWORTH
	You're passing for a WASP!!! White
	Anglo Saxon Protestant, All-American
	Hot Dog, Cherry Pie White Boy. It's
	what some Light-Skinned Black Folks
	do, they pass for White.
	Doesn't that Hatred The Klan say Piss
	you off.
	FLIP
	Of course it does.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Then why you acting like you ain't
	got skin in the Game!
	FLIP
	That's my Damn Business!
	RON STALLWORTH
	It's our Business.
	I'm gonna get your Membership Card so
	you can go on this Cross Burning and
	get in deeper, right Flip?
	VOICE (O.S.)
	Wake up White Man, The Negro wants
	your White Woman and your Job! The
	Jew wants your Money...
	PLEASANT MAN (O.S.)
	Hello, and whom am I talking to?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Good afternoon. My name is Ron
	Stallworth, calling from Colorado
	Springs. How are you today, Sir?
	PLEASANT MAN
	Quite well, Ron. What can I do for
	you?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm calling because I desperately
	want to participate in my Chapter's
	Honorary Events but I can't until I
	receive my Membership Card.
	PLEASANT MAN (O.S.)
	Of course, I can help you with that.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Thank you. Who am I speaking with?
	PLEASANT MAN (O.S.)
	This is Devin Davis.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm sorry... did you just say you're
	Devin Davis?
	DEVIN DAVIS(O.S.)
	...Last time I checked.
	RON STALLWORTH
	...Grand Wizard of The Ku Klux Klan?
	That Devin Davis?
	DEVIN DAVIS(O.S.)
	That Grand Wizard and National
	Director.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Really? National Director too?
	DEVIN DAVIS(O.S.)
	Really.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm honored to be speaking with you.
	I'm not afraid to say it...I consider
	you a True White American Hero.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Are there any other kind?
	DEVIN DAVIS
	And I'm just happy to be talking to a
	True White American.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Amen, Mr. Davis. Seems like there's
	less and less of us these days.
	Now about that Membership Card...
	Davis unwraps a stick of Juicy Fruit Gum, his favorite.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	...I understand the situation. We've
	been having some Administrative
	problems that have caused a backlog.
	...Tell you what, Ron. I'll see to it
	personally that your Membership Card
	is processed and sent out today.
	RON
	Thank you, Mr. Davis. I can't express
	to you how much I appreciate this.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	The pleasure is all mine. I look
	forward to meeting you in person One
	Day and God Bless White America.
	LANDERS
	Watch where you're going. You could
	get hurt like that Hot Shot.
	RON STALLWORTH
	That Cop that pulled Kwame Ture over
	that night... was it Landers?
	FLIP
	How'd you know?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I can smell em' a Mile away now.
	FLIP
	He's been a Bad Cop for a long time.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Yeah?
	FLIP
	Does that kinda' Shit all the time.
	Few years ago, he allegedly Shot and
	Killed a Black Kid... he said he had
	a Gun. The Kid wasn't the type.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Flip, why do you tolerate this?
	FLIP
	We're a family. Good or Bad. We stick
	together. You wanna be the Guy that
	Rats him out?
	You're New. You're a Rookie. You ever
	get your Ass in a Jam, you'll
	appreciate The Blue Wall of Silence.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Yeah, reminds me of another Group.
	FELIX
	Bullseye.
	WALTER
	... and then you got what used to be
	a decent Bar, The Hide N Seek Room,
	turned into a Filthy Fag Bar
	overnight.
	FLIP
	Fuckin' Fags everywhere these days.
	WALTER
	They're trying to Colonize. First

	FLIP

	Guys Army-trained?

	RON STALLWORTH
	Bernie Casey's a Badd Brother.
	PATRICE
	Cleopatra Jones was the one. It's
	about time We see a strong Sister
	like that...
	RON STALLWORTH
	...And Tamara Dobson played a Cop. 
	PATRICE
	That was a Black Exploitation Movie.
	A fantasy. Real life's not like that.
	In real life there's no Cleopatra
	Jones or Coffy.
	RON STALLWORTH
	You don't dig Pam Grier? She's Fine
	as Wine and twice as Mellow.
	PATRICE
	Pam Grier is doing her Thing but in
	real life it's just Pigs killing
	Black Folks.
	RON STALLWORTH
	What if a Cop was trying to make
	things better.
	PATRICE
	From the inside?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Yeah, from the inside.
	PATRICE
	You can't make things better from the
	inside. It's a Racist System.
	RON STALLWORTH
	So just give up?
	PATRICE
	No!!! We fight for what Black People
	really need! BLACK LIBERATION!!!
	RON STALLWORTH
	Can't you do that from the inside!
	PATRICE
	No! You can't. White Man won't let
	us.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I know how that feels. I'm Two damn
	people all the time!
	PATRICE
	But you shouldn't be! We shouldn't
	have a War going on inside ourselves.
	Why can't we just be Black People?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Because we're not there yet!
	PATRICE
	Well, I'm tired of waiting!
	RON STALLWORTH
	Shaft or Superfly?
	PATRICE
	What?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Pick one, Shaft or Superfly?
	PATRICE
	A Private Detective over a Pimp any
	day and twice on Sundays.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Richard Roundtree or Ron O'Neal?
	PATRICE
	Richard Roundtree. Pimps Ain't No
	Heroes.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Ron O'Neal isn't a Pimp. He's just
	playing one.
	PATRICE
	That image does damage to Our People.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Jesus christ!!! Give it a rest.
	PATRICE
	I can't you JIVE TURKEY.
	FELIX
	Wrong address.
	Felix backs away as Patrice peeks from around Ron seeing
	Felix. Felix sees her, turning to walk away.
	PATRICE
	Who was that?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Nobody.
	FLIP
	Hey, sorry had to work late. How you
	guys doing?
	FELIX
	You got a Twin.
	FLIP
	What?
	FELIX
	You got a Twin.
	FLIP
	Twin what?
	FELIX
	A Twin-Twin and ya Twin is a NIGGER.
	Looked in the Phone Book and went
	over what I thought was your place
	and found a Nig there.
	FLIP
	My number's unlisted. 
	What address did you go to?
	FELIX
	Over on... Bluestem Lane.
	FLIP
	I don't live on Bluestem. I live off
	21st Street...
	FELIX
	So you don't know that Nigger?
	FLIP
	Oh, that's that Nigger I keep in the
	woodpile.
	1813 South 21st Street. Come by
	sometime we'll have a Coors.
	FELIX
	And y'know what? That loud mouth
	Black Student Union Bitch that's been
	in the paper complaining about the
	Police. She was there.
	FLIP
	That Fuckin' Cunt.
	FELIX
	Like to close those Monkey Lips
	permanently.
	FLIP
	Yeah, after I get em' 'round da Head
	of my Dick.
	FLIP
	Are you Fucking kidding me?
	RON STALLWORTH
	What?
	FLIP
	You don't cross those lines. This is
	about an Investigation. Not a...
	Relationship.
	RON STALLWORTH
	You're right, I'm messin' up. Hate to
	violate that Blue Wall of Silence.
	FLIP
	Nice one.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Is Patrice a Target?
	FLIP
	Maybe.
	RON STALLWORTH
	We got Active Duty Soldiers from Fort
	Carson. Going to the CID with this.
	Our Mystery Boys Steve and Jerry.
	Still don't know who they are.
	We got Felix's Old Klan Crew.
	And we got new Klan Walter.
	FLIP
	Walter's a General without an Army.
	Felix's Crew is stronger than him.
	You've really been talking to Devin
	Davis?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Oh Hell yeah!!!
	That's my Ace Boon Coon Running
	Partner! And now that you got that
	Ronny Boy. We are on a Roll, Baby!!!
	FLIP
	Ron Stallworth
	Member in Good Standing
	Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
	RON STALLWORTH
	That's us The Stallworth Boys.
	FLIP
	Yeah, funny, but you didn't have
	psychopath staring at you asking
	where you lived.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I called to warn you, but you must
	have already taken off.
	FLIP
	Ron, I wasn't raised Jewish. It
	wasn't a part of my Life. So I never
	thought much about being Jewish, was
	just another White Kid, didn't even
	have my Bar Mitzvah. No Chanukah for
	me. Christmas. In this job, you try
	to keep things at a distance. You put
	up a Shield so you don't feel
	anything... This shit is deep. When
	that Fuck Felix had me in that room
	and I kept having to deny my
	heritage...I have been passing.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Where'd you find them?
	PATRICE
	I found this one on my Car. But
	they're all over The Neighborhood,
	too.
	Do you think this is Real?
	RON STALLWORTH
	It's Real.
	PATRICE
	This is intimidation.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Clearly, this is about the Black
	Student Union and you.
	PATRICE
	Me?
	RON STALLWORTH
	You've been outspoken about the
	incident with the Police when Brother
	Kwame was here.
	PATRICE
	So the next time they'll have a
	Burning Cross out Front.
	RON STALLWORTH
	They're trying to get to you, like
	you said they want to intimidate make
	themselves feared. If you don't let
	'em scare you. They got nothing. But
	keep your eyes open. Be Cool.
	ODETTA
	That's the problem we've been too
	Cool!
	HAKEEM
	Way too Cool!
	RON STALLWORTH
	Maybe the both of you should call The
	Cops.
	HAKEEM
	How we know this ain't some of the
	KKK's Honky-Pig-Partners passing out
	this Shit!
	IVANHOE
	Soak the Wood in Kerosene, we light a
	Cig on a pack of matches. Gives us
	time to Beat It before The Cross
	catches Fire. Safeguard against CSPD.
	FLIP
	Must be quite a sight.
	IVANHOE
	The Best. You can see it for Miles.
	Freaks out The Jew Media and puts
	Niggers on their Nigger Toes.
	FLIP
	A lot of these Guys in The Army?
	IVANHOE
	Yeah, even got a few in Active Duty.
	FLIP
	Just finished my Second Tour in Nam.
	IVANHOE
	Oh yeah? Know anything about C-4?
	FLIP
	Enough to make shit BLOW UP.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Send another one.
	IVANHOE
	Damn, that's The Second One. Pigs are
	out tonight.
	FELIX
	That makes Three Piggy Wiggys.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Good job, Men.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	...I don't share this with many
	people, but My family had a Colored
	Housekeeper growing up. Her name was
	Pinky. She was probably the closest
	Woman to me other than Mother.
	RON STALLWORTH
	That surprises me.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	I know. People think I hate Negroes.
	I don't and The Organization doesn't
	either.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	They just need to be with their own.
	That's what Pinky would say, she had
	no problem with Segregation because
	she wanted to be with her own kind.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Sounds like she was a Mammy to you.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	She was. You ever see "Gone with the
	Wind"? Pinky was my Hattie McDaniel.
	She won an Oscar for Best Supporting
	Actress.
	RON STALLWORTH
	You were Scarlett and she was Mammy.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	That's right. When she passed away it
	was like we lost one of the Family. 
	RON STALLWORTH
	A good Nigger's funny that way. In
	that sense they're like a Dog. They
	can get real close to you and when
	you lose em'. Just breaks your heart.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Well said Ron.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I knew a Nigger once.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Didja?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Yeah. Nigger lived across the street
	from us. I must of been Six or Seven.
	His nickname was Butter Biscuit.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	How'd he get that nickname?
	RON STALLWORTH
	He loved his Mama's Butter Biscuits.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Yum Yum!!!
	RON STALLWORTH
	Me and Butter Biscuit played together
	everyday. One day My Father came home
	early from work and told me I
	couldn't play with him anymore
	because I was White and Butter
	Biscuit was a Nigger.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	That's rich.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Ain't it.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Your Father sounds like a Terrific
	Man.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Thanks, Buddy.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Well, you're an upstanding White
	Christian Man. I tell you this is why
	we need more people like us in Public
	Office. To get this Country back on
	Track.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Amen.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	For America to Achieve our
	Greatness... again.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Absolutely. Sure wish we had the
	chance to chat Face to Face.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	In due time, my friend, in due time.
	I'll be in Colorado Springs for your
	initiation...
	RON STALLWORTH
	You'll be in Colorado Springs?
	DEVIN DAVIS
	You bet your Mayflower Society Ass I
	will.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	We need a new Leader. Someone
	everyone can unite behind. Felix
	would Love to be The One but we can't
	let that happen. He's a Crazy
	Sonofvabitch. A Loose Cannon. We need
	someone Articulate, who displays
	Great Leadership qualities... 
	RON STALLWORTH
	That would be quite an Honor.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	You will be Great...
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'll have to think about this. My
	father is very ill and he lives in El
	Paso. I won't have the time.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	You're a Smart and Diligent Man. I've
	got no doubt you could handle it.
	WALTER
	I think it's time for some new Blood
	to get in here. I'm planning to step
	down as your President.
	I'd like to make a nomination...
	Mr. Ron Stallworth for Chapter
	President.
	FELIX
	We just met this Guy.
	Cherry Revision 77.
	WALTER (O.S.)
	It should be you, Ron. You should be
	Chapter President. You!!!
	IVANHOE
	He just walked in off the street.
	FELIX
	Let me ask a question. Is there
	anybody here that is willing to put
	their Neck on the Line for Ron?
	WALTER
	I will vouch for Ron.
	FLIP
	It's a Big Honor but I can't accept.
	Problem is, what you Good Men need is
	a President who will be constant, on
	CALL Day In, Day Out. I'll be back
	and forth between here and Dallas.
	RON STALLWORTH
	El Paso, Flip, El Paso...
	WALTER
	Dallas? I thought it was El Paso.
	FLIP
	Did I say Dallas?
	WALTER
	You sure did.
	FELIX
	Ron which One is it?
	IVANHOE
	Make up your mind.
	FLIP
	Dallas is where my Plane layover is.
	El Paso is where my sick Father is.
	IVANHOE
	Dallas, where they killed that Nigger
	Lover Kennedy.
	FELIX
	Where you learned that?
	IVANHOE
	I can read.
	FLIP
	I just hope my Father isn't cared for
	by some Texicano Spic Nurse.
	WALTER
	We'll pray for ya Pop's health.
	IVANHOE
	And Big Spic Teets!!!
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm anxious to meet you and it will
	be something I share with my Family
	for Generations to come.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	I'm eager to meet you too, Ron.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Say, Mr. Davis... I just have to ask.
	Aren't you ever concerned about some
	Smart-Aleck Negro calling you and
	pretending to be White?
	DEVIN DAVIS
	No, I can always tell when I'm
	talking to a Negro.
	RON STALLWORTH
	How so?
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Take you, for example. I can tell you
	are a pure Aryan White Man by the way
	you pronounce certain words.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Any examples?
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Take the word "are". A pure Aryan
	like you or I would say it
	correctly... like "are". Negroes
	pronounce it "are-uh".
	RON STALLWORTH
	You are so White... Right. I want to
	thank you for this Lesson because if
	you had not brought it to my
	attention, I would never have noticed
	the difference between how We talk
	and how Negroes talk.
	From now on I'm going to pay close
	attention to my Telephone
	conversations so I can make sure I'm
	not talking to one of dem' Sneaky
	Coloreds.
	You okay?
	I would love to continue this
	conversation when you are in Colorado
	Springs. Beautiful here, Sir. God's
	Country.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	That's what I've heard, Ron. You have
	a nice day.
	RON STALLWORTH
	You too, Sir. God Bless White
	America.
	It's over!!! You can come back!!!
	INT. FELIX'S HOUSE - DAY
	Hello?
	FELIX (O.S.)
	It's Felix.
	Catch you at a bad time?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Not at all. Just... finishing a Meal.
	FELIX (O.S.)
	Meeting. My House. Now. Git ya Ass in
	gear and don't tell Mealy Mouth
	Walter.
	FELIX (O.S.)
	Welcome to The Promised Land.
	In about a week's time, we will be
	welcoming Mr. Davis to our City.
	Who's packing tonight?
	IVANHOE
	I'm packed.
	Where's your Piece, Ron?
	FLIP
	I don't carry it on me All The Time.
	The Chapter Members laugh teasingly.
	FELIX
	I got ya covered.
	FLIP
	Won't happen again.
	We're gonna need your Good Shot come
	next Sunday.
	FLIP
	What's gonna happen next Sunday?
	FELIX
	The War is gonna come to us.
	FLIP
	Fuck ya'.
	IVANHOE
	Looks like we got ourselves another
	Soldier.
	FELIX
	Just make sure that when you're at
	The Steakhouse, you've got your new
	friend with Ya.
	IVANHOE
	And give it a name.
	CONNIE
	Honey, you ever have second thoughts?
	FELIX
	About what?
	CONNIE
	Killin' 'em.
	FELIX
	Never think twice about Killin'
	Niggers.
	CONNIE
	Won’t be able to take it back.
	FELIX
	They’re da’ first of many Niggers
	that must die, Honey Bun.
	CONNIE
	I know. It’s just... becoming so
	real. It’s always seemed like a
	dream.
	FELIX
	I know. It’s just so beautiful. We’re
	cleansing this Country of a
	backwards Race of Monkey’s. First the
	Spooks then the Kikes.
	Free at last! Free at Last! Thank God
	a’mighty - Free a’ dem Niggers At
	Last!!!
	CONNIE
	I love when you do that, Honey.
	You know, we’ve talked about killing
	Niggers for so many years and now
	it’s really happening.
	FELIX
	My Old Man always told me good things
	come to those who wait.
	CONNIE
	Thank you for bringing me into you
	Life. For loving me like you do and
	giving me a purpose, direction.
	FELIX
	Y'know, this will be the Shot heard
	around The World.
	CONNIE
	The New Boston Tea Party.
	FELIX
	Honey Bun, one day, The Great
	Historians will write about us like
	that. They’ll say we were the
	Patriots that saved America. You and
	me. We turned the Tide. Saved our
	True White Race... it fact, saved an
	entire Nation and brought it back to
	its Glorious Destiny.
	CONNIE
	In a way, we’re The New Founding
	Fathers.
	FELIX
	Yes we are... Martha.
	CONNIE
	Indeed we are... George.
	MAN (O.S.)
	Mr. Stallworth.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Agent... Y?
	AGENT Y
	Names of Chapter Members?
	RON STALLWORTH
	What is this about?
	AGENT Y
	Two Names on your list work at NORAD.
	RON STALLWORTH
	The Two Mystery men. Steve and Jerry?
	AGENT Y
	Their real names are Harry Dricks and
	Kevin Nelson. Two Clowns with Top
	Security clearances. These Klansmen
	are in charge of monitoring our
	Safety.
	You've done a Service to your
	Country.
	We've been monitoring your
	Investigation. Impressive.
	Last night, Fort Carson reported
	several C4 Explosives missing from
	their Armory. No suspects.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Klan...?
	We thought they might pull something.
	But not like this?
	AGENT Y
	You won't see this on the News. For
	obvious reasons but I thought it
	might be of interest to you.
	RON STALLWORTH
	If you know about an attack, I need
	to know when.
	AGENT Y
	You're the one with the Impressive
	Investigation.
	RON STALLWORTH
	But... can't you, The FBI pitch in?
	AGENT Y
	Federal Bureau of Investigation?
	Because we never had this
	conversation.
	FELIX
	Flip, I'm starting to trust you. I'm
	gonna tell you something none of our
	Brothers know. My lil' sister married
	a Nigger. Now I got a lil' Nigger
	Niece and a lil' Nigger Nephew. Jesus
	Christ, The World's going to Hell in
	a Handbasket! Do me a favor, don't
	tell nobody. Cuz' if you do, I'm
	gonna have to shoot you dead. I'm
	serious.
	FLIP
	Thanks for sharing.
	RON STALLWORTH
	You can hate me all you want to, just
	promise me you won't go to The
	Protest.
	PATRICE
	I'm going. We're going. What are you
	talking about?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I can't say specifics but today, The
	Klan is planning an Attack.
	PATRICE
	Then we have to tell The People.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Not an option.
	PATRICE
	What's wrong with you?
	RON STALLWORTH
	No one can know while it's an Active
	Investigation...
	PATRICE
	Active Investigation? And pray tell
	how do you know all this? You a Cop?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm not a Cop.
	Silence.
	PATRICE
	What are you, then?...
	Ron takes a moment. Then...
	RON STALLWORTH
	...I'm a Undercover Detective. I've
	been investigating The Klan.
	PATRICE
	Fuckin' KKK? Ron Stallworth, you lied
	to me. Is that even your real name?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Ron Stallworth is my first and last
	name. Today's not the day...
	PATRICE
	I take my Duties as President Of The
	Black Student Union seriously. What
	is this all about?
	RON STALLWORTH
	All the good it does. You could sit
	in the middle of Nevada Avenue and
	set yourself on Fire and The Klan
	will still be here.
	PATRICE
	I'd be doing something. Unlike you.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Unlike Me? Don't think because I'm
	not wearing a Black Beret, Black
	Leather Jacket and Black Ray Bans
	screaming "KILL WHITEY" doesn't mean
	I don't care about my People.
	PATRICE
	That night we saw Brother Kwame...
	were you Undercover then too?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Patrice...
	PATRICE
	...Answer the question. Were you
	Undercover The Night we met?
	Ron Stallworth are you for Revolution
	and The Liberation of Black People?
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm a Undercover Detective for The
	Colorado Springs Police Department.
	It's my J-O-B.
	PATRICE
	House Niggers said they had J-O-B-S
	too. You disgust me.
	BUTCH
	It's off.
	RON STALLWORTH
	The March?
	BUTCH
	Yeah.
	RON STALLWORTH
	What's going on?
	BUTCH
	You'll know soon enough.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Felix just said the March was
	cancelled.
	FLIP
	Why?
	SGT. TRAPP
	Could be all the Death Threats.
	RON STALLWORTH
	They're used to that.
	FLIP
	And there's been nothing more about
	explosives?
	RON STALLWORTH
	No.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	...I have a Special Assignment for
	Ron.
	SGT. TRAPP
	Ron already has an assignment.
	RON STALLWORTH
	What's more important than preventing
	an Attack?
	Chief Bridges hands Ron "The Devin Davis Death Threat Fax."
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	There are very credible threats to
	Devin Davis's Life. Ron, I'm
	assigning you to be Security Detail
	for Davis.
	RON STALLWORTH
	I don't think that's a wise
	decision...
	LANDERS
	...Davis needs protection. There's no
	one else available.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Ron, it's Nut Cracking Time. Put your
	Personal Politics aside.
	FLIP
	Chief, it's not about that and you
	know it. Devin Davis and Ron have
	been speaking over the phone, several
	times. If he recognizes his voice...
	or if any of The Klansmen do, it
	could compromise Our Entire
	Investigation.
	RON STALLWORTH
	A Clusterfuck.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't
	you boast that you were fluent in
	both English and Jive?
	Ron is quiet.
	Do you remember that?
	LANDERS
	Answer The Chief!
	Ron goes at Landers.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Man, who you think you're talking to.
	You've been trying to sabotage me
	since Day One.
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	Gentlemen.
	LANDERS
	Why you getting so worked up, Boy?
	RON STALLWORTH
	Who you callin' Boy?
	CHIEF BRIDGES
	If you let him get to you that easy,
	you ain't got a Shot with Devin
	Davis.
	WALKER
	Listen up. First, The Primary Target.
	Felix says you’re doing it. So all
	you have to do is set the pocketbook
	on the front porch, back porch, side
	wall, doesn’t matter. It just has to
	be against the building. You can
	plant it anywhere. There’s enough C4
	here to take the whole thing out.
	WALKER
	Be careful with that.
	FELIX
	Understand?
	Felix hands the C4 to Connie.
	CONNIE
	I understand.
	WALKER
	All you have to do when you've placed
	it...
	...is flip this switch. That’s it.
	Got it?
	FELIX
	Miss Black Student Union Bitch is
	bringing in some Old Coon to speak.
	The place should be packed. So
	Walker, nothing but rubble...
	WALKER
	...And Barbecue Niggers.
	FELIX
	And what happens if that don't work?
	WALKER
	Plan B.
	FELIX
	Can you handle it, Honey?
	CONNIE
	You can count on me. I've been
	waiting to do my part.
	He gives her a peck on the lips.
	WALKER
	Lovebirds. Get a Hotel Room.
	IVANHOE
	Can I feel it?
	WALKER
	No!!! No feel!!!
	RON STALLWORTH
	I'm Mr. Davis' Security Detail.
	Hello, Mr. Davis. I'm a Detective
	from The Colorado Springs Police
	Department and I will be acting as
	your Bodyguard today.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Detective, pleased to meet you.
	RON STALLWORTH
	As you may know, there have been
	several credible Threats against your
	Well-Being.
	WALTER
	Da Heck's going on here?
	DEVIN DAVIS
	There are Threats on my Life. This
	Detective has been assigned as my
	Bodyguard.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Let me be clear, Mr. Davis: I do not
	agree with your Philosophies. However
	I am a Professional and I will do
	everything within my means and beyond
	to keep you safe.
	Davis stands there a moment, processing all of this. Maybe
	he's heard that voice somewhere before? Then...
	DEVIN DAVIS
	I appreciate your Professionalism.
	WALTER
	Sorry for the Extra Security today.
	Can't be too careful. Ready to meet
	Mr. Davis?
	WALTER
	Mr. Davis, our newest recruit, Ron
	Stallworth.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Ron, it's my pleasure to finally meet
	you in person.
	FLIP
	You as well.
	FELIX
	What's that doing here?
	IVANHOE
	Fuckin' Cop assigned to guard Mister
	Davis. Isn't that the livin' Shits?
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Everybody, it is time.
	FELIX
	You stay here. Ya hear?
	JESSE
	I'm Jesse Nayyar, Colorado's Grand
	Dragon. I welcome you all to this
	Sacred Ceremony.
	In a moment you will take a Life Oath
	to join the most Sacred Brotherhood
	this Nation has ever seen.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	My Brothers in Christ, Nobel Prize
	recipient and Co-Creator of the
	Transistor and my dear friend,
	William Shockley, whose Scientific
	work ushered in the Computer Age, has
	proven through his Research with
	Eugenics that each of us have flowing
	through our veins the Genes of a
	Superior Race. Today, we celebrate
	that Truth.
	PATRICE
	I am extremely honored today to
	introduce our speaker for today
	Mister Jerome Turner. Mr. Turner was
	born in 1898 in Waco, Texas.
	INT. PRIVATE ROOM - STEAKHOUSE - DAY - INTERCUT
	DEVIN DAVIS(O.S.)
	God... give us True White Men. The
	Invisible Empire demands strong
	Minds, Great Heart, True Faith, and
	ready hands...
	Men who have Honor. Men who will not
	Lie. Men who can stand before a
	Demagogue and damn his treacherous
	flatteries without blinking.
	JEROME TURNER
	It was a nice spring day, Waco, Texas
	May 15th, Nineteen Hundred and
	Sixteen.
	Jesse Washington was a friend of
	mine. He was Seventeen, I was
	Eighteen. He was what they called
	back then, Slow. Today it's called
	Mentally Retarded.
	They claim Jesse Raped and Murdered a
	White Woman named Lucy Fryer. They
	put Jesse on Trial and he was
	convicted by an All White Jury after
	deliberating for Four Minutes.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	God give us real Men, Courageous, who
	flinch not at Duty. Men of Dependable
	Character, Men of Sterling Worth.
	Then Wrongs will be Redressed and
	Right will Rule The Earth. God give
	us True White Men!
	Ron Stallworth, come forward.
	JEROME TURNER
	I was working at the Shoe Shine
	Parlor. After the verdict, a Mob
	grabbed Jesse, wrapped a Chain around
	his Neck and dragged him out the
	Court House.
	I knew I had to hide.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Ron Stallworth. Are you a White, NonJewish American Citizen?
	FLIP
	Yes.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Yes, what?
	FLIP
	I am a White, Non-Jewish American
	Citizen.
	JEROME TURNER (V.O.)
	The Attic of the Parlor had a Small
	Window and I watched below as The Mob
	marched Jesse along Stabbing and
	Beating him. Finally, they held Jesse
	down and cut his Testicles off in
	Front of City Hall.
	The Police and City Officials were
	out there just watching like it was a
	4th of July Parade.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Are you in favor of a White Man's
	Government in this Country?
	JEROME TURNER (V.O.)
	They cut off Jesse's Fingers and
	poured Coal Oil over his Bloody Body,
	lit a Bonfire and for two hours they
	raised and lowered Jesse into the
	Flames over and over and over again.
	The Mayor had a Photographer by the
	name of Gildersleeve come and take
	Pictures of the whole Lynching.
	DEVIN DAVIS (O.S.)
	Ron Stallworth. Are you willing to
	dedicate your Life to the Protection,
	Preservation and Advancement of the
	White Race?
	DEVIN DAVIS (CONT'D)
	In Mind, in Body, in Spirit.
	JEROME TURNER (V.O.)
	The Pictures were sold as Post Cards.
	They put Jesse's charred Body in a
	Bag and dragged it through Town then
	sold what was left of his remains as
	Souvenirs.
	Good White Folks cheered and laughed
	and had a High Ole' Time. They
	estimate close to Fifteen Thousand
	people watched it. They brought The
	Children out on Lunch hour from
	School. All I could do was Watch and
	Pray they wouldn't find me.
	One of the reasons they did that to
	Jesse was that Birth of a Nation
	Movie had come out a year before. It
	gave The Klan a Rebirth. It was what
	was a Big, Big thing back then. Today
	what they call a Blockbuster!
	Everybody saw it. They say even The
	President of The United States,
	Woodrow Wilson showed the Movie in
	the White House, he said "it was
	History written with Lighting".

	WALTER
	Please everyone rise as The Grand
	Wizard leads us in a toast.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Look around, today we are privileged
	to be among White Men such as
	yourselves, Real Warriors for The
	Real America, the One Our Ancestors
	Fought and Died for.
	We are the True White American Race
	the Backbone from whence came Our
	Great Southern Heritage. To the USA!
	Everyone in the Hall shouts: TO THE USA! Everyone stands,
	hoisting their glasses upward. Ron can see Holsters-- on
	Belts, on Legs, on Ankles.
	FELIX
	I just want to say how Honored I am
	to be in your presence.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	The Honor is Mine.
	WALKER
	He's a Cop.
	FELIX
	Who?
	WALKER
	That Guy.
	FELIX
	Ron?
	WALKER
	No, the other Guy.
	FELIX
	Ron's a Cop?
	WALKER
	No, his name is Phillip but his
	nickname is Flip.
	FELIX
	Who's Phillip?
	Walker looks at Flip as he speaks to Davis.
	WALKER
	Who’s Ron, that’s Phillip.
	FELIX
	What the Fuck are you talking about?
	WALKER
	That guy was the Cop that sent me
	away to Prison for Armed Fucking
	Robbery.
	WALKER (O.S.)
	His name is Phillip... Phillip
	Zimmerman.
	FELIX
	What!
	WALKER
	Yeah, he’s a Fuckin’ Pig.
	FELIX
	What's his name?
	WALKER
	Phillip Zimmerman.
	FELIX
	Isn't that a Jew name?
	WALKER
	I don’t know... probably.
	FELIX
	So Ron Stallworth is a Fucking Jew.
	WALKER
	Coulda’ been worse.
	Coulda’ been a Nigger.
	FELIX
	FELIX
	He's a Nigger.
	That Cop guarding Davis. Zimmerman is
	using his name.
	WALKER
	Let's tell Davis.
	FELIX
	Not now, I'll find the moment.
	RON STALLWORTH
	...Mr. Davis, a favor to ask.
	Nobody's gonna believe me when I tell
	them I was your Bodyguard.
	Care to take a Photo with me?
	DEVIN DAVIS
	I don't see any harm in that. Hey
	Jesse... why don't you get in here
	too?
	RON STALLWORTH
	You mind taking it, Sir?
	One... Two... Three!
	Right as the Camera Flashes, Ron drapes his arms around both
	Davis and Jesse, pulling them in real close. The Polaroid
	clicks and spits out the Photo instantly.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Nigger, What the Fuck did you just
	do?
	RON STALLWORTH
	If you lay one Finger on me, I'll
	arrest you for assaulting a Police
	Officer. That's worth about Five
	Years in Prison. Try me. See if I'm
	playing.
	Thanks for the Photo, Mr. Davis. Big
	Fan. God Bless WHITE AMERICA.
	Davis shakes his Head in Disgust.
	FLIP
	Boy you get ya' ass out NOW!
	FELIX (O.S.)
	Where's your Patrice? 
	FELIX
	Detective Stallworth!
	Ron JERKS his arm away heading to the exit.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Attention all Units. Be on the
	lookout for a White Pickup with a
	"White Pride" Bumper Sticker. License
	plate: KE-4108.
	RON STALLWORTH
	Request Backup. FREEDOM HOUSE.
	FELIX
	Ron, I believe you know my friend.
	FLIP
	No, I don't believe we've ever met.
	WALKER
	It's been a few years.
	FLIP
	No, sorry, I can't place you.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	Did you Guys go to School together?
	WALKER
	No, I went to a Private School in
	Leavenworth, Kansas.
	FELIX
	Isn't that where the Prison is?
	WALKER
	Matter a fact it is.
	FELIX
	You know something about that. Don't
	you, Flip?
	JOSH
	There's an emergency phone call in
	the Lobby for a -- Felix Kendrickson.
	FELIX
	Don't say another word.
	I'll be right back. Flip.
	CONNIE
	Jesus! They’ve got Cops everywhere
	here! Somebody tipped them off.
	My God there goes another one!
	FELIX
	All right, calm down, we planned for
	this. We’ll go to Plan B. Okay?
	CONNIE
	Okay... Plan B.
	FELIX
	You can do this. All right. I'll be
	right there.
	CONNIE
	All right... Love You.
	WALKER
	Excuse me Mister Davis.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	What was all that about? And why did
	he keep calling you Flip?
	FLIP
	We were in Prison together. Years
	ago. It's an inside joke.
	DEVIN DAVIS
	I hope everything's all right?
	FLIP
	Yeah, but I think he may have
	violated his Parole. Excuse me...
